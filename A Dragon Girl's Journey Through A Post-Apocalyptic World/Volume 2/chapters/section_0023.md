# 52 The Children's Way Of Survival (11)

"...I'm sorry. Can we talk?"  
  
I fought the herd of giant horses on instinct and somehow managed to
win... and finally, as my consciousness returned to "reality," someone
called out to me.  
"............"  
Kneeling on the ground, I couldn't even be bothered to move my body, so
I responded to the voice with just a glance. The person—Rin's
father—seemed momentarily intimidated and tried to raise his hunting
rifle... but forcibly threw it away through sheer force of will.  
When people make eye contact with a wild beast without any barriers,
they instinctively reach for a weapon. So, I thought his action was
"understandable," but the others who had been following behind, the
middle-aged man and the man with glasses whom I met at first, seemed
surprised.  
...So, those people were alive too.  
  
"…What about the children's parents?"  
Rin's father didn't seem to understand the meaning of the words I
mumbled, and there was a slight pause.  
"...Ah, yeah. Some of those in the truck were killed, but the families
of those children in the police vehicle are safe... though it's hard to
say, their lives shouldn’t be in danger."  
"I see..."  
It seems there were some casualties, but I made it in time before it got
any worse.  
"That... it's thanks to you. Many people fainted from that 'voice,' but
on the other hand, it calmed down those who were on the verge of
panic."  
"Mhm."  
"That..."  
He seemed to have a hard time talking, but he managed to squeeze out the
words.  
"...Did you come to help us? Did Rin... tell you to...??"  
At those words, I quietly turned not only my gaze but also my face
toward Rin's father.  
"...What if I did?"  
It's true... I did come to save them, and Rin was worried too. But... I
didn't want to tell that honestly to them, the people who abandoned
their children.  
"I... see."  
Rin's father seemed to have felt something from my ambiguous words, and
he looked dejected.  
  
I can understand his feelings... but I also remembered something more
important.  
"More importantly, you need to get out of here immediately."  
"What is..."  
"Can't you feel the vibrations? Look... the 'giant elephant' is
approaching."  
I could feel the vibrations approaching from afar on my knees, which
were still touching the ground. He must have felt it too, as his face
turned pale.  
"The cars won't move right away! Where should we run!?"  
There is a limit to how far they can escape on foot. Even if they try to
escape off-route, there's no guarantee the giant elephant won't come
straight for them.  
"For now, get away from here. ...I'll try to do something about it."  
"You!?"  
  
I don't know how much I can do with my current strength. Even if my
full-power "Dragon's Breath" doesn't kill it, it’ll only anger it
unnecessarily.  
Still, I have to do it...  
Rin's father raised his voice as I struggled to stand up using my
tail.  
"I saw how strong you are, but a giant elephant? I once saw its shadow
passing by in the distance, but that's impossible! You run!"  
"...I can at least stall it."  
"I-If that's the case..."  
He looked around and then turned as if he had thought of something.  
"...Will you be able to move if you eat meat?"  
  
He must have seen me fighting while eating the flesh of the giant
horses. As he said that, he borrowed a machete from the middle-aged man
who was a little further away and ran towards the dead giant horse.  
"...W-What are you doing, Leader!"  
The middle-aged man, who had been bewildered by the sudden action,
snapped back to his senses and tried to stop Rin's father.  
"I'm going to cut out some meat. I'm not asking you to help, but don't
get in my way."  
"But, that one is..."  
The middle-aged man cast a frightened glance at me. He was worried that
if I, who had scales on my limbs, horns, and a tail, and who ate giant
animals, were given meat and became able to move, the danger would
increase.  
But...  
"No matter what the reason, she helped us. I believe in her."  
Humans and ordinary animals have an instinctive fear of giant creatures,
even if it's raw meat.  
Even so, the middle-aged man approached him in anger, as he was unable
to cut through the skin or meat of the giant beast with his machete, and
he was trying to cut out the entrails, covered in blood, from the belly
that I had torn open.  
"You can't cut it with such technique! Let me do it!"  
"Old man..."  
Rin's father and the middle-aged man started cutting out the meat, and
not only the man with glasses, who reluctantly started moving after
seeing that, but also the family members, for some reason, started
helping.  
There were people who didn't move by the truck... and some were doing
something while looking at us with cold eyes. But the women who had been
mentally scarred by abandoning their children were reminded of their
children, and they were moving while being frightened of me.  
  
"I brought it!"  
"...Mhm."  
Rin's father and the middle-aged man brought me the innards of the giant
horse. While receiving gazes that were a little softer, though they kept
their distance from me, I began to eat the meat with my bare hands.  
Crack... crack...  
I quickly consumed the heart and liver, which would have been enough for
a hundred ordinary people, and the injured areas and missing scales fell
off, and new scales grew.  
"Um... this."  
When my stamina had recovered to some extent, the man with glasses
brought me my spear, dragging it along. It… shouldn’t be that heavy,
though.  
"Mhm."  
When I stood up and received it with one hand, the man with glasses
flinched and jumped back. Without minding that, as I started walking,
not only him but also the other humans cleared the way, and I cut off
the leg of the unburned giant horse with a single slash of the antler
spear and gnawed on the raw meat.  
  
"So...?"  
"Ah..."  
Rin's father, who had approached from behind, stopped as I asked that.  
"What are you going to do now?"  
One carcass isn't nearly enough to replenish the consumed stamina and
"heat." Rin's father, who had been intimidated by me eating the lumps of
meat in an instant, remained silent, but then started speaking
quietly.  
"...The vehicles might move if we repair them, but I realized that if we
encounter a giant animal again, we won't survive."  
"That's true... the former prison was also destroyed."  
When I said that, not only him but also the other humans gasped.  
"Even so... I think I'll go back. We'll start over again... at least,
until the children grow up and leave the nest, I'll stay in that
place."  
"I see..."  
  
He doesn't think that the children he once abandoned will ever accept
him back. Even so, he said he’ll watch over them until the children grow
up, find their purpose, and set off on their own... until they truly
need not just book knowledge but the wisdom of adults.  
...To be honest, it's not very interesting.  
But... if I think about the children... I guess it can't be helped.  
  
—Thud.  
"—!"  
At that moment, the ground, which had been constantly vibrating, shook
violently, and the adults let out tiny, tense screams.  
"...It's here."  
Beyond where I was looking, a huge shadow appeared in the mist, emerging
from the mountains.  
The giant elephant, so huge that it distorted one's sense of
perspective, felt as if it was right in front of me, even though it was
still quite far away.  
Ugh... size becomes speed as it is. If that thing starts running in
earnest instead of just walking, such a distance will be closed in an
instant.  
"I'll try to distract it and change its direction. Watching that, you
all—"  
  
—Bang.  
  
From behind me, as I was about to act with my antler spear in hand,
there was a sound like something exploding.  
"You guys! Such a thing!"  
Something flew over my head.  
The middle-aged man shouted and I turned my eyes in that direction,
where men holding something like a cylinder with both hands were sitting
on their butts with thin smiles.  
Could it be fireworks? Were there any still left? They seemed to have
modified the cylinders to be able to shoot them, maybe to use them as
weapons.  
No way, such a stupid thing!? It's a near miracle that it didn't
misfire!  
No, that doesn't matter. I hurriedly turned back in the direction the
fireworks were launched. If the fireworks hit the giant elephant, it
might become interested in us.  
But... the fireworks passed far to the side of the giant elephant, which
was closing in considerably, and exploded behind it.  
"This is bad!"  
  
***“Paoooooooooon!!”***  
The giant elephant roared and suddenly changed direction. Where is it
going? That direction is... the worst.  
  
"What the hell are you doing!"  
"Shut up, old geezer! I'm sick of it! I'll do as I please!"  
The two men who shot the fireworks threw the firework tubes at the
middle-aged man, headed towards the truck with the few men who hadn't
come this way, and at the same time, the truck's engine started, as if
they had been preparing from the beginning, and they jumped in and drove
off south.  
"You guys, get back!"  
"No way! We want to live a normal life!"  
Shouting that, the five men drove off in the truck, leaving only the
families, including the women, behind.  
  
Was that the purpose of those fireworks? To turn the attention of the
giant animal elsewhere and escape in the meantime?  
Shooting at the giant elephant must have had no meaning beyond diverting
its attention. They must have intended to use the people left behind
here as decoys to escape far away in the meantime.  
But... as a result, the giant elephant became excited by the large
explosion and sound that occurred behind it, and began to return the way
it came. That direction is—  
"The children are there!"  
  
Since those kids are clever, I think they’ll run away if they sense
danger. But what if they’re found? What if they can't escape? Even if
they run into the forest, the giant elephant will trample the whole
thing.  
"...Those guys!"  
Rin's father and the middle-aged man also noticed that and were
infuriated by the men who had run away.  
"You guys, get ready to move."  
"B-But..."  
"I'll go."  
"Wha—"  
I gave a small smile to the adults who had started to say something, and
then shot out like an arrow.  
  
I put "heat" into both legs and chased after the giant elephant with all
my strength.  
I ran like a carnivore, with my body bent forward and my tail extended
horizontally.  
"—!"  
A deep forest blocked my path. Even though I was jumping over the
branches of the trees, my speed still decreased. The speed of the giant
elephant as it ran was tremendous, and its figure, visible in the
distance, had become quite small.  
No! I won't make it!  
More... even faster!!  
That's why—  
"Fly!!"  
As I shouted that, the area around my shoulder blades became hot as if
they were burning.  
As scales grew on my back with crackling sounds, "Dragon Wings," like
feathers made of crimson scales, grew out, and I soared into the sky.  
I'm coming now!
