# 56 \[Side Story\] The White Wolf

Ten years ago, the world suddenly changed.  
While there were differences depending on the species, creatures that
could "grow" to a certain size or larger became gigantic. Most of these
creatures, with their heightened intelligence, turned against the
existence of "humans," who had previously attacked, confined, enslaved,
skinned, and eaten them.  
Unfortunately for humans, they didn't foresee this and were unable to
prepare.  
The gigantic creatures, transcending the boundaries of predators and
prey, did not fight each other but instead united in their hostility
toward humans.  
  
The animals in zoos grew to enormous sizes, broke out of their cages,
and were released into the wild.  
The livestock being raised suddenly grew in size and began to rampage.  
The animals living in the forests also became gigantic and drove the
humans out of their regions.  
Carnivores designated humans as prey and attacked to satisfy their
insatiable appetites.  
Herds of stampeding livestock destroyed buildings and roads, and
devastated infrastructure.  
In the sea, gigantic whales, orcas, sharks, and tuna attacked and sank
fishing boats, ferries, tankers, and other vessels, spreading damage
throughout the world.  
  
Finally, humanity began to fight back.  
The police and volunteers evacuated and protected the people. The
military suppressed the gigantic creatures. Military satellites
conducted reconnaissance, and large-caliber weapons were used against
the hordes of giant animals.  
Fighter jets soared through the sky, shooting down the giant creatures
from heights they couldn't reach.  
The power of modern weapons was tremendous, and humanity, which had been
on the verge of collapse, pushed back the threat of the giant creatures.
But... that momentum began to wane in less than a year.  
  
Fuel shortages due to stagnant distribution. Factories halted due to the
shutdown of power plants.  
Weapons and ammunition could not reach the front lines, and food
production also ceased.  
The reserves, which were said to be enough for several years, were only
for staple foods, and even those were not enough to feed the entire
population. Potable water dwindled, farmland was ruined, all the large
livestock became enemies; the country was hit by a severe food
shortage.  
In some areas, humans began to fight each other for the scarce few
supplies, and while they were distracted by dealing with that, the giant
animals attacked again.  
  
With the few weapons left, it was impossible to capture swift land
animals. Even large-caliber weapons could not defeat giant animals with
thick hides like elephants and rhinoceroses without concentrated fire.  
The decline of air power due to a shortage of fuel and parts. As if
anticipating this, giant apes ravaged bases.  
At sea, aircraft carriers and frigates were pierced by giant swordfish,
and submarines were crushed and sunk by giant oarfish.  
It was around this time that the socialist nations, finally feeling a
sense of crisis, released information, and the East and West began to
cooperate. However, it was already too late, and humanity's power
collapsed in less than five years.  
  
In this world facing its end, a northern superpower, where economic
activity had ceased, launched nuclear weapons at its own country as a
final act of spite, creating a mushroom cloud that engulfed its people
and giant bears.  
***"WoooOOOOOOOON!!"***  
The leader of the giant wolves, having witnessed this from afar, decided
to leave the area with its pack.  
In response, more than a dozen giant wolves howled back, and the pack of
giant wolves began to run south.  
***"Kyan!"***  
Among them was a newborn white wolf pup.  
Normally, such a young individual, unable to keep up with the long
journey, might have been abandoned. However, the giant creatures, having
grown and gained higher intelligence, had weakened reproductive
abilities, and the white wolf pup, the first to be born in five years,
was the pack's treasure.  
  
Gigantic creatures have a longer lifespan and slower growth
proportionate to their size.  
Even after three years, she had not become a fully grown wolf, and she
was the only one in the pack who couldn't hunt properly. “She” felt
impatience and frustration by the fact that she was being protected.  
After continuing their journey for four years, they tried to make the
southern part of the continent their new home, but three giant animals
that claimed that area as their territory stood in their way.  
***"GaaaaaaAAAAAAH!"***  
With white and black fur. The giant panda, fifteen meters in length,
attacked the giant wolf pack, slaughtering the leader and several
others.  
  
***"Gau..."***  
With their companions killed, the pack was reduced to five members. With
only females and old wolves remaining, "she," who had finally grown from
a pup into an adult, decided to become the pack's leader and protect her
companions.  
And so, the journey began again.  
"Her" power, newly born in this apocalyptic world, was tremendous. She
mowed down herds of giant buffalo, defeated giant tigers with the help
of her companions, and protected everyone.  
"She" instinctively decided that the direction where the sun rises was
the new land, and she crossed the sea from the peninsula and arrived at
a certain island nation. By that time, one more companion had been lost,
but it seemed to be a perfect place for her current companions to live
in peace.  
Medium-sized animals still remained. There were also large fish in the
rivers. The giant pigs and giant cattle they occasionally encountered
were delicacies. There were also dangerous creatures like giant bears,
but even the giant bears did not actively engage with the wolves, who
hunted in packs.  
They had finally obtained peace. But there was a cunning presence that
sought to exploit that opportunity.  
  
Lured out by the idea of just one, the ensuing “she” and the pack were
met with a herd of over a dozen giant horses.  
***"Gau!!"***  
Even though they were superior in burst speed, the giant wolves couldn't
compete in endurance. If they had at least the same number, the giant
wolves would have had a chance to win, but crushed by three times their
number, "she," who had all her companions killed, managed only to escape
by hiding in the forest.  
That was because the last companion wished for "her," the leader and
"treasure," to survive.  
"She," who survived thanks to her companions, chose to build up her
strength first in order to avenge their deaths.  
Still seriously injured, "she" made her way through the mountains. Even
for a giant wolf with strong vitality, continuing to move without eating
anything would lead to exhaustion.  
The temperature dropped, and it finally started to snow.  
The white snow concealed "her" pure white form. However, the cold robbed
"her" of her strength, and her wounds opened, dripping bright red
blood.  
She occasionally spotted rabbits, but in this deep forest, it was
difficult for "her" gigantic body, weakened as it was, to hunt such
swift creatures.  
***"......"***  
She finally made it out of the forest and into an open area, but she was
already so exhausted that it was difficult to even walk. A mere rabbit
alone would no longer be enough. She needed at least a small amount of
meat from a giant animal.  
Dragging her bleeding body, she continued.  
Was this the end? Would she die here without avenging her companions?
Just as she thought that, she encountered it.  
  
Bau!  
  
A creature of a different species, but close to hers, that she had seen
on the mainland, but which had not become gigantic.  
The dog growled warily at her.  
Although "she" was a different species, she had not lost her pride to
the point of eating the dog, which was a related species. She would die
here. She glared at the miserable little creature as if to say, "Go
away," and collapsed in a pool of blood, reaching her limit.  
After a while, the dog disappeared, and just as her consciousness was
about to fade, it dragged over a huge chunk of meat and offered it to
her.  
  
Bau!  
  
"She" was puzzled by the dog, who was barking proudly. What did it want?
What was its purpose?  
Before that question could be answered, the dog disappeared somewhere,
and "she" had no choice but to eat the chunk of meat.  
It was meat from a giant animal. It had been cooked, so "she" did not
feel any "power," but eating the meat restored her strength slightly,
and her wounds closed.  
***"Gau..."***  
At the same time, "she" felt something warm light up inside her.  
In the lean winter season, that dog... "he" had shared precious meat
with her. And for someone he didn't even know, who was on the verge of
death.  
  
"She," who had been given life from the brink of death, began to take
action.  
First, she ran through the forest, using her sense of smell to find and
eat medium-sized creatures like raccoons and weasels, whose numbers had
decreased rapidly due to being preyed upon by giant animals.  
Once she had regained some vitality, she hunted down a giant deer that
was in an area that might be dangerous for "him," and devoured it until
her strength returned.  
But this meat was not enough to repay the debt. Searching for soft meat
that "he" could eat, she ran through the fields and mountains, found a
hidden wild rabbit, took it to him... and "she" moved in uninvited.  
  
About half a year later, "she" gave birth.  
Giant animals rarely give birth, but perhaps the second generation was
different, or perhaps the interbreeding with a non-giant related species
was different. Eight pups were born.  
Most of them were giant animals that strongly retained the
characteristics of wolves, like "her," but only one, the youngest,
looked exactly like "him."  
It seemed that this pup strongly retained a dog-like nature, and its
childish behavior was noticeable. "She" was worried about whether it
would be able to make it as an adult, but suddenly, it appeared.  
  
A creature with a human-like appearance and a scaly tail. This
individual, descending while spewing flames from the scales that were
layered instead of feathers, gave off a powerful "presence" despite her
size.  
However, despite her great power, she did not evoke any hostility or
malice, and upon approaching her, her scent suggested that she was a
former companion of "his" pack.  
"She" was wary, thinking it was one of "his" *old flames*, but she
really seemed to be just a companion. She gave them a large amount of
meat that had been cooked so that "he" could eat it.  
"She" got a headache from her children, who had become completely
attached to her just from receiving the meat, but what concerned her
more was that the youngest pup, who had been so carefree and capricious
like "him," was the most attached to her.  
  
As a mother, "she" thought that she should entrust that child to her.
Gaining the strength to live in a world without a mother or siblings was
the best thing for it, so the family saw them off as they set off on
their journey together.  
***"......"***  
The two of them ran off with carefree smiles...  
"She" sighed, thinking that she might have been a little hasty in
sending her playful and absent-minded youngest child, and the daughter,
who had strength but seemed unreliable, on a journey together. But then
"he" barked once, as if to reassure "her."  
  
Bau!
