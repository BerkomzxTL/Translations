# 42 The Children's Way Of Survival (1)

The place I found, guided by the hand mirror, was surrounded by high
walls.  
"......It's probably a prison, right?"  
I'm not sure, but it's probably a prison. I'm seeing it for the first
time, so it might be different, but if that were a school, it’d feel
like the end of the world.  
And there are "humans" there. Because there's a little smoke rising,
like from cooking.  
"Well, I have no choice but to go there for now."  
There's no option to come this far and not check.  
I went past the burned-out buildings and the giant trees that swallowed
them up, and as I approached, the prison-like place finally came into
view.  
"......It's been attacked."  
When I got to the river that marked the boundary of the burned city, I
could see that the outer wall, which used to be cream-colored, had
several scratches on it. It seems that place was also attacked by giant
animals. If you look closely, there are holes in the concrete of the
outer wall, which are sealed with something like iron plates from the
inside.  
Honestly speaking......  
"They've survived well, haven't they......"  
No, it's a good thing that they've survived, but I wonder how ordinary
humans could have won, let alone riot police or the military. Maybe they
were lucky that there were no apes or deer or anything that could easily
get over the wall.  
  
The river wasn't that big, so I found a narrow spot and jumped over it
with momentum.  
As I approached the prison, I saw a shadow moving on the upper floor of
the building, and I could faintly hear something like human voices from
beyond the walls.  
This is...... did they notice me?  
The entrance was located in a recessed area from what appears to be a
road. There were remnants of wire netting and a building that looked
like a checkpoint, so I thought that approaching recklessly might
provoke them, so I put my luggage down on the spot and sat on it,
deciding to wait and see what they would do.  
And after waiting for a while......  
  
"Hey! You there! Where did you come from!?"  
The window of the gray building with the barricaded entrance opened, and
I could see and hear a man's voice.  
Oh...... there really were people! The second person after Granny.
......Good. Not some weird guy like Utan.  
"The east! The radio tower beyond the mountains!"  
When I shouted back, I could see several figures moving in the window,
not just that person.  
"A woman!? No, a child!? W-wait a minute!"  
The man in the window shouted again, and seemed to be talking to the
people inside.  
"Anyway, don't move from there! Don't move!"  
"......Okay!"  
I waved my hand to show that I didn't have any hostility, and the man
retreated inside.  
  
"......I don't know."  
Are they wary of humans, perhaps? I didn't expect to be accepted
unconditionally either, but to be treated with this much caution after
meeting Granny, I can feel the excitement inside me withering away.  
After a little while more...... well, quite a bit, but after that much
time, several men appeared from behind the barricade at the entrance,
moving something out of the way.  
A muscular old man of about forty in the lead.  
A sharp-eyed elderly man with a large build.  
A thirty-something man with glasses who seemed a little frightened.  
The man with glasses had something like a baton, but the other two were
pointing something dark and gleaming at me, clearly wary of me.  
"Hunting rifles......?"  
The two older men had what looked like hunting rifles, and what's more,
the muscular old man had something like a pistol hanging from his
waist.  
Could they be police officers? The three of them approached and stopped
about ten meters away.  
"......Are you a foreigner? Why are you here?"  
The elderly man muttered in confusion, and the man with glasses next to
him looked at my outfit and gave me an impolite stare, as if
surprised.  
"Hey old man, even if she's a foreigner, she's a young woman! Not a
brat."  
"I know, so calm down!"  
  
The man in the window is this man with glasses, huh. I felt something a
little strange about the way he said it, as if he hadn't seen a young
woman in a long time, and continued the conversation.  
"I'm here because of the fireworks. Isn't this the place?"  
When I said that, the elderly man and the man with glasses made faces as
if they had bitten into a bitter bug, and the muscular old man stepped
forward with his gun raised.  
"…In that case, it's definitely from here. Since it was confiscated ten
years ago, there was a danger it could explode before being
launched…Those bastards."  
......Those bastards? Was it not their intention to launch them? Did
someone who heard the radio launch them without permission?  
I wondered why there were fireworks in a prison, but it seems they were
confiscated items. What's going on? Did someone commit tax evasion or
something? The old man said that he had brought necessary things like
guns from the police station for the time being.  
I'm curious about the person who launched them, but more than
that......  
"......Are there no women here?"  
The man with glasses is staring at my legs and stomach. He's trying to
hide that he's looking by subtly looking away, but it's obvious.  
"There are women. But there aren't any as young as you, and some of them
are mentally ill, so we can't let you meet them."  
"Well, that's fine......"  
Mentally ill......? Well, it can't be helped in this world...... can
it?  
"Can I ask you a few questions?"  
"......Alright."  
  
It was small talk...... or rather, maybe an interrogation. In that flow,
I heard a little about how there are apparently twenty-three people
living here. As I thought, the muscular old man was a police officer.  
When the giant animals first attacked, the warden here released the
inmates. Apparently, he should’ve received instructions from the
judiciary, but the warden decided to use his own judgment in the
emergency.  
There may be criminals in Japan, but there are rarely any heinous
criminals. Even people who were being cocky will start working seriously
after being imprisoned for a few months. So the warden decided to use
the prison as a shelter for rescuing people and victims, and released
the inmates to help with that, but half of them ran away in a few
days.  
  
"Some civilians were accepted, but those who understood that government
relief wouldn’t come here evacuated south, including the warden."  
It seems that evacuating to the south was the right thing to do after
all. Back then, the television was still working, and the government was
posting evacuation sites.  
"So, who's left here?"  
"People who don't have the physical strength to move, and their
families. And some of the inmates who didn't run away and stayed to
help."  
At that point, the old man glanced at the elderly man, who turned away
with a sullen look on his face.  
So this is the person who was in prison...... Maybe he's some kind of
old-fashioned yakuza type of guy.  
"More importantly, young lady. What's with that...... strange outfit?"  
The elderly man said that to me as if changing the subject, and I could
feel the man with glasses looking at my legs again.  
"It's still cold, but you're wearing something like a cosplay......
eh?"  
The man with glasses who was looking at me raised his voice.  
"Wait, that tail...... it's moving!?"  
Surprised by that voice, the two of them noticed my moving tail and
their eyes widened.  
"No way...... is that real?"  
The muscular old man said that and pointed his gun at me.  
Ahhh...... I knew it would come to this. I wasn't expecting to be able
to deceive them, so I braced myself and stood up, and the two of them
raised their guns.  
"Well...... it's mine, more or less."  
Thwack, the tail hit the ground.  
"That's absurd...... things like this"  
"N-not human...... then those horns too!"  
The elderly man and the man with glasses took a step back in shock, and
the muscular old man pointed his gun at me with a stern face.  
"Don't move!"  
"............"  
The friendly atmosphere that had been there until just now had
disappeared from the three wary people, and I felt a strong sense of
caution, almost fear, and a slight sense of hostility.  
Well, I expected it, though.  
"At least listen to what I have to s—"  
"Don't come any closer!"  
  
――Bang!!  
  
The hunting rifle held by the old man blew away the ground at my feet as
if piercing it.  
"......We won't accept a monster like you. If you have any sense, leave
here immediately."  
The old man said as if grinding his teeth.  
The "emotion" faintly visible in my "Dragon’s Eyes"....... Regret?
Agony? Fear?  
"......I understand."  
I picked up my luggage in front of the three armed people, slung the
antler spear over my shoulder, and turned my back on them.  
I don't think those guns could pierce my scales right now, but it's a
hassle to get involved any further. I don't want to be completely
submissive and grovel just to have an exchange.  
I turned my back on the three people with their weapons raised and
started walking without saying anything. Those three watched me
cautiously as I retraced my steps until I was quite far away.  
I knew it, but......  
"It's tough...... isn't it, Granny?"  
  
I'm not sharing my bear meat with you, you idioots!  
  
So, what should I do? I achieved my goal of meeting humans, but there
were hardly any results.  
I guess the fact that I learned that I wouldn't be accepted by a group
of humans is a gain.  
More than that, those people are suspicious in many ways. I don't care
anymore, but I was a little curious about what happened to the person
who launched the fireworks.  
Where should I go now? I need to check my current location before I can
head south as originally planned, so I guess I should decide where to
sleep tonight first.  
Just as I was thinking that――  
――Rustle.  
  
"Hey, nee-chan with a tail! If you need a place to sleep tonight..."  
"Come to our place, onee-chan with the horns!"  
  
Suddenly, hanging from the branches of a nearby tree, a boy and a girl
appeared, dressed in tattered, soiled clothes, who didn't even look to
be ten years old yet.
