# 50 The Children's Way Of Survival (9)

I jumped out from the ruined elementary school where the children were,
leaped from roof to roof, and plunged into the deep forest from the end
of the ruins.  
In the distance, I could see dust clouds rising into the sky. Within it,
I could faintly see a gigantic shadow.  
A giant elephant. Can I really fight that and win...?  
Anyway, first I need to stop the giant animals running ahead.  
Should I use "Dragon's Breath"? Would that defeat that giant? Even if I
could turn the giant elephant's animosity towards me with that, if the
horses' legs didn't stop, then I’d be too preoccupied fighting the giant
elephant and would lose the means to stop them.  
  
Currently, the speed of the horses that can't break through the giant
trees had decreased because they've entered the forest. But, why has the
giant elephant, which should be able to break through trees, also slowed
down?  
"Ah... I see."  
The giant horses have a reason to attack humans. But the giant elephant
has no reason to attack them. What if... the giant elephant is just
following the horses?  
I don't know if they have common interests due to their increased
intelligence, or if they’re in a cooperative relationship, but if that's
the case ――  
"I'll target only the horses!"  
  
Finding a glimmer of hope, I kicked off the trunks of giant trees and
ran through the forest.  
Just like Aki and Rin used the forest to guide the giant horses, I
should be faster in the forest.  
After chasing them for about an hour.  
――Thud!  
As the distance closed, I felt the ground shake from the giant
elephant's stomping up close.  
It's huge... I’m overwhelmed by its size just by getting within a few
dozen meters of it. Its legs are like huge walls.  
Feeling the fear of being crushed if it changed direction on a whim, I
poured "heat" into both legs and ran past its side in one go.  
"――!"  
For a moment, I felt a chill run down my spine.  
Noticing that and looking up, I met the gaze of the giant elephant
glaring at me, as if I had become a noteworthy existence because I used
"heat."  
"............"  
It's okay... it's not hostile yet.  
Feeling the giant elephant's gaze, I further sped up and distanced
myself, diving into the dust cloud swirling hundreds of meters ahead as
if to hide.  
"...Found them."  
  
Catching sight of the giant horses running through the giant trees.  
I poured even more "heat" into myself, and with a kick strong enough to
snap a tree, I jumped onto the last horse in one leap.  
***"Hihhiinn!"***  
Suddenly, the giant horse, startled by my "heat" as I jumped onto its
back, neighed softly.  
Normally, it might have noticed the surprise attack, but the "presence"
of the giant elephant approaching from behind hid my existence.  
***"Hih――"***  
When it tried to alert its companions, I thrust the antler spear into
the throat.  
As if goosebumps were rising, both arms were covered in bright red
scales from fingertips to my upper arms, and the antler spear, infused
with my "heat," burned red-hot, causing the horse’s head to burst into
flames.  
The strange stench of burning protein filled the air. But, even with its
throat burned and in flames that made it impossible to breathe, the
giant horse began to thrash about trying to shake me off its back.  
"――――!!"  
I thrust the antler spear even deeper, and as I leaped onto its neck, as
thick as the trunk of a giant tree, I poured in as much "heat" as I
could and hugged it with all my might.  
***"――――!!"***  
"――――!"  
The horse and I both exerted our strengths to the limit, and at that
moment, scales rippled along my spine from my tail, and I arched back,
putting all my strength into it at once.  
――Bogyu!  
The giant horse's neck snapped, and I crushed its limp neck, burning it
to pieces.  
...Next!  
  
Pulling the antler spear from the collapsing giant horse, I jumped
forward.  
I haven't been noticed yet. Luck is on my side. Still running through
the forest at full speed, I found the next horse, kicked off the tree
trunk, and thrust the spear from above at the horse's medulla
oblongata.  
***"Burwooooooooooooooooooo!!"***  
"――!"  
It was too shallow! My small body was sent flying by the giant horse
that suddenly bucked.  
At the same time, two giant horses that heard their companion's cry were
coming towards me. But there's still luck!  
There's no sign of any other horses coming. If I haven't been noticed by
anyone other than these three, then I can just kill them here.  
***"Burwooooouooouooouoouoouoouoouoo!!"***  
The three giant horses, filled with anger after being attacked, were
closing in like a wall. Seeing that, my fighting spirit rose, my eyes
turned into those of a dragon, and both legs became covered in bright
red scales up to my thighs.  
"――Haaah!!"  
I breathed out explosively, emitting "heat" from my whole body so much
that the air shimmered, and charged straight into the giant horse in
front.  
  
Clang!!  
I stabbed the head of the giant horse, which momentarily stumbled due to
my spirit, but it was deflected by the angle of the skull. However, the
tip of the spear slid and gouged out the horse's eye, and as I tried to
follow up with another attack, a kick from the second horse flying in
from the side blew me away.  
"――!"  
The scales on both arms, which I guarded with in desperation, chipped
off and fresh blood splattered. As I flew in that direction without
resisting, the horse I first stabbed in the medulla oblongata was
waiting for me, raising its front legs and looking down with angry eyes
as if to stomp on me.  
Crack!!  
***"Buwoo!?"***  
As its front legs tried to crush me, I spun around and whipped my tail,
causing blood to spurt out from its front legs, which were then sawed
through by the sharp scales.  
"Taaaaaa!"  
With my tail still entangled around its front legs, I dug my claws into
it, using my lance as a foothold and penetrating from under its jaw all
the way to its brain.  
***"――!"***  
The horse's head burst into flames, smoldering its death throes. As it
fell, the horse with the gouged out eye and the one whose neck I first
stabbed attacked simultaneously.  
  
"HAAAAHH!!"  
Filled with “heat” in both arms, I spun the spear around and gouged the
ground, evaporating the swirling dirt, grass, and the blood of the
fallen giant horse, momentarily stealing each other's vision.  
Thud!  
I jumped through it, and threw the spear at the heart of the one that
lost sight of me for a moment.  
***"Hihhiiiiiiiiii――"***  
"Noisy."  
The spear that had been stabbed into its chest didn't reach its heart.
With the momentum of the jump, I slid under it, sharpened the claws of
my right hand, and stabbed it from below around its internal organs.  
***"――!"***  
The giant horse coughed up blood without even being able to neigh. I
grabbed its stomach and liver and pulled them out, and the giant horse
collapsed in convulsions.  
  
***"――――!"***  
The remaining horse galloped off, seeking help from its companions
ahead.  
However, the horse, not used to having only one eye, tripped on a tree
root and lost its balance, and I, who had leaped towards its back,
flexed my tail as if performing a somersault in mid-air, smashing the
skull that had been cracked in the initial attack.  
――Squish.  
  
"............Next."  
The sound of the giant elephant's footsteps approaching from behind had
grown louder because I took time with these three.  
I felt fatigued from running all this way and fighting with "heat," but
I can't stop here.  
I greedily devoured the entrails of the horse that had fallen on the
spot, took a deep breath as if taking in the atmosphere, and then ran
off chasing after the giant horses that had gone ahead.  
  
As I sped through the forest, the rumbling behind me receded slightly,
giving me a little relief. Then, as I continued to push through the
forest, I picked up faint vibrations of several horses running from
ahead.  
I've defeated four so far, but there are still some left. Five? Or ten?
How many can I defeat before the giant elephant catches up? Before
that...  
"...How many people can I save?"  
I can't protect everyone in a chaotic battle. If the horses catch up to
the adults first, they could be killed in an instant.  
As I ran through the forest feeling impatient, anticipating the worst,
my ears picked up sounds from ahead.  
"I've caught up!"  
But ――  
"They caught up too!"  
The neighing of the giant horses and the screams of humans could be
heard in the distance. The horses had already caught up to the adults.  
The faces of the children flashed through my mind for a moment ――  
At that moment, fangs extended in my mouth, the bristling bright red
scales covered my arms from the upper arm to the shoulder, thorns
sprouted from the scaled spine, and my tail stretched even further.  
Running on all fours like a beast, I burst through the forest at top
speed. When I emerged into an open area that looked like a road, the
sight of a giant horse crushing humans was reflected in my dragon
eyes.  
"Stop ittttttttttttttttttttt!!"  
  
With my tail entwined around the butt of the antler spear, I poured
"heat" into my right hand and, with all my might, flicked the blazing
red spear with my tail and threw it.  
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!  
The antler spear, cutting through the wind with a thunderous roar, flew
straight, piercing the neck of the giant horse that was about to attack
the police car.  
  
"From here on out, this “Dragon” is your opponent!"
