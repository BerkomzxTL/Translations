# 37 The Ape’s Friend (3)

***“Ooh, welcome back, Tsubaki!”***  
“ ...I'm back.”  
Thump... My bare foot, as I stepped, sank slightly into the soft ground,
and I finally managed to return to the radio tower where Utan was by the
next morning.  
  
I chased off the giant serows and recovered the solar panels that were
still intact... although I couldn't really tell the difference, so I
just grabbed the ones that looked cleaner and less deteriorated.  
The universal wrench that Utan gave me, well, the size was right, but
the bolts were rusted, so in the end I had to break them off with my
antler spear.  
There were also screws and cords and all sorts of things connected, and
even after I finally got them off, the panels themselves were quite
large, so with five of them, the weight was just barely manageable, but
it took quite a bit of time.  
  
***“This, probably okay.”***  
Utan said as he examined the panels I brought back.  
I mean, if Utan had just come with me from the start... Never mind, it's
too much of a hassle now.  
But it seems Utan wasn't just waiting around, he was preparing things
for me too.  
  
***“Food made. Tsubaki, eat.”***  
“ Ah... yeah.”  
Utan had prepared a "meal" for me.  
I wasn't expecting much cooking from an orangutan, but the sight of what
he brought made my face twitch.  
In front of me was the brutally murdered corpse of the giant serow,
chilled with snow.  
It wasn't even butchered. The head and legs were torn off from the base
with brute force, the belly was ripped open, and the internal organs
were piled haphazardly on the grass.  
  
***“Looks yummy! Tsubaki eat!”***  
“ Ah... yeah.”  
Utan plopped down on the ground and reached for the mountain of organs,
beginning to devour the intestines like a fire hose.  
***“This, tasty!”***  
“Ah... yeah.”  
Utan slurped on the intestines and held out a huge liver to me.  
Maybe because it had been a while, the strange power from the organs and
meat felt mostly gone. Still, a normal animal wouldn't be able to eat
it, but Utan seems fine.  
“You can eat that, Utan. But, is it okay to eat so much?”  
***“Huh? Me, love meat.”***  
  
The mysterious "power" residing in the bodies of giant creatures....
Because of that power, normal animals can't eat the meat, and not even
microorganisms, let alone parasites, will approach it.  
Apparently, if you leave it to dry or cook it, normal animals can eat
it, and then it’ll rot normally, but Utan, being a giant animal himself,
seems to be able to eat it raw without any problems.  
By eating the heart and liver, which hold a lot of that strange power,
my "dragon" power should also be growing, but there was no special
change in Utan, who devoured the liver I refused.  
Hmm. Was it okay because the power had faded over time?  
Or... is it only me who grows by eating giant creatures?  
  
I had eaten meat at the solar panel power plant, so I nibbled on the
wild grass that Utan was growing. Having finished most of the organs by
himself, Utan was now cracking open the serow's head and slurping out
the insides.  
He really likes meat.... But thinking about it, that makes sense.  
Humans eat vegetables and grains as their staple food and eat meat as a
necessary nutrient, but some people eat more meat than necessary.  
Apes shouldn't need as much meat as humans, but I thought that was
simply a difference in the amount they eat.  
I need a lot of food when I'm exhausted, but I don't usually eat that
much. But a giant animal would need a corresponding amount of food.  
Even the serows, who eat grass and bark, collected seeds and imitated
cultivation, and the giant gorilla in the skyscrapers formed a huge
group to collect food, but the wild grasses planted in the garden of
this radio tower are far too little to fill Utan's stomach.  
So Utan started to lean towards eating meat to fill his stomach.  
The fact that I didn't see medium-sized animals as much as I encountered
carnivorous giant creatures may be because even omnivorous giant animals
had individuals who leaned towards "carnivorousness" like Utan.  
They learned the taste of meat there and started craving more....  
I couldn't help but come to such a conclusion as Utan ate about half of
the giant serow in the blink of an eye.  
  
***“Now, panels, let's put on.”***  
“I guess so…”  
Maybe I ate like this when I was injured and starving.... Just looking
at it made me feel nauseous. Jinbei was really a good boy. Even though
he's an old man.  
I followed Utan, who started walking with the panels on his shoulders.
It's not like I can do anything even if I'm there, but I don't have
anything else to do.  
Utan seemed to be climbing up the outside of the external stairs again
like last time, but as expected of an ape, he was skillfully climbing,
supporting the panel with one hand and using his feet. I'll just climb
the stairs normally.  
***“AAAA!”***  
“Eh, what?”  
As soon as we reached the roof, Utan suddenly cried out, and I became
wary and looked around.  
***“Tsubaki, wait. Get tools.”***  
“ ...Oh, is that all? Should I go get the tools?”  
I figured I'd probably bump the panels against the stairs if I tried to
carry them up to the roof myself, but I thought I could at least get the
tools, but Utan hurriedly shook his head.  
***“Important things, there. Precious.”***  
“Hmph…”  
  
So there are important things there, so he'll get them himself?  
I'd be careful and not break anything if there was something important,
but do I look that careless? ...Doesn't sit right with me.  
***“Wait wait.”***  
“Okay, okay.”  
Utan emphasized as if there was something very important, and rushed off
the roof towards a separate building.  
I leaned on the railing of the roof and watched him open the shutter
with a parking sign on it and go inside, then come out with something
like a toolbox.  
I can't see inside from here, but what's in there...?  
  
***“Sorry for wait.”***  
“It's fine... but can Utan fix it?”  
Even though it’s a little late, I still asked Utan as he returned with
the toolbox.  
Because the toolbox itself was small enough to fit in Utan's hand, I
voiced my concerns about whether he could fix it with that. Utan
confidently distorted his face into (probably) a smile.  
***“It’s okay. Saw it.”***  
Utan skillfully opened the toolbox with the tips of his huge claws and
took out wrenches and tools I don’t know the names of. He carefully
removed the existing panels and connected the cords and connecting
devices to the panels I brought back.  
Wow, he's really skillful!  
On a human scale, it would be as tedious as fiddling with the inside of
a wristwatch with a toothpick.  
But still, because the size difference is too big, it took time, and I
squatted down and watched with my hand on my cheek. The connection of
the panels was finally completed when the sun was about to set.  
“Is that all?”  
***“After, battery, wait.”***  
  
The performance had deteriorated with age, but apparently it’ll be able
to move a little in an hour. More than that, it's still early spring, so
the sun sets quickly, so that's the limit for today.  
When I went back to the building and entered the broadcasting room, a
small light was lit on the equipment.  
“Is it already working?”  
***“Little more! Tsubaki, impatient.”***  
“ ............”  
I was reprimanded by an orangutan....  
Then Utan shrunk his huge body and fiddled with the equipment with his
claws, and when it got dark outside, Utan suddenly turned to me.  
***“Can use, little.”***  
“Amazing!”  
No, seriously, Utan is really amazing. He may have learned by imitating
someone, but I have no idea what's going on.  
***“Tsubaki, talk?”***  
“...Eh?”  
  
I was taken aback by the sudden proposal. Utan said that he can speak
human languages, but he's not very good at it yet, so he wants me to
talk.  
Well, okay.... According to Utan, it can only be used for about a dozen
seconds today. So he wants me to get someone to come here.  
Certainly, Utan's voice might make people wary. Utan turned on the
microphone and made room for me. Ahem...  
  
“――This is the broadcasting station of the radio tower. Can you hear me?
If there are still survivors–”  
  
***“――Ah, over.”***  
“That was fast!”  
It really only lasted about ten seconds! I couldn't convey what I needed
to, but Utan was still happy.  
***“This, again, ‘friends’ come. Me, happy!”***  
“I... guess so.”  
  
He said that the zookeeper had *disappeared*. If that person had
evacuated somewhere with the people from this broadcasting station, Utan
might’ve been lonely.  
***“When ‘friends’ come, together, eat food. Want kids too.”***  
“Hmm? Ah, it would be nice if kids came too.”  
Did a lot of kids come to the zoo?  
***“Tsubaki, eat food! Meat, eat!”***  
“You're going to eat it all up…”  
Utan seems to be so happy that he wants more meat again. In my opinion,
Utan eats so much that it's better not to eat all the food, but Utan
doesn't seem to think so.  
“Well, I'll go ahead.”  
***“Okay!”***  
  
The broadcasting room, or rather the building, is small, so it takes
time for Utan to enter and exit.  
I went outside first, thinking I'd start a fire outside before it got
dark, when I suddenly realized we'd left the tools outside.  
They'll rust if we leave them out in the open, right? I went back up to
the roof and took the toolbox to the indoor parking lot.  
“Huh…”  
I noticed it wasn't moving after I put my hand on the shutter.  
...Oh, it's electric. Utan seemed to be opening and closing it with
brute force, so I put "heat" into my arm and pushed it up with all my
might. But――  
Creak....  
“........What is this?”  
  
The indoor parking lot where Utan's "important things" were stored....  
The floor and walls of the opened space were stained black as if
encrusted, and filled with a large amount of "human bones."
