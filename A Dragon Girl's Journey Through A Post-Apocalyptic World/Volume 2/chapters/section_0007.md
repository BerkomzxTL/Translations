# 36 The Ape’s Friend (2)

"Panel, here."  
In the lobby of the broadcasting station that the orangutan giant ape...
Utan uses as his sleeping place, he showed me a map of this area.  
Utan is five meters tall, so even the lobby with a ceiling height of
three meters feels cramped.  
The sight of him shrinking down as if doing a squat, meticulously
flipping through a small map book with his fingertips, was, in a way,
surreal and amusing, but the content of what he was saying was
incomprehensible in places, so I'm more bewildered than anything.  
"...Solar panel power plant, huh?"  
  
The moment I read the word on the map, information merged with the
"knowledge" within me and popped into my head.  
I think it was a trend among eco-conscious and environmentally aware
people for a while, and they cleared mountains to create such places all
over the place. ...It's probably already buried in trees though.  
  
"Are the solar panels here the same specifications as the panels on the
roof?"  
***"Yes. Made together, me heard."***  
"Heeh... From whom?"  
When I asked the question casually, Utan distorted his face slightly,
whether in sadness or anger.  
***“Here, too, friends. But, disappeared.”***  
Someone was left here from the beginning? But they "disappeared" again?
Where did they go?  
Maybe the station staff evacuated south with the zookeepers. Utan is a
giant creature, so he was left behind? That's a plausible scenario,
which is troubling.  
I wanted to ask more details, but it's a topic that seems difficult to
bring up, and I'd probably not understand anyway... so I gave up.  
  
"Well, whatever..."  
I sighed lightly and stood up with just my antler spear.  
For now, I'll listen to the story later. It'll probably take a long time
if we start talking...  
Besides, fixing the panels to make the radio usable has meaning. If we
could broadcast our intentions instead of such half-hearted broadcasts,
we might get contacted by surviving humans.  
Maybe no one is left in this area. But raising the probability even a
little isn't a waste.  
  
***"Ah, Tsubaki, wait. Need five panels, please."***  
"Eh? Utan, aren't you going?"  
Being called by my name by a giant ape felt strange, but I was more
surprised that Utan isn't going, so I asked back.  
***"Me, violence, not good. Here, panels, will fix."***  
"Ah... I see."  
I don't know... Are those huge arms of yours just for show? It's good
that you're peaceful, but isn't that the opposite of what it should be,
visually? I'm smaller than Utan's arm, you know?  
Unlike humans, there isn’t much of a concept of men protecting women,
and it feels like the stronger ones fight.  
But the appropriateness of each person's role and the reason for staying
here is strangely human-like.  
  
"...Well then, I'm off."  
***"Go and come back."***  
With Utan waving goodbye behind me, I headed to the solar power plant
with the tools to remove the panels.  
I don't know... I don't really feel convinced.  
"...Can I really remove them with these tools?"  
Leaving the radio tower broadcasting station and running through the
forest, I couldn’t help but look at the universal wrench in my hand.  
...Well, if worst comes to worst, I can just break the joints with my
spear.  
"I wonder if having these kinds of thoughts makes me violent..."  
  
While running through the forest, I organized the information.  
According to Utan, there are at least five giant serows who have made
the solar power plant their stronghold.  
The last time he saw them was several years ago, so their numbers might
have decreased or increased.  
Can I defeat five of them alone? Based on the one battle, their
"presence" feels much weaker than the giant animals I've fought so far.
However, weak animals have gained power and intelligence, making them
feel "cunning," so I can't let my guard down.  
Still, if I catch them off guard and launch a surprise attack, it's not
a number I can't defeat.  
...Come to think of it, the giant apes that had the skyscrapers as their
territory were in groups, but there were no children. I don't think they
lack reproductive ability, so was there another reason they didn't have
any?  
"Ummm, I don't know."  
...Maybe I'll ask Utan later.  
  
The reason Utan was attacked was apparently because they fought over the
food supply.  
I thought, "You could do it if you try," but inferring from the nuance
of his words, it seems that Utan uprooted the trees that bore the fruit
that the serows used as food from the solar power plant and ran away.  
Of course, they attacked him. Now that I think about it, there was a
tree like that in the garden of the broadcasting station...?  
Utan didn't do it without thinking, but to feed the zookeepers... I want
to believe.  
...Right?  
  
I went out without thinking, but it was already evening and the forest
was dark.  
Maybe I should have slept for a night and gone in the morning. But, for
some reason that I myself don't understand, perhaps it's because the
language was only partially understandable, but I felt a subtle
reluctance to letting my guard down in front of Utan.  
...I wonder what it is?  
With my dragon eyes, the darkness is no problem. For food, there were
some red berries growing... mulberries? I ate them while looking at the
map and finally saw what looked like the solar panel power plant.  
I say "looked like" because I couldn't see it unless I climbed a tree.
It hadn't been swallowed by the forest, but I would have missed it if it
hadn't been reflecting the moonlight!  
It was originally an area cleared from the forest, so there were no
large trees. Whether by chance or design, the new trees growing in the
gaps between the panels had fruit on them.  
The increase in intelligence is amazing...  
"............"  
But...  
Is it really okay to fight like this? Even if I can't talk to them like
Utan, if they have the intelligence to grow fruit from seeds, can't
there be a peaceful solution?  
Somehow that thought came to my mind, so I stuck my antler spear into
the ground and headed towards the ruins of the power plant.  
Perhaps they noticed my undisguised "presence," as several giant serows
emerged from the depths.  
  
"Hey! I want the panels here!"  
One, two, three... As expected, the giant animals, over five meters
tall, are intimidating.  
I don't know if they'll understand me, but when I called out to them,
the giant serows looked at each other as if confirming, and they
twitched their noses at me pointing at the panels visible between the
trees...  
They grinned, just like "people."  
  
***"GIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!"***  
  
Suddenly, two giant serows pounced on me from behind.  
"I knew it!"  
I jumped away from the first one's body blow, and red scales rippled
from my fingertips to my biceps, and then I slammed my fist into the
other one's forehead as it attacked.  
Gaaann!  
***"Beeeheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"***  
Being lighter in weight, I was blown away too, but the giant serow's
forehead that took the punch also had a clear fist-shaped dent, and it
was staggering.  
Aah, geez! It ended up like this after all!  
Maybe Utan's scent was still on me!? How much do they hate him!?  
***"GIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!"***  
The remaining giant serows raised a cry and attacked me because I fought
back.  
I slowly exhaled and let the fighting instinct inside me “heat” up.  
***"――Giii!?"***  
  
Not only both arms, but also both legs up to my thighs were covered in
bright red scales, the large scales on my tail stood on end, and the tip
gleamed like a sharp blade.  
The pupils of my eyes narrowed, brightly coloring the scenery reflected
in my vision. The heat from my whole body burst out, evaporating the
still faintly remaining snow. The wind swirled and rose to the sky, and
my "dragon" presence was unleashed like an explosion.  
  
"――――――――――――――――――――――!!"  
  
The "dragon" roar echoed from my mouth, and I instantly jumped at one of
the giant serows, which twitched and stiffened for a moment, and with a
swipe from directly below, I ripped out its heart, the size of a
basketball, making a tearing sound.  
***"...Gigi."***  
...Thud!  
Next to the giant serow slowly falling sideways, my blood-soaked form,
devouring the still-convulsing heart, was reflected in the terrified and
trembling black eyes of the giant serows.  
  
The giant serows were weaker than other giant animals.  
They aren't as cunning as the giant gorillas, and their fighting
instincts aren’t very strong.  
I have no hostility towards these giant serows. Even if they resemble
humans, I am a "dragon," and I don't care about anyone other than those
with whom I have shared my heart, whether human or animal.  
But... still, if you choose to fight me, I will fight with all my
strength.  
  
Crack... crack... My tail and horns creaked as they grew slightly.  
***"――Beeeheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"***  
The giant serows, noticing that my power had increased by eating their
comrade, let out a cry and ran off towards the mountains.  
"............Phew."  
The presence of the giant serows disappeared, and I breathed a sigh of
relief.  
Well, I wasn't told to defeat them anyway, so this is fine, right?
