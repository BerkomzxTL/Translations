# 53 The Children's Way Of Survival (12)

Spewing "heat" from my wings made up of numerous scales spread like
feathers, I soared into the sky.  
All along... I always felt like I "could fly."  
But, I didn't know how.  
Like a fledgling constantly gazing at the vast sky from within its nest,
I looked up without even understanding what it meant.  
  
GoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!  
"............"  
The still-cold wind slapped my cheeks, and crimson wings sliced through
the sky.  
Right now, I can’t perform detailed control or stay aloft, I can only
fly in a straight line. But that’s fine. My "blood" told me that this is
how a "Dragon" flies.  
"...I see it!"  
Beyond the "road" continuing straight as if the forest had been carved
away, I glimpsed the shadow of a giant elephant, mixed in with a massive
cloud of dust.  
I won’t let it reach the children.  
The crimson scales growing on my limbs and back bristled sharply, and my
vision shifted as my eyes transformed into those of a dragon. Baring
fangs sharpened with fighting instinct, I unleashed a "Dragon's Roar" as
a signal to begin the battle.  
  
"――――――――――――――――――――――――――――!!!!"  
  
A thunderous roar rumbled, shaking the atmosphere, and the remaining
small birds surviving in the surrounding mountains all flew out at once
and crashed to the ground.  
Still, the giant elephant, excited by the light and sound of the
fireworks, didn't stop. I continued glaring at the giant elephant while
roaring, and imbued my voice with "heat."  
  
"――aaaaAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
  
―― "Dragon's Breath" ―― An enormous beam of heat flew toward the giant
elephant as a flash of light.  
"――!"  
Due to the recoil from the most firepower I’d ever used, my high speed
decreased, and I nearly stalled. I lost some altitude, but the giant
elephant's movements, struck directly by the "Dragon's Breath," visibly
diminished.  
But I haven’t defeated it yet. About to crash, I flapped my crimson
wings, which were more than two meters long, and swung my long tail to
regain my posture, soaring into the sky once more.  
I hadn't defeated it, but I should’ve inflicted a painful wound. Not
wanting to miss this chance, I imbued even more "heat" into my wings,
increased my speed, and instantly gave chase to the giant elephant.  
  
As I jumped into the dust cloud kicked up by the giant elephant, it had
turned into a scorching hellscape burned by the "Dragon's Breath." But
the giant shadow visible there was still moving.  
I flapped my wings to increase speed in order to get even closer. As I
jumped over the giant elephant's back, I saw a large, gouged-out wound
on its back. This was...  
"...Didn't reach?"  
At that moment ――  
  
***"PaooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!"***  
  
Suddenly, the giant elephant let out a cry, and from the front, where I
was trying to overtake it, a huge pillar like a train came flying.  
"Kuh――"  
The "pillar" flew past, skimming my side as I turned my wings to avoid
it.  
No, that's not a pillar!  
That pillar-like thing writhed like a snake, and as if swatting away a
small bird that had landed on its back, it blew me away with its
"trunk," despite me having evaded it.  
"――!"  
As if struck by a high-speed train, my small body was knocked down into
the surrounding forest before I had time to flap my wings, crashing into
the earth while snapping giant trees.  
"...Gugh."  
  
――Crack, snap――  
A large number of chipped scales crumbled off my wings, which I had
instinctively used to cover my body as a shield, and were replaced by
new ones.  
"Ouch..."  
Pushing aside the giant trees that were weighing me down with my
regenerating wings and arms, the giant elephant's shadow, running away
without paying me any mind after knocking me down, was reflected in my
eyes as I spat out the blood that had accumulated in my mouth.  
I had seen it faintly when flying above the giant elephant. My
wholehearted "Dragon's Breath" hadn't reached the flesh because of its
thick skin and fat.  
There was pain, but only a slight itch... Even though the fat on its
back was boiling, it had just brushed me off like brushing off an
insect.  
Was there nothing I could do? Should I overtake it before it arrives and
take the children to escape? Can I fly with them all? What if I can't
fly? What if I can't fly fast enough and it catches up with me? But――  
"I won't give up!"  
  
As if converting the large amount of giant horse blood and flesh I had
ingested, I imbued "heat" into my wings, and soared into the sky once
more as I spewed flames from the gaps in my scales.  
"――!"  
I ascended to the height of the clouds in one go. Frost clung to my skin
and hair due to the excessive speed and altitude, and instantly melted
due to the frictional heat from the air flying forward as I descended,
flying through the sky as a burning meteor.  
"There it is!"  
I caught up! But the giant elephant had already crushed the ruins of the
old prison and was heading straight for the elementary school ahead.  
It was too fast because of its massive body. Even if I could overtake it
from here, I’d burn the children with the high heat I’m currently
emitting.  
I have to stop the giant elephant. To stop it, I have to defeat it.  
But ―― what should I do!?  
"Heat, huh...?"  
At that moment, I began to doubt my own intelligence at the foolish idea
that I had come up with.  
"Dragon's Breath" hadn't defeated it. But I was able to wound it. If
that was the case, there was a slight glimmer of hope.  
I held the antler spear in front of me.  
I took a deep breath, entrusting my heart, which was wavering slightly,
to the instincts of the "Dragon." I recalled the time I fought the giant
horses.  
"I'm going!!"  
  
BooooOOOOM!!  
The wings on my back spewed flames like rockets. The sound of breaking
through the atmosphere that stood like a wall came from far behind.  
The giant elephant's back closed in on me in an instant due to the
excessive speed. The tip of the spear was burning hot, and the point was
wavering due to friction with the air. I narrowed my eyes and set my
sights on my target.  
"――There!"  
I folded my wings small and held the antler spear in front of me like an
"arrowhead."  
"――――――――――――――!!"  
Amidst the resounding "Dragon's Roar," I became a burning "arrow" and
pierced the giant elephant running ahead… into the "scar" on its back.  
  
  
  
―― Dodododododododododododododo!  
"...A-an earthquake?"  
The children were at the elementary school. Hanatsubaki had gone to
rescue the adults, and the children were waiting for her return, but
they were struck by a shake like an earthquake, and Rin and Aki guided
the small children under the desks.  
"You guys, don't come out! Rin, I'm counting on you to take care of
them!"  
"What about Aki?!"  
"Just taking a look outside!"  
Saying that, Aki ran outside, carrying one of the desks in both hands
like an umbrella to protect himself from the old ceiling materials that
were falling down in clumps.  
  
"...Something's wrong."  
Aki felt like this earthquake was not normal.  
If he had the experience of a modern person, he might have realized that
this shaking was not an earthquake but rather a "vibration" caused by
something approaching, but Aki, who didn't know the peaceful times,
didn't realize that.  
A shaking that felt like subtle tremors. And a sound resonating to match
it...  
Then, Aki, who had gone outside, felt like the shaking was echoing from
a certain direction, and when he strained his eyes in that direction, he
noticed a cloud of dust like yellow sand rising up in the distance, and
a giant shadow within it.  
"...Rin! It's the giant elephant!! Coming this way!"  
  
Rin, who was hugging the toddlers, turned pale and looked up at Aki's
scream-like voice.  
"At a time like this... Everyone, let's go!"  
"Y-yes!"  
Hina, who was roused and replied with sleepy eyes, took the hands of the
other two.  
While the ceiling of the classroom began to collapse, Rin put blankets
over the children and headed towards Aki, where she saw the figure of a
giant elephant, like a monster, approaching them with a horrifying
speed.  
"Why..."  
"Rin! Let's get away quickly!"  
Aki grabbed Rin's arm to help her stand up, but she didn't think they
could avoid it even if they ran away now. Even if they ran away now,
they would be crushed by the giant elephant before they went even a few
tens of meters, or be caught up in the rubble that was destroyed and
flying around as if bursting.  
Even if they had noticed a few minutes earlier and run away, it might
chase after anything moving.  
At least 5 minutes... no, they needed 10 minutes to escape to a safe
zone. The children could only stare blankly at the figure of the giant
elephant, which looked nearly twice as big in just a few seconds, as
their sense of fear was even paralyzed.  
But...  
At that moment――  
  
――......Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!!  
  
If they had possessed the knowledge, they would’ve heard something like
*the sound of a jet plane*. The burning luminous body approaching at
high speed caught up from behind the giant elephant and pierced its
back.  
BOOM!!  
"Kyaaaaaaah!?"  
"Grab on!"  
A thunderous roar resounded, and Rin screamed while covering the
toddlers, and Aki hugged them.  
  
***"PaooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!"***  
  
The roar of the giant elephant shook the atmosphere, and cracks appeared
in the remaining window glass of the elementary school.  
Zuzun....  
The elephant's movements, which had been vibrating violently up until
then, visibly slowed, and Aki, noticing this, shook Rin and the
others.  
"I don't know, but now's our chance――"  
"Wait... that..."  
  
...Zuzun.  
A large amount of steam rose from the back of the giant elephant where
something had pierced, and steam rose from its entire body. The giant
elephant, spitting out boiling blood from its mouth, slowly collapsed in
front of the elementary school.  
Dodoon...!!  
"Hih."  
The windows of the elementary school broke and the ceiling collapsed due
to the vibrations from the fall, making Hina and Riku scream.  
"What...is...?"  
"Huh!"  
The giant elephant was emitting steam so hot it could be felt from where
they stood. A huge flame erupted from the boiling wound on its back, and
from there emerged a figure...  
"Tsubaki... nee-chan?"  
It was Hanatsubaki, covered in blood with crimson wings and a long tail,
with a demon-like appearance and flames swirling all over her body.
