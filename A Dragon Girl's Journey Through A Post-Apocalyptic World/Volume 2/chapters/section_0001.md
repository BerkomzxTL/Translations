# 30 A New Journey

**Volume 2: A World For Someone To Live In**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"  
Bang!  
From the depths of a dense thicket, a young "girl" let out a scream
quite unbecoming of a maiden and leaped out.  
Not only were the words and actions of the girl, who dashed out from a
forest of giant trees with great force, out of the ordinary, but her
appearance was as well.  
She carried a large leather bag and a horn-like spear that was faintly
tinged with red. Her attire consisted of a chestpiece and loincloth made
of fur, generously exposing her lustrous, pale reddish-tan skin.  
Her reddish-silver hair was tangled with leaves and twigs from the
trees, and from it grew crimson crystal horns.  
And then there was her tail, more than a meter long, covered in red
scales...  
A few seconds after that girl, the dragon girl *Hanatsubaki*, ran
through...suddenly, the forest of giant trees began to swell outwards as
if being pushed from the other side.  
  
Dogooooooooon!!  
  
In the next instant, the giant trees in the thicket were snapped, blown
away from their roots, scattering a large amount of leaves and soil,
along with the remaining snow, like an eruption.  
  
***“Gugooooooo!”***  
From within the cloud of dust, a giant crocodile, thirty meters in
length, appeared and cornered Hanatsubaki, who seemed far too small in
comparison to its massive body.  
"Why are you chasing me!?"  
  
The incident began a week prior. Hanatsubaki overcame a sad farewell and
started walking south along the train tracks.  
The encroachment of giant trees did not extend to the elevated tracks,
and walking on the large amounts of gravel suppressing the encroachment
of weeds was more pleasant than walking on the road.  
There were several towns along the way, and by scavenging there, she was
able to find a small number of remaining canned goods.  
But Hanatsubaki was faced with a choice.  
The high-speed railway line split into two: one at a high elevation, and
the other being a local line that ran at a lower elevation.  
The local line, which led away from the city, would eventually run along
the ground. There would be fewer towns, and the tracks would be buried
in weeds, making it easy to get lost.  
The high-speed railway line was easy to walk on, but it was clearly
heading towards the mountains.  
It seemed like she could find food if she searched the mountains, but if
she went too deep, there was a risk of encountering giant boars and
giant deer again. After agonizing over this, Hanatsubaki chose to begin
walking along the local line, which was dotted with stations and
probably houses.  
As Hanatsubaki predicted, the tracks were no longer elevated and ran
along the ground. Fortunately, there were an endless amount of towns and
houses, and although she did not encounter any people, she found a
surprising amount of food among the ruins.  
But then a problem arose. Water.  
There were about three narrow rivers along the way, where she was able
to replenish her food and water. However, from a certain point onward,
she could no longer find any rivers, and her water ran out. She had been
quenching her thirst with drinks from vending machines, but after three
days, she started to worry about the dirt on her body. When she
approached what was the largest river she had seen so far with joy and
enthusiasm, a giant crocodile appeared.  
  
And so, she had been running away for several hours, but the crocodile
would not give up even when she entered towns and forests, and it felt
like it was stubbornly chasing her.  
"Youuuu!!"  
Hanatsubaki had thought that she could avoid the fight by running, but
she was reaching her limit. She threw down her luggage and readied her
antler spear.  
Hanatsubaki was far too small to be seen as “food”. If it was looking
for food, it would be better off targeting fish in the river. But
Hanatsubaki had faced multiple giant creatures by now and understood
them to some extent.  
Leaving aside out-of-the-ordinary creatures like the island whale, the
giant deer, the giant boar, the giant shark, and the giant ape, to
varying degrees, were all wary of Hanatsubaki from the start. Viewing
her not as food, but as an "enemy,".  
  
***“Gugoooo!”***  
The giant crocodile, faced with Hanatsubaki stopping in the grassland,
did not slow down and instead charged with its fangs bared.  
Hanatsubaki narrowed her golden pupils vertically, like a "dragon," and
poured "heat" into both legs, which were being covered in rippling red
scales, as she leaped out like a released arrow.  
She flew over the head of the giant crocodile, which had its mouth wide
open and was five meters tall, and swung her antler spear down on the
giant crocodile, aiming for its heart from directly above.  
Crack!!  
"――!"  
Hanatsubaki grimaced at the sensation as if hitting a large rock.  
The antler spear pierced the scales on the giant crocodile's back
without breaking, but due to the enormous size difference, it was
probably like a mosquito bite for the giant crocodile.  
But even so, it didn't change the fact that it was an unpleasant
itch...  
  
***“Guooooooo!!”***  
The giant crocodile, roaring, thrashed about to shake off Hanatsubaki on
its back, and, in the blink of an eye, transformed the grassland into
bare earth.  
However, this was not because it felt threatened by the pain. The giant
crocodile, whose intelligence had increased, was trying to attack
Hanatsubaki out of anger at being attacked by a small creature.  
"Kuh!"  
In response, Hanatsubaki clung to the antler spear that she had stabbed
into it, and used the claws on her feet and her tail to resist the
rampaging giant crocodile. If she were shaken off, she would have to
fight it head-on. But if she stayed on its back, its attacks wouldn’t
reach her.  
Hanatsubaki grew scales on both arms and put "heat" into them, stabbing
the antler spear even deeper.  
But――  
  
BAAAAAAAANG!!  
The giant crocodile slammed its giant tail against the ground and used
the recoil to catapult Hanatsubaki's small body like a rodeo.  
"――Eh?"  
Bakun!  
In the next instant, the giant crocodile twisted its body and swallowed
the launched Hanatsubaki whole in one gulp.  
Zuzun... The giant crocodile, having finally landed with a rumble and a
cloud of dust, twisted its mouth into a smile as if pleased with
itself.  
  
It was by chance that the giant crocodile, which claimed this area of
the river as its territory, encountered her. But from the moment it laid
eyes on her, the giant crocodile felt an unpleasant emotion.  
It had spent ten years preying upon or driving away the giant creatures
in the area.  
There were no creatures that could defeat it. Even the iron boxes that
breathed fire and were ridden by the "two-legged" creatures that used to
be so numerous ten years ago could not kill the giant crocodile, even if
they burned its scales. It could crush them with a swing of its tail.  
The existence that such a giant crocodile found unpleasant...it closely
resembled a "two-legged" creature, but for some reason, it intuitively
felt that it should not let it live.  
Now that it was gone, its worries were gone. It was too small to crush,
but even a giant bull would have to give up on life and become food if
it fell into the fangs of a giant crocodile.  
Perhaps because it had been eating only fish lately, its stomach felt
warm from eating a land creature for the first time in a while...  
  
***“Goo…!?”***  
The warmth in its stomach gradually increased and became hot, and along
with feeling a "heat" so intense that it felt like a terrible
stomachache, its stomach began to vibrate as if "roaring."  
The moment the giant crocodile was about to head towards the water's
edge――  
***――――――――――――!!***  
A "scorching flash" pierced the giant crocodile's back and ascended into
the sky.  
***“GoOOA!?”***  
The giant crocodile spewed a large amount of blood from its mouth, and
when it heard the "dragon's roar" reverberating from its back, it
understood that the cause of its discomfort was "anxiety." In the next
instant, its head was blown off by the scorching flash that swung down
and split it open, ending its life.  
  
  
"...Buhah!"  
Crawling out of the hole in the giant crocodile's back, I let out a deep
breath.  
"Uwa...slimy..."  
My whole body was covered in stomach acid and blood, and it felt really
gross.  
The blood had washed away a lot of it, but I could still feel a slight
tingling pain on my skin, probably because the stomach acid was so
strong.  
"I want to wash up soon..."  
Thinking that, I looked around and saw that I wasn't far from the river,
so I ran and jumped in.  
  
I surfaced from the water and carefully washed my hair and horns. Ah, I
feel like my hair is damaged... The fur also looked bad, so I carefully
washed it with water and dragged my body up to the riverbank.  
"Aaaaah...I'm so tired~"  
I felt exhausted all over my body. The battle itself was short, but
that's not because the opponent was weak.  
It's because there’s no way I would’ve won without using the "Dragon's
Breath."  
This "Dragon's Breath" releases the "heat" inside me, so it makes me
extremely tired.  
This is the third time I've used it, but the first two times I was
desperate and didn't have the leeway to understand how tired it made me,
so I didn't notice.  
  
Guuuuuuuuuuuu....  
"..."  
And, it seems like I get really hungry too. If this area was the giant
crocodile's territory, then were all the big fish wiped out?  
Also, since this is such a big river, there might be more of the same
species still alive.  
Falling onto my back on the riverside, I noticed, with a brief glance to
the side through the accumulated snow, something vividly green...
butterbur sprouts were peeking out.  
I see...  
"Spring's coming... Granny"
