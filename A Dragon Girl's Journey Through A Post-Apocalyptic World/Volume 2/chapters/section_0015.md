# 44 The Children's Way Of Survival (3)

"We usually gather vegetables and dig up potatoes in the forest,"  
"I don't like that red one!"  
"Red one?"  
Five children living in the abandoned elementary school.  
As I interacted with them, the sun set before I knew it, and Sora, the
youngest, complained of being hungry, so we decided to have a meal. Can
these children really manage to have a proper meal by themselves? When I
asked, Rin told me about how they procure food.  
The *red one* that Aki mentioned, when I asked more about it, sounds
like a tomato? Why are there tomatoes in the forest? I don't know if
it's a tomato for sure, but if it's a semi-wild tomato, it probably
smells grassy.  
  
"We still have some vegetables we picked yesterday, but... we don't have
any crayfish left, do we?"  
"That's right! Since we have a guest, let's open a can!"  
Because I'm here today, Aki suggested that to Rin.  
It seems the children go around to abandoned houses far away to collect
canned goods and dried noodles for times when it's difficult to get
food, like in the winter. ...They're surprisingly pragmatic.  
If they're eating canned goods and dried noodles even occasionally, they
probably aren't in too bad a nutritional state. They mentioned crayfish,
so since the river is probably close by, they might be catching fish
too.  
The kids were going to open a can for me... or maybe they just want to
eat it themselves, but I felt bad that "Onee-san" was going to consume
the food that they’ve worked so hard to collect.  
"Everyone, you know, I said I have meat. Bear meat!"  
When I pulled out the leather bag that was stuffed to the brim with bear
meat and tapped it, the three toddlers' eyes lit up at the word "meat,"
and we ended up having yakiniku today.  
  
"This, and this, and..."  
"So much!?"  
As I took out one piece of bear meat after another wrapped in big
leaves, Aki's eyes widened when he realized that the contents of the
leather bag was really only bear meat, and Rin looked at me with an
astonished expression.  
"Tsubaki-oneechan, you really don't have any clothes, do you..."  
I'm sorry! I'm practically a nudist!  
The children's clothes were dirty, but they weren't wild style like me;
they're proper, normal clothes.  
"We get our clothes from a place far away called um... 'super'? Because
if I or Rin go to the one that's close by, we get scolded!"  
"I see..."  
Get scolded... by whom? It's obvious. The adults who abandoned them.  
Even from interacting with them just a little bit, it doesn't seem like
the children rely on adults, so maybe the adults are managing the nearby
supplies for their own survival.  
The current supplies and such will likely become mostly useless in
another ten years, but I guess the adults can't abandon their previous
way of life.  
Well, that's just my imagination, so I'll refrain from commenting on it
any further.  
  
"Anyway, time for dinner! How much meat do you want to eat?"  
"Ummm, lots!"  
"Lots, huh."  
I feel like about one kilogram of bear meat would be enough, but I’ll
use three kilograms. Eat until your bellies are full! Rin brought me
some small potatoes and onions, so I guess we can make yakiniku and
stew?  
This elementary school used to have a cafeteria, but as expected, they
couldn’t cook with giant pots. But there were various pots and dishes
left in the home economics room, so the children had been using those to
eat.  
They usually cook in the home economics room, but since we're having
yakiniku this time, we're going to cook outside the classroom.  
We took out the desks from the classroom and sliced the meat thinly,
putting it into a pot. It's hard to cut the meat of giant animals with a
normal kitchen knife, so I used my tusk knife, and in the meantime, Aki
started a fire with matches, and Rin used a knife that she brought from
the home economics room to cut the potatoes and onions.  
"""..."""  
Meanwhile, the three toddlers are just watching me work, seemingly
finding it enjoyable.  
Maybe it's fun to watch something being made, or maybe they're happy to
have someone make them a meal.  
But it's a little hard to work when I'm being stared at so intently. I
learned how to cook from Granny, but when I looked away for a moment
from the unevenly sliced meat, Sora suddenly reached out and put a piece
of raw meat in her mouth.  
"Wait, that's raw!"  
I panicked, thinking that raw meat is definitely bad for a child... or
rather, for a human, but Sora smiled happily with the raw meat still in
her mouth.  
"Yummy."  
"Eh... it's yummy?"  
  
Looking at Aki and Rin, they didn't seem particularly panicked. Since
the meat of giant animals doesn't have any parasites, maybe it doesn't
have any scary bacteria? Thoughts swirled around in my mind, and when I
looked at Aki and Rin as if seeking an answer, they gave me an answer
that was, puzzlingly, only slightly different from what I expected.  
"We eat it sometimes too, but Sora especially likes raw meat."  
"Does your stomach hurt or anything?"  
When I asked hesitantly, Aki looked at me with a blank expression.  
"It's fine?"  
"Ah, my stomach hurt a little once! But I kept eating it because Aki was
fine, and then it stopped hurting."  
Rin almost got a stomach ache before, but she got better by continuing
to eat it? Does that mean that they're fine even with normal animal
meat? Aren't they tougher than I was before I strengthened my stomach?  
"Sora can eat as much as she wants!"  
"Yeah!"  
"Me too!"  
"Me too!"  
Sora nodded with a full smile as Rin stroked her head, and Hina and Riku
also raised their hands as if they were jumping. They're really fine...
huh? Wait?  
  
"Aren't you scared of eating the meat from big animals?"  
Even parasites and microorganisms don’t come near it until it dries out,
and even Jinbei didn't approach it until it was cooked, but the children
only saw the meat of giant animals as "food" from the beginning.  
"Why would we be scared? Tsubaki-chan."  
Hina looked up at me with a truly puzzled expression. They're really
fine... but I also noticed that Aki and Rin were making subtle faces out
of the corner of my eye.  
These kids probably know that adults reject the raw meat of giant
animals.  
The reason why the three toddlers prefer raw meat more than the older
Aki and Rin is probably because Aki and Rin grew up in that former
prison until they were a certain age, and were made to eat cooked
food.  
  
The children don't fear the "night." They don’t seem to mind working in
the dark after the sun goes down, and they even squinted when a fire was
lit; their night vision is good.  
The children don't fear giant animals. They recognize them as strong
beings, but to them, they're just big animals.  
These kids have no problem eating the raw meat of giant animals that
adults can't eat  
The adults at the former prison were just humans.  
Then, what are these children who were born after the world
changed...?  
That might be the reason why these children are living apart from the
adults, but I hesitated to ask about it in detail.  
...Well, whatever. For now.  
  
"Dinner's ready~"  
When I said that, the toddlers cheered and came running over.  
Since it was an elementary school, there were lots of desks and chairs,
but since everyone is a different height, we sat around the campfire and
ate the meal in a circle.  
Rin handed me a spork, which I guess they used for school lunches, and
when I received the stew that was poured into a plastic bowl from Aki,
for some reason Sora took a seat between my legs as I sat cross-legged
as if it was the most natural thing in the world.  
"""Itadakimasu!"""  
Five-year-old Hina could eat by herself just fine, but Rin was helping
Riku, who was a little clumsy with his eating. And then there's the
youngest, Sora.  
"Chubaki! Yummy"  
"Yeah, it's yummy, isn't it?"  
She used the spoon like she was gripping it, and was spilling stew all
over my legs.  
Well, I don't feel the heat, and I don't have clothes that would get
dirty, so it's fine, but Sora's precious clothes might get dirty even if
they're just slightly soiled, so I ended up feeding her myself.  
There weren’t any cloths, but there were some that Aki and Rin gathered
from the neighborhood, so when I wiped Sora's mouth with one, Sora
smiled brightly and looked up at me as if she was happy about it.  
As I thought... it was too early for her to be separated from her
parents.  
  
I want to ask her why they ended up living here, why they were
abandoned, all sorts of things, but it's not something to talk about in
front of the little ones.  
It seems like Aki and Rin are going to go look for food tomorrow, so
I'll try to ask them a little bit then.  
The children all sleep together. Even Aki and Rin, who seem mature,
probably miss the warmth of other people.  
The children were wrapped in well-worn blankets, and since I don't like
fabric, I was just about to lie down and go to sleep, when Sora snuggled
into my chest, and when Hina and Riku saw that, they gathered around too
before falling asleep.  
I reluctantly endured it and put the blanket over the children, and when
Rin noticed that, she whispered to me.  
"Tsubaki-oneechan... I want you to teach us how to read and write. And
how to cook too."  
  
These children have probably been living by trial and error based on
what they saw when they were little. But Rin was feeling the limits of
what she could do, so she asked me to teach them.  
"Yeah, sure. But tomorrow."  
"Okay... good night, Tsubaki-oneechan..."  
I could hear Rin's breathing as she quickly fell asleep.  
  
For now... I’ll just have to endure the tickling sensation of the fabric
until morning.
