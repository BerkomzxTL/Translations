# 49 The Children's Way Of Survival (8)

"Nee-chan is!?"  
"That's reckless!"  
I, alone, will deal with the giant animal that’s chasing the adults.
While Aki, Rin, and the younger children were surprised, I gave a small
wry smile.  
"You two were trying to do something about it yourselves, right? Leave
it to me. I'll go."  
I patted the shoulders of Aki and Rin, who were trembling slightly with
anxiety, and nodded firmly.  
No matter how much Aki and Rin have physical abilities beyond those of
children, if I let them go, they’ll almost certainly lose their lives. I
don't think I can handle such a huge animal head-on either, but I have a
chance of surviving.  
  
"Well then, I'm off."  
I stroked the heads of Hina, Riku, who were looking up at me with
tearful faces, and then Sora, who was looking down, in turn. Finally,
Sora jumped into my arms and hugged me.  
"Chubaki..."  
"It's okay. ‘Nee-chan’ is strong, after all!"  
I put my hands under Sora's arms, lifted her up to my eye level, and
gave her a bright smile. Sora finally nodded slightly and let go of
me.  
"I'm off."  
  
With the worried, anxious eyes of the children at my back, I put "heat"
into both legs and dashed out like a gust of wind, carrying only my
antler spear and tusk knife.  
"...Is that it?"  
Concentrating my awareness, I could faintly catch a "presence" that
seemed to be to the south. Climbing to the top of a tall building to
confirm, I see an enormous cloud of dust and a huge shadow in the far
distance.  
To be able to see it from this distance, how huge is it...? Anyway, it's
gotten quite far away. If it's a giant horse, it should be faster than
the original horse, but if it's an elephant with such a huge body, it
may be able to move at an even greater speed.  
"............"  
...To be honest, I have mixed feelings about saving the adults who
abandoned the children. But...if I abandon the adults, it will surely
leave a scar on Rin's heart.  
Thump!!  
From the rooftop of the ruined building to another roof, I ran through
as fast as I could, shaking off the dregs in my heart.  
  
  
  
"Can't you go any faster!"  
"This is the limit! If you have a problem with it, go ahead and move the
fallen trees!"  
Two vehicles, a police escort vehicle and a truck, were traveling along
what appears to be a road surrounded by trees. The driver, a middle-aged
man, shouted back at the voice coming from the truck bed.  
The adults who set off for the New World... the southern shelter where
the surviving Japanese are supposed to be, weren’t making much progress
on their journey.  
  
"Damn it...is this really a 'road'?"  
The middle-aged man, a former prisoner, muttered in a rough tone. The
man in glasses in the passenger seat raised his face from the paper map
he was staring at, frowning.  
"There shouldn't be any mistake. It can't be helped, given the current
state of things."  
  
They were supposed to head south using the national highway that
connects prefectures, but although the road was spared from the
encroachment of giant trees thanks to the asphalt, the fallen leaves
that had accumulated over the past ten years had turned into soil,
making it difficult to distinguish the boundary between the road and the
forest.  
The fact that it was originally a road meant that it was flat, which was
helpful, but here, too, giant animals had rampaged, and destroyed cars
and fallen trees were blocking their way.  
The man in glasses, a former city hall employee, was in charge of
evacuation in the former prison area, but as a newcomer, he didn't know
what to do and was late in evacuating.  
Since he had no particular skills or knowledge, he feared being isolated
in the settlement, so he collected paper maps and information from
police boxes and government offices, which made him responsible for odd
jobs in the settlement. As a result, he was unable to go with the other
young people when they left the settlement.  
It was the man in glasses who was most dissatisfied with this and wanted
to leave that settlement more than anyone else.  
  
"Even so, the old man..."  
"...The leader decided it. We all agreed, didn't we?"  
The middle-aged man made a face as if he had bitten into a bitter bug at
what the man in glasses was about to say.  
The police vehicle in front was carrying families and elderly people,
including women, but the truck bed was full of former prisoners and
single people, including the two former university students who caused
the children to be unable to stay in that settlement a few years ago.  
The adults considered exiling them after they tried to assault a woman
and were almost killed by the children.  
However, they showed mercy because they said they regretted their
actions and were seriously injured, which meant they would almost
certainly die if they were exiled.  
"It was a little weird to exile the children but show mercy to those
guys..."  
"Well, it can't be helped. We 'humans' are different from 'those
children'..."  
  
Aki and Rin were still young at the time, but they already possessed
physical abilities that surpassed those of adults and the mental
"strength" to survive in this world.  
Because those children showed "strength" that was different from the
values of the adults, the criminals remained, and the children who did
the right thing were rejected as "foreign elements."  
Even the two university students who had done so much were still within
the scope of what the adults could understand.  
However, the attitude of the two university students had been getting
worse. They had caused problems, which had made the eyes of those around
them more critical, putting them in an awkward situation. After five
years, even their sense of guilt had faded, and they had begun to act
out of line now that there were no children around.  
  
In the former prison settlement, people went to the trouble of
collecting batteries and turning on radios as much as possible for
information gathering purposes.  
Until a few years ago, a "muffled voice" would occasionally broadcast,
inviting people to the radio tower over the mountains, and several
groups of refugees actually heard the broadcast and headed there.  
Then just recently, for the first time in several years, a voice came on
the radio again, and the two former university students, who were
thinking of leaving this settlement, used the signal fireworks that had
been reserved for communication without permission.  
As a result, they attracted a "girl," but she was far more "different"
than the children the adults had driven out.  
Even so...  
  
(...It was such a waste.)  
The man in glasses muttered to himself in his heart. Certainly, those
who agreed to drive out the children wouldn't be able to accept someone
with horns and a tail, but he, with his knowledge of games and anime,
was more fixated on the fact that she was a young "woman" and had
lingering feelings for her body.  
At the time, he was indignant at what the two former university students
had done, but as the settlement gradually aged, he, too, began to desire
young women.  
The people in this truck are single people who have come to have such
thoughts. The middle-aged man and the man in glasses were also in charge
of supervising them, but the man in glasses was also on the verge of
becoming the same kind of scoundrel.  
  
"―Hey, another fallen tree! Someone help me!"  
They heard the voice of the leader from the police vehicle ahead.  
"Got it! Hey, some of you go."  
Several people stood up at the middle-aged man’s call, but the two
university students didn't move from their blankets, which they were
using a cushion, and complained again.  
"Again? Just hurry up and go."  
"You guys help too!"  
"...Old man."  
Just as the middle-aged man started yelling again, the man in glasses
called out.  
"What is it? I'm going to—"  
"Isn't it shaking...?"  
They felt a slight vibration. Being an island nation with frequent
earthquakes, this level of tremor was not unusual. However, precisely
because they were accustomed to earthquakes, they realized that this was
a continuous "vibration" different from a normal quake.  
"Could it be...Leader! They're coming!"  
  
Thud!!  
***"BwooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
  
They heard the sound of multiple beasts neighing, resonating like
low-pitched wind instruments, and the leader, who was the first to
regain his senses among the adults whose faces turned pale in
astonishment, raised his voice.  
"Get the cars out of here!!"  
"But the fallen trees..."  
"Drive over them! Everyone, grab onto something!!"  
Clang!  
"...Damn it."  
The leader cursed under his breath as he forcibly drove over the fallen
trees, and screams echo from inside the car. He tried to figure out in
his head how this happened.  
The herd of giant horses is chasing them. But how did they find out
where they were? And why are they chasing them in the first place?  
He could understand that the horses were territorial over the former
prison and were hostile to them. They’ve also shown that they can set
traps and defeat the horses. Even so, if they abandoned that area, there
should be no reason for them to attack.  
But the leader... "humans" did not understand.  
That the intelligence of giant animals had increased to the level of
humans.  
That they were now able to follow the tracks due to their increased
intelligence.  
And... he did not understand that they had come to harbor grudges and
hatred like humans, and had become "malicious" enough to never forgive
their opponents. He was trapped by the common sense of a peaceful era,
and underestimated them as just horses.  
  
Bam!!  
***"BluroooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
Multiple giant horses appeared from the left and right sides of the road
the cars were traveling on, as if piercing through the forest.  
  
"Damn it all!!"  
The middle-aged man driving the truck turned the steering wheel to avoid
a giant horse that had cut in front of him.  
Screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeech!!  
Although they managed to avoid overturning, people were thrown out of
the truck bed along with a large amount of cargo, as there were no
seatbelts or even seats.  
"...Ah—"  
An old man reached out for the banknotes he was holding dear as they
flew through the air—  
—Squish.  
***"BluroooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
One of the giant horses mercilessly trampled them, and the people who
were thrown out were trampled as the following horses galloped past.  
  
The giant horses that galloped past approached the police vehicle
ahead.  
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
The leader desperately gripped the steering wheel and continued to step
on the accelerator, but the speed was too different. Just as humans
cannot escape from beasts in the mountains, they easily collided head-on
with a giant horse that was five meters tall and had circled around to
the front, even though they slammed on the brakes.  
  
Thump!  
"Gaah!"  
The occupants of the car were thrown to the floor by the force of the
impact, and the leader hit his forehead hard on the steering wheel.  
The giant horse was also thrown back, but didn’t fall. It slowly peered
into the driver's seat, where the glass had been shattered.  
"Y...ou..."  
The leader, bleeding from his forehead and dazed from the concussion,
aimed his trembling hands at the giant horse peering in, but the horse
bared its teeth as if mocking him, and wore a distorted, gleeful
smile.  
  
WhoooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!!  
Thud... !  
  
At that moment, a scorching red "antler spear" came flying in with a
violent whistling sound, piercing the giant horse's neck and setting it
ablaze.  
At that moment, the leader saw a "small dragon" in his hazy, blurred
vision.
