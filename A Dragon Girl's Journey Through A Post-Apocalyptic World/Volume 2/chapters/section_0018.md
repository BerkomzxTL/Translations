# 47 The Children's Way Of Survival (6)

"Aki\~. Make sure you wash Riku properly, okay\~~?"  
"I know! Rin, don't come over here!"  
Today is bath day. It's not like we bathe on a specific day, but when we
feel dirty or uncomfortable, we wash our bodies. So, today is just
because.  
  
In the warm season, they take a dip in the river, and in other seasons,
they wipe their bodies with towels wrung out with water, but it's still
spring, so a dip in the river would be cold.  
But it's okay! We created a partition with rocks by the river, and if I
jam my antler spear in and put some "heat" into it, it turns into a bath
in no time. The kids have high physical abilities, so even
three-year-old Sora could carry stones weighing about ten kilograms.
Seriously amazing.  
By the way, when I tried to be lazy and heat it up with my "Dragon's
Breath," it instantly turned into super-high-temperature steam, and I
was scolded by the children who were staying far away.  
  
"Ahaha, Aki's embarrassed because Tsubaki-oneechan is here."  
Rin told me this with a chuckle.  
Whenever we take a bath in the river, everyone just steps away from each
other and washes naked, but I'm supposed to be around mid-teens, so Aki
seemed embarrassed.  
Well, Aki was glancing at Rin too, though. Fufu.  
  
"Kyahaha!"  
"Yay!"  
As expected, Hina and Sora were clinging to me because they found my
tail unusual. When I lifted them up while they were grabbing onto my
tail, they were very happy.  
"You two, wash your bodies before the water gets cold~."  
"Yes~."  
"Okay!"  
After bringing my tail around to the front and capturing Hina and Sora,
Rin and I scrubbed them with towels.  
We're using soap too, by the way. The half-used ones and liquid shampoos
left on the street were a weird color, but the soap that was properly
wrapped in plastic was still usable.  
When people evacuated ten years ago, the stores showed signs of having
been ransacked, but the soap was left in the convenience store
warehouses.  
We're using the fancy stuff that seems like it'll leave your skin
moisturized, not the cheap stuff, so we're washing our heads and bodies
thoroughly.  
Since this is for children, it's not a problem to wash them thoroughly
with a lot of oil, but it would be difficult for adults who have less
oil in their hair.  
I'm totally fine. My skin is scales, so I just need to get the surface
dirt off, and my hair doesn't get frizzy.  
My body is strange... My hair might not be "hair." Maybe it's part of my
scales, because it doesn't grow past a certain length, it doesn't burn
in fire, and it grows back if it's cut.  
I cut the kids' hair these past five weeks, and when Rin asked if she
should cut mine too, she couldn’t cut it with scissors, and she looked
at me like she wanted to say something.  
"............"  
It’s been one week since I met that old man... I guess it's about time
for me to leave.  
I gazed aimlessly in the direction of the settlement and secretly sighed
at the fact that I ended up not being able to tell the kids...Rin about
it after all.  
  
  
  
"…Is everyone ready?"  
When the leader of the settlement called out, several of the twenty-two
men and women responded in various ways.  
Some with hopeful and spirited voices, some with exhaustion, some with
regret, and some didn’t respond at all.  
There were few women in this settlement. It was originally a prison, so
it’s only natural, but it became a settlement for those who were injured
and sick who were unable to move quickly and were unable to escape in
time.  
Among them, young women such as students and those in their twenties
didn’t stick around, but gradually headed south to the evacuation center
ten years ago. Even the women who were injured and couldn’t move ended
up leaving within a few years with other young people, heading south.  
The women who remained here were the elderly, couples with small
children, and… women who had children while they were here; there are
only six of them left.  
At that time, they believed that the government would come to rescue
them, and aimed to survive here until then, and they felt hope because
decent prisoners remained as a labor force.  
However… that all changed when new refugees arrived.  
  
About five years later, two refugees appeared in the area.  
They were a group of former university students. About ten of them were
caught in the world-altering event while hiking, and they couldn’t join
the government’s evacuation. They hid from the giant animals and moved
little by little.  
They hid in mountain huts, survived on preserved food, and sometimes
raided abandoned mountain villages to obtain food and supplies,
gradually making their way south. However, they got sick, and without
medicine, and sometimes encountering giant animals, their companions had
dwindled to just the two who had a lot of mountain climbing
experience.  
After five years, they reached this area, their hair and beards long and
unkempt, their clothes tattered and in terrible condition. The people of
the settlement, who were initially wary of them, sympathized with their
plight and welcomed them into the settlement, and they shed tears of
gratitude for their first decent meal and a safe place to sleep in a
long time.  
After a few weeks, they were able to move properly, and the settlement
welcomed them as a new labor force.  
Without even realizing it was a mistake…  
  
For a few months, they worked diligently, trying to fit into the
settlement. However, they had obtained safety and security, though they
couldn’t live luxuriously, and they gradually couldn’t control their
growing desires. They had lived a life far from ethical considerations
for the past five years, and this caused problems for them.  
They attacked the women of the settlement. It could have been prevented
by anyone, but it was done by Aki and Rin, the new children of the
settlement, who stopped them by beating them half to death with their
bare hands.  
  
What Aki and Rin did was undoubtedly justice. But the problem was that
five- and four-year-old children unhesitatingly committed an act of
"violence," even though it was to save a woman they knew.  
It was no longer a peaceful world where women can walk outside alone
anymore. Children born after the world changed killed living things
casually in order to survive.  
Killing insects, killing fish, killing birds… Even adults can do this
much. They can do it, but the memories of living in a peaceful world
make them hesitate and feel uncomfortable.  
But the children hunted stray dogs for food and laughed with
blood-smeared faces that they've obtained food.  
Adults began to fear the children who hunted stray dogs, who could kill
even adults, with their physical abilities and their different sense of
ethics.  
And… the children punished the bad guys as if it was only natural.  
  
Aki and Rin weren’t wrong. What was wrong was that the adults were
desperately clinging to the ethical values of a peaceful world, which
are only a hindrance to living in this post-apocalyptic world.  
But the leader of the settlement had to make a decision. The mothers who
had given birth to a different "new human (monster)" were mentally ill
from the fact that they loved their children but also found them
grotesque, and the women who were pregnant with Riku and Sora at the
time trembled with fear.  
In a peaceful era, love could have won out, but the women had their
minds worn down from their lives thus far, and were completely exhausted
in both body and spirit.  
Rin was the leader's child. That’s why he had no choice but to take the
option of "abandoning" Aki and Rin.  
  
(…Rin)  
The people of the settlement are departing for a new land today.  
The leader recalled the sad, but understanding and resigned face of his
daughter when he left her in the forest.  
Rin understood that she was being abandoned. And yet, instead of crying
and screaming, she naturally accepted it. The leader was afraid of her
high intelligence and strong mental fortitude, but also relieved, and
said farewell to his beloved daughter.  
After abandoning Aki and Rin, they realized that Hina, Riku, and Sora
were "the same" as them, and they were cast out when they turned two.  
Even so, the children survived. The two-year-old infants were also
picked up and raised by the two.  
Unlike the adults, who were exhausted just by living, the children, who
were "new humans (monsters)" adapted to this world, were surviving
vigorously.  
Then, a new "monster" appeared. A genuine new breed of human with horns
and a tail like a dragon, exuding an aura that was several times more
frightening than the "fear" felt from the children.  
When he went to check on them once, he happened to see the girl lifting
a large tree with ease, and he was terrified, thinking that she was even
more of a monster than the children.  
The leader thought that That was how the children would end up. Feeling
that he shouldn't let her come into contact with the women whose hearts
were ill, he decided to leave this place before the monsters turned into
even greater monsters.  
  
The adults were getting into the transport vehicle and truck that they
borrowed from the police station and maintained, along with their
luggage.  
The fuel had been collected from abandoned cars little by little for the
day when this would happen, but he was relieved that the fuel that was
ten years old still worked properly.  
What he told the girl with the horns and tail wasn’t a lie. But he was
hiding a certain truth.  
The herd of giant horses that patrol this area as their territory would
be returning in just a few weeks, not sometime in the future. If they,
who had set traps for the giant horses and used them for food,
disappear, the blame might fall on the children.  
The leader wanted to see his daughter one last time. But, he knew that
he had no right to see her, since he was going to abandon her once
again, using her as a “decoy” to prevent them from chasing him. He
gripped the steering wheel so tightly that his hands turned white.  
"…Depart!"  
  
  
  
***"…Brrrruuu"***  
In the grassland, dozens of kilometers away from the former prison,
there was a herd of giant horses, each five meters tall.  
The horses were racehorses that had been raised on a farm. On that day
ten years ago, the world changed, and the horses gained high
intelligence by growing giant. They understood that humans' *raising*
them was *domination*, and so they rebelled against the humans.  
They were forced to run as long as they lived. They were kept alive only
for breeding, and were killed at the slightest injury.  
For the horses, humans were their *rulers* and *predators*.  
  
Horses were naturally very timid creatures. But by becoming more
intelligent, the horses learned the meaning and meaninglessness of being
afraid, and they became cunning and turned into cruel beings by as much
as they had been scared.  
The small weapons of mankind were not enough to kill them. The large
cylinders that spewed fire couldn’t even aim at the horses running at
full speed.  
Humans were no longer the enemy. They crushed steel boxes with a single
kick. They were sometimes attacked by bears and other giant creatures,
but they ran so fast that they couldn’t catch up, and they came to think
of themselves as very noble beings.  
  
But a few clever humans had survived in this land.  
A small number of humans is no longer a significant threat, but those
humans burned the grassland that the horses ate and began to plant
plants that the horses didn’t like.  
They trampled it several times and turned it into wasteland, and
sometimes they attacked the high walls surrounding the humans’ dwellings
to intimidate them, but while the horses were moving to other areas in
search of grassland, the humans stubbornly burned the grassland again
and planted plants for their own food.  
Once, a young individual reached the limit of its patience and jumped
over the high fence and attacked the humans’ dwelling, but the clever
humans were waiting with a trap of logs with stakes upside down in a
place where the horses could easily jump over.  
As a result, one of their comrades was unable to escape and was burned
to death and eaten by the humans.  
They were about to reach the limit of their patience. They had retreated
with caution at that time, but the horses were now planning to get
revenge on the humans by luring other giant animals that weren’t in a
hostile relationship with them and sending them to attack.  
  
That existence ate the same plants as they did, but instead of eating
the grass growing on the ground, it uprooted and ate entire trees.  
Like the horses, it patrolled in search of food, and the area it passed
through became grassland. It was a useful existence for the horses as
well, and they had a symbiotic relationship with it by guiding it to
places with trees that it liked more than before.  
This time, they’ll take advantage of it. It’s highly intelligent, so it
won’t get angry over something like that… the horse, who was
particularly large among the horses, twisted its mouth as if sneering.  
Now, let’s begin… the annihilation of the humans.  
The horse turned around to look at "him," who was as huge as a mountain
behind it, as if telling him that.  
  
***"…PAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!"***
