# 51 The Children's Way Of Survival (10)

"――――――――――――――――――!!"  
Before the fleeing adults and the giant horse trampling them, I
unleashed a "Dragon's Roar".  
Some of the humans raised their faces as if repelled, and more than half
of them fainted, unable to withstand the "selection."  
But even those who didn't faint didn't necessarily survive the
"selection." They just couldn't faint, and their eyes, filled with
terror and losing their minds, were turned towards "me."  
But even if that scars them, it's better than dying. The eight giant
horses that remained withstood my "selection," and instead of being
terrified, they were wary of the sudden appearance of an "enemy" to all
giant animals, paying no attention to the humans.  
That's right. Your opponent isn't fragile humans.  
It's this "Dragon (Me)."  
  
***"BwohbooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
One of the particularly large giant horses neighed, and as if that
individual was the boss, the remaining horses kicked off the ground all
at once and charged.  
It was like a tsunami... The herd, rushing forward as if to crush
everything, could crush even tanks and armies. But that's why I stomped
on the ground with both feet and raised my voice as if to cut through
the tsunami.  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
A flash. My voice turned into "heat," and the scorching flash of light
released from my mouth sliced through the two horses at the front and
disappeared into the sky.  
It consumes stamina, but by using a big move at the beginning, the other
horses, affected by the aftershock, stopped for a moment as if
frightened.  
"Taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"  
In that instant, I jumped and put "heat" into my arm, stabbing the
red-hot spear into one of the horses in front of me.  
  
***"BrulruooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
But at that moment, the boss horse, pushing aside the other horses that
had stopped, approached me as I stood still and kicked me, sending me
flying.  
Dogoonnn!!  
"――!"  
I instantly hurled my spear at it, but the scales on my arm shattered,
and my small body spurted blood as I was blown away for more than ten
meters.  
I rolled on the ground but immediately took a stance. I don't know if I
can win like this...  
With that thought, I glared at the boss horse, and behind it, I saw the
figures of the people who were still conscious, dragging away the
injured and unconscious people.  
The humans were terrified. Of the giant animals attacking them and the
grotesque me fighting against them...  
For a moment, the faces of the children flashed in my mind.  
The older children who accepted their unhappiness and were desperately
trying to live.  
The young children who were smiling without knowing their unhappiness.  
I don't want to take away any more of those children's "happiness." Even
if they don't seek it... I didn't want them to have any regrets when
they become parents in the future.  
That's why――  
"――Huu"  
Chasing the giant horses, crossing the city, running through the deep
forest, fighting without rest, my exhausted body is beginning to hunger
even after eating the liver of the giant horse.  
My vision was dyed red... The "Dragon's" instinct was getting
stronger.  
My consciousness began to change, and everything moving in my eyes
looked like meat.  
Forcing the consciousness that might even prey on "humans" to focus only
on "giant animals" by clenching my teeth, I entrusted myself to instinct
in order to continue fighting.  
My consciousness was dyed red as if it were being swallowed by the
Dragon's instinct.  
"――――――!"  
In order to protect humans, I became a "Dragon" of my own volition.  
  
  
  
It... had a human-like appearance. However, that individual had "horns"
and a "tail."  
Reddish-bronze skin. Silver hair with a reddish hue like a sakura
seashell.  
As if remembering its instincts, it gripped the ground with the claws on
its hands and feet covered in crimson scales, bent its bright red tail
that was as tall as it was, and glared at the herd of giant horses with
reptilian golden eyes.  
  
***"――――――――――――!"***  
The "Dragon" named "Hanatsubaki" roared.  
It wasn't the "Dragon's Roar" that selected those who stood before her,
but it shook the atmosphere and made all living things aware of the
existence of a "predator."  
Thud!!  
Gouging the ground as she kicked off, Hanatsubaki ran across the
field.  
The figure of her running with her thick, elongated tail extended
horizontally and leaning forward was truly that of a "small dragon."  
The horses, which had stopped moving for a moment, started moving all at
once. Even so, Hanatsubaki, who jumped on one of the horses that had
staggered after receiving a blow to the neck, tore apart its neck from
the wound with her claws in that instant, tearing apart the thick muscle
fibers along with the blood vessels with her fangs.  
  
***"Brulruuuuuuuuu!"***  
Seeing that, one of the horses nearby unleashed a front kick to knock
Hanatsubaki down. But――  
――Roar!  
In that instant, Hanatsubaki, turning her blood-stained face towards the
attacker, spewed flames as if mowing them down, and the giant horse that
was caught in it instantly turned into a ball of fire, thrashing about
in agony.  
The other horses retreated slightly at the sight of the terrible state
of their companion. Sensing that, Hanatsubaki jumped out of the giant
horse she was devouring and attacked another horse.  
  
***"BrulruuuuwoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
The giant boss horse roared at the remaining four subordinate horses.  
***"Bruoo!"***  
As if making up its mind, the individual that was being attacked bit
back at Hanatsubaki, pinning Hanatsubaki down with its entire weight.  
As if aiming for that moment, three giant horses surged in. The three
horses didn't kick or help the attacked individual, but jumped in with
their entire weight as if to crush Hanatsubaki.  
The four giant bodies of the horses, five meters tall, crushed the tiny
Hanatsubaki. The small body of Hanatsubaki disappeared, and everyone was
reminded of the image of a small animal being run over by a car.  
The horses' resolve to recognize the existence of a "natural enemy" and
to reliably defeat the enemy for the sake of their companions was
remarkable, but even more terrifying was the boss horse’s leadership
that made them do so without hesitation.  
At that sight, the boss horse distorted its mouth and smiled, just like
a human.  
But――  
  
***"BrulruuwoooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!?!"***  
At that moment, flames erupted from the gap between the overlapping
giant horses.  
Enormous flames that could scorch the heavens rose up, and even then,
the body of one horse shook as it tried desperately to crush her. A
"tail" burst out through its back from the inside, tearing through the
torso and burning it apart. From there, a blood-soaked Hanatsubaki
appeared, devouring a half-cooked heart.  
The blood that had covered her whole body boiled and evaporated due to
the "heat" emitted by Hanatsubaki.  
Hanatsubaki, who kicked and crushed the head of one horse that was still
moving in the fire burning like a bonfire, glared at the boss horse with
the eyes of a dragon hungry for blood.  
  
The natural enemy and predator of giant animals. The only "Dragon" in
this world――.  
Glowing golden eyes. Red crystal fangs and claws protruding with a
cracking sound.  
The moment it lost its reason due to exhaustion and hunger, bared its
“dragon” instincts, and roared, the boss horse dashed sideways, and the
“Dragon” ran in order to pursue it.  
Dogon!  
Bakin!  
***"Brulruuuuuuu!!"***  
"――――――――!!"  
  
The giant horse and the small dragon collided as they galloped across
the ground.  
The boss horse, the only one left, experienced the emotion of
"impatience" for the first time in its life. It couldn't die. It had to
survive as the leader of the herd.  
Its herd was destroyed, but if it returns to the grasslands, there will
still be individuals who are safe. It couldn't die in order to leave
behind its superior bloodline.  
But――  
The small "Dragon" before it won't allow that.  
  
The surviving humans were watching that battle.  
Almost all of the humans had either fainted from the "Dragon's Roar"
released by Hanatsubaki, or were looking at her transformed form with
terrified eyes. Among them, only the leader of the settlement, who was
always responsible for the danger, had withstood the "selection" and was
evacuating the survivors.  
"…………"  
Anyone who saw Hanatsubaki fighting could see that she was a monster.
The way she was taking down the herd of nearly ten giant horses while
covered in blood was more terrifying than any giant animal.  
She wasn't human, but rather a being similar to the giant animals and
children that had appeared since the world had changed, a supernatural
being far superior to them.  
But if she hadn't come, everyone here would have certainly died. There
were a few victims, but the fact that there were survivors was a miracle
in itself.  
The man understood. Hanatsubaki had more of a "human" heart than anyone
else... more than themselves, who abandoned the children as alien
beings. That's why...  
"I..."  
Words failed him. His thoughts were jumbled. The small words that came
to his mind were words that he shouldn't say as a leader, and the man
could only mutter the name of the daughter he had abandoned out of
regret, as if seeking salvation.  
  
In front of such humans, alien beings from the end of the world
collided.  
The small dragon approached from behind the giant horse galloping at
high speed. The boss horse drew her in and unleashed a full-power back
kick.  
This blow had once killed the leader of a giant wolf pack that had
attacked the herd, and although only the white individual was allowed to
escape, it was a deadly blow that had annihilated that pack.  
There was no room to dodge. The boss horse’s mouth twisted into
something like a smile.  
But――  
***"――!?"***  
――Gagagagagagah!  
The deadly kick that should have been impossible to dodge cut through
the air. Unlike giant animals, Hanatsubaki, who was light in weight,
thrust her sharp tail into the ground, killing her inertia while
scraping the asphalt underneath, dodging the kick.  
She wasn't just a violent dragon. She had a human form and
intelligence.  
The gazes of the boss horse, who unleashed the back kick, and
Hanatsubaki, who stopped on the ground, met――  
"――Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
Hanatsubaki's "voice" shouted with "heat," and as if chasing after the
giant horse that tried to dodge it at the last moment, Hanatsubaki, who
turned her face, spewed out all-encompassing "flames."  
***"――――"***  
The flames engulfed the horse’s entire body, and instead of fighting
back, it attempted to flee.  
The boss’ movements, with its entire body burned, were slow. However,
Hanatsubaki's flames, which had consumed "heat" so many times, couldn't
burn it to ashes in an instant.  
A giant horse fleeing. A small dragon that keeps breathing flames.  
Hanatsubaki knelt down as if she had run out of strength, and the flames
disappeared from her mouth... and the boss of the giant horses, who had
been advancing for several meters, collapsed.  
  
"…………"  
Hanatsubaki remained on her knees, staring blankly at the scene for a
while, but then the light of reason returned to her eyes.  
As she looked around in a daze, a man called out to her.  
  
"...I'm sorry. Can we talk?"
