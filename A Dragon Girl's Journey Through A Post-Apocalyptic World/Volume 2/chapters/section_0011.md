# 40 Abandoned Village (2)

"……Here it comes."  
I brandished my antler spear and glared at a corner of the forest
surrounding the village.  
―Thud.  
The ground trembled, echoing from afar. Giant trees cracked and broke,
and a black object slowly emerged from within the forest, rising up on
its hind legs as if to threaten me.  
"A brown bear……"  
Brown bears aren't supposed to be on Honshu, but that giant could
probably cross over from Hokkaido.  
When it was on all fours, it was already close to five meters tall, but
standing up, its height was over ten meters, not inferior to the
surrounding giant trees.  
It had the corpse of a giant deer in its mouth, and upon recognizing me,
the giant bear snapped the giant deer's neck with a gatsun sound,
showing a knowing grin as if to display its high intelligence.  
  
***"GoooaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"***  
  
It bore its fangs at me, shaking the surrounding trees with a single
roar, and small birds flew away all at once from the surrounding
forest.  
"Not good……"  
That giant bear seems to desire me, the small one, more than the large
whole deer.  
The mysterious "power" dwelling in giant creatures.  
Just as I find the raw flesh and liver of creatures with a lot of this
power to be delicious, that giant bear may be seeking the power of the
“Dragon” dwelling in “my” blood.  
Or perhaps it instinctively sees “me” as an enemy.  
  
A brown bear…… the strongest predator not only in this country, but on
Earth.  
But I am the predator of you all…… a "Dragon."  
  
***"――――――――――――――――――――――――――!!"***  
  
I responded to the giant bear, releasing a "Dragon's Roar" into the
night sky, shaking the atmosphere.  
Within the dragon's eyes that light up the darkness of the night, I
could see small birds that have perished and started to fall like rain
due to the "selection" of the roar. Both my arms and legs were covered
in bright red scales up to my biceps and thighs. The scales of my
elongated tail were standing on end like blades, and the four horns
spread slightly as if protecting my head.  
The "heat" emanating from my entire body caused the trampled fallen
leaves to burst into flames. Within the flames, I pointed the scorching
red tip of my antler spear towards the giant bear.  
  
***"……Gaa."***  
Seeing my "transformation," the giant bear, which withstood the
selection of the roar, didn’t retreat, but growled warily, putting its
front paws on the ground and bristled its entire body.  
Shall we decide?  
Which one is the "predator"?  
  
Daan!!!!  
The giant bear's hind legs gouged the earth, and it blew me backward as
if my legs were kicking the ground.  
Coincidentally, it's the same setup as the giant boar battle from
before. But just as I am different from what I was before, the giant
bear also has fangs and claws that serve only for killing enemies.  
Gakin!!  
The giant bear's sideways claw strike repelled my antler spear attack.  
"You!"  
The antler spear wasn’t blown away, but instead I used it to parry while
kicking the ground with one foot and jumping up, rotating my body and
striking the giant bear's face with my tail.  
Bachinn!!  
***"GaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"***  
The tail attack wasn't a big damage dealer. But the tail strike, which
whipped like a lash, caused intense pain, and the giant bear had its
head thrown back.  
"Haa!"  
I jumped out immediately, brandishing my antler spear, and thrust the
spear towards its head. But the giant bear noticed it immediately and
swatted it away with its giant arm.  
It was a split-second decision, and it swatted it away with the back of
its hand without even using its claws, but my body, blown away by the
giant muscles, was sent flying tens of meters and crashed into one of
the ruins, carving into the ground in a straight line.  
  
***"GooaaAAAAAAAA!"***  
I could sense the giant bear sprinting across on the ground, carving
into the earth. It brought down its massive arms and claws onto the
rubble of the ruins where I was buried.  
Dogoon!!  
A large amount of rubble and dust dances around―  
  
"――Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!"  
  
Even while buried in the ruins, I unleashed a flash of "Dragon's Breath"
towards the direction of the "presence."  
Dogaan!!  
But that attack only slightly gouged the giant bear's shoulder as it
dodged at the last moment, and it rolled back.  
……Gadan.  
"……Peh."  
I rose from among the rubble burning from the heat of the Dragon's
Breath, spitting out the dust in my mouth with blood-mixed saliva.  
  
――Pakin……  
My body, which had taken unexpected damage, began to regenerate, and the
scales covering the repaired wounds peeled off and crumbled.  
***"Gaa……"***  
"…………"  
We glared at each other, keeping our distance again.  
I had taken some damage, but the giant bear wasn't unscathed either. But
the problem is that my trump card, the "Dragon's Breath," was dodged.  
The "Dragon's Breath" is something that shoots out "heat" with a shout,
and it takes a few seconds to fire. With that much time, an agile animal
can avoid it, and the giant bear will probably be wary from now on.  
Ugh, geez! I wasted it and lost all my energy!  
  
I increased the heat of my entire body, drawing in heat from the
surrounding burning flames, and clenched the antler spear, which had
become even more reddish.  
***"……Grururu!!"***  
The giant bear, wounded by my appearance, growled with anger. But it was
calm and didn't immediately attack, seeing me as a threat.  
I can also evade long-range attacks, but what will you do? You should
have even fewer options than me, probably only close combat. Just as I
thought that—  
  
***"GoooaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"***  
The giant bear suddenly raised its arm and dug into the ground with its
claws, sending a large amount of rocks flying.  
The huge rocks were crushed by the claws and fired at me like
buckshot.  
"――!"  
Even if they're crushed, if stones larger than a fist come at bullet
speed, even my scales will take heavy damage if I take a few hits.  
I jumped and evaded, using my antler spear as a shield, but several
stones still hit my hands and feet, and I rolled through the rubble,
losing my balance.  
***"GoOO!"***  
Seeing that, the giant bear rushed forward, tearing through the ground,
and brought down its giant claws.  
In a split-second, I threw something that touched my hand within the
rubble at the giant bear's face.  
It would’ve been terrible if it was something different from what I
expected, but as I imagined, the giant bear, who received a sheet of
dust on its face, had its vision blocked, and I thrust the antler spear
there.  
  
"HaaaaAAAAAAAAA!!"  
The tip of the antler spear, filled with "heat," became a scorching red,
piercing the giant bear's neck while burning the sheet of dust. The
bear's claws also tore through the scales on my arm, which I used as a
shield.  
***"GaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"***  
"――!"  
Blood gushed from my arm, and the giant bear cried out in pain as blood
spurted from its neck and the area around the wound burned.  
The giant bear, still not losing its will to fight, rose to stand on two
legs, its eyes glaring at me. I also glared at it, brandishing my antler
spear in my unharmed right hand and leaping out.  
  
***"GoooaaaaaAAAAAAAA!"***  
Dogoon!!  
"――!"  
Suddenly, the ground erupted, kicking me up along with a large amount of
dirt and rubble.  
The previous flying rocks and this front kick shows just how intelligent
the bear is. But――  
"You…… got scared."  
The giant bear tried to create distance between us. It was a troublesome
enemy because it became more intelligent, but as a side effect, its wild
violence decreased, and its survival instincts became stronger.  
You can avoid my long-range attacks. You may have thought that.  
You probably thought that if you created some distance and then ambushed
me with flying rocks again, you could kill me, who only has small claws
and fangs.  
But――  
"My 'fangs' aren't just one!"  
Know well the meaning of being humanoid.  
I poured as much "heat" as I could into the spear held in my right hand
and threw it with all my might, flicking it with my tail.  
  
***"GoooaaaaaAAAAAAAA!!"***  
The scorching hot spear, exceeding the speed of sound, pierced through
the back of the giant bear's hand, which it used as a shield at the last
moment, and pierced its throat.  
Flames overflowed from the deeply embedded spear, blocking the vision of
the bear whose face was scorched by the fire.  
As I ran through the air by kicking off the recoil of my tail and the
flying rubble, I latched onto the bear, using the embedded spear as a
foothold.  
This is the end!  
  
"――Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!"  
  
"Dragon's Breath" exhaled from point-blank range――the scorching flames
burned the giant bear's face and spread around it.  
The flames enveloped the entire village as if guided by something,
turning the area I had dug up into a sea of flames.  
――Gishi.  
In the flames that even evaporate the moisture in the eyeballs and burn
even inside the lungs, the giant bear's arm moved slightly.  
"HaaaaaAAAAAAAA!!"  
I grabbed the spear that I had been using as a foothold and, with the
red-hot spear, slashed the giant bear from its throat to below its
chest, burning it all the way to the bottom.  
Jushaaaaaaa!!  
The gushing blood evaporated on the spot. I thrust the spear into the
wound, and, using it as a lever, kicked the spear with my heel to gouge
out its heart.  
  
――Dodooon!  
The giant bear collapsed backwards into the flames. I raised the giant
heart pierced with the antler spear above it, and shouted at the night
sky.  
"I wonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"  
  
As I collapsed onto my back, I felt like I saw several souls rising into
the night sky illuminated by the flames of the burning village.
