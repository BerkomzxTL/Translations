# 33 Tempted Off Course

Fuuh!  
  
"......This is troublesome."  
The orange tabby cat was still wary and growling, but she can't move
because she's pregnant.  
I don't intend to get involved in the life or death of wild animals...or
rather, maybe it would be better to say, stray cats.  
She doesn't look like she's lived for more than ten years, so she hasn't
had any interactions with people like Jinbei, and there's no need to get
attached...  
"......Ah, geez."  
I can't abandon her now that I've realized she's pregnant.  
Besides, if the crows are targeting this cat, or rather, her kittens,
it's even harder to abandon her. Even those crows need to get food, so
interfering might be wrong, but...  
"Those guys are annoying."  
I haven't forgotten being attacked as a prank!  
  
I've come up with various reasons, but isn't it okay to just say I want
to see the kittens?  
The orange tabby cat probably won't get used to me, but I'll try to help
her a little.  
I took a spot a little away from the kitty in the same building, made a
fence with broken desks and furniture, and put my luggage there. Then I
took the milk pot, filled it with the remaining clean snow, and infused
it with "heat" to melt the snow.  
"It's hot..."  
I put the steaming milk pot on the snow to forcibly cool it down.  
  
――Caw――  
  
"Don't bother us, okay?"  
When I infused my breath with "heat" and blew upwards, the wind stirred
up by the temperature difference, making the crows fly away in a hurry.
Still, are they still targeting the kitty? A few of them were perched on
the roof of a nearby ruin to watch what’s happening.  
Are crows really that vindictive...? But it doesn't feel like revenge.  
"......Hmm?"  
As I was waiting for the hot water to cool, a grayish-brown lump caught
my eye.  
I probably wouldn't have noticed it if it were the season when grass
grows. I approached it, and it was neither soil nor rubble, but
something visible between the snow...  
"......A cat."  
It was the remains of a cat. Maybe it was that kitty's partner? It's
covered in wounds and peck marks, so maybe it was trying to gather food
for that kitty and was attacked by crows.  
"......If there were two of you, you wouldn't have lost, you know."  
  
Maybe the reason I don't see strong emotions like revenge from the crows
is because they've already taken revenge. At the same time, I realized
that the cat and the crows are in a clear state of hostility. That's why
the crows might be planning to attack the kittens when they're born.  
...It's really a problem when they're so intelligent.  
I took out my claws, dug up the base of a tree, and buried the tattered
cat corpse.  
This is just my self-satisfaction. I didn't have to do it, but there was
no reason not to. Maybe it's because it reminded me of Granny somehow.  
  
I brought the lukewarm water back to the building and poured it into a
plastic tray that looked like it was for holding documents, placing it a
little away from the kitty, who was still wary of me.  
You're probably not getting enough to drink, right? You can drink it, or
you can be wary and not drink it. I don't intend to force you to, I'm
just going to help you a little.  
"I guess I'll start preparing dinner."  
I just ate a lot of raw meat, so I'm not very hungry, so something light
will do.  
I gathered branches that had fallen at the base of the trees growing in
the ruins, placed them in the center of a pile of rubble, started a
fire, took out a diced piece of crocodile wrapped in leaves, and
skewered it on the tip of my antler spear to roast it over the fire.  
It'll probably take quite a while for it to cook through, but I don't
mind taking my time. I carefully cooked it so it didn’t burn, and when
the fat started to rise and drip, I shaved off the cooked part of the
meat with my tusk knife and put it straight into my mouth.  
"Hmm, it's just normal meat."  
  
It seems that cooking it removes the strange power and turns it into
normal meat.  
But as I thought, the fibers are thick and it was rather bland. Even so,
I felt a definite umami and strong nourishment within the wild, gamey
smell. Well, I prefer it raw though.  
I continued to cook and shave off pieces. Even a ten-centimeter cube got
eaten up pretty quickly. I finely shaved the remaining part, collected
it in another tray, and placed it next to the water.  
  
Fuu~!  
  
"Okay, okay, I'm going over there~"  
I waved my tail instead of my hand, returned to my territory, added more
branches to the campfire, and then lay down to sleep.  
  
"......Fuwa~a"  
The next morning, I woke up with the sunrise and stretched my back.  
I brushed off the fallen leaves on my head and looked around with sleepy
eyes, but since I was positioned near the entrance, it didn't seem like
any crows had come.  
This building seems to have been a company. There are office desks and
document trays, but nothing else of note, so I'll go around to check out
some nearby restaurants.  
With the level of disrepair, I don't think there's any proper food left,
but there's one more thing I want.  
"......This looks good."  
What I found in the ruined restaurant was a stockpot. It's not for
cooking. Going to the river to bathe is a bit of a long trip, so I
thought I'd collect snow from around here to secure water.  
There was also a new towel still wrapped in plastic, so I took it to
wipe my body.  
  
When I returned to the building and took a quick peek at where the kitty
was, the meat I had left last night was gone. I wonder if she drank the
water too? The kitty was still wary of me as I refilled the tray with
water and picked up the empty tray, but she didn't growl.  
She's gotten used to me......I don't think so, but maybe the scent of
that cat was still there.  
  
Then I went outside and explored, preparing a meal while chasing away
the crows that were bothering me.  
Today, I'll cook. I pried open a can of foreign-made tomatoes with my
tusk knife and mashed them up to some extent.  
I put the crocodile fat I had saved into the milk pot to let the fat
seep out, added dried garlic I found at the Italian restaurant, and when
the aroma came out, I added the crushed tomatoes and simmered them
slowly.  
I don't care if the fat splatters a little. I won't get burned by that
much. I added dried basil and whatever else I had, and seasoned it with
salt......  
  
Minyaa~aaaa――  
  
"Ah, sorry, was it smelly?"  
Was the garlic bad...? The crows seem to be getting noisy from the smell
too.  
While further crushing the tomatoes, I put the bite-sized pieces of
crocodile meat in and simmered them. Should I have stir-fried the meat
first? Well, there's nothing I can do about it now.  
Is it about time...? I poked the meat with a wooden branch instead of
chopsticks, and it's become quite soft, so now it's time to eat.  
"......Hm! It's okay."  
It was a bit haphazard, but the stewed crocodile meat in tomato sauce
was edible. I feel like it would be even tastier if I used olive oil or
something, but the thing I found was colored in a way that made me
think, *That's no good*, so I gave up.  
I lightly rinsed the last large chunk of meat with water to wash away
the tomatoes, and then split it into small pieces with my tusk knife.  
If I remove the flavor this much, you should be able to eat it.  
"I'll leave it here~"  
When I put the meat on a plastic tray and left it again, the kitty still
stared intently at me, seeming wary.  
After continuing that kind of life for a few days――  
  
―Mew―  
  
"――Haa"  
I was sleeping in my territory when I was woken up by a faint cry.  
It was still the middle of the night, but I jumped up and peeked in
secret, and I saw the kitty licking her kittens.  
I'm glad......They seem to have been born safely. I can't see them well
from here, but are there three of them? I see, if you had that many in
your belly, you wouldn't be able to move.  
This is good. I really want to watch over them for a few more days, but
I won't get more involved than this.  
But...  
"I guess it'll be okay for at least the last meal."  
  
The next morning, I took out two chunks of crocodile meat and cut them
into small pieces. I put them in the milk pot and boiled them in water,
and while I was doing that, I tasted edible wild grasses and tree buds,
chopped up only the new buds and added a small amount, just a little
salt, and simmered them slowly until the water was gone.  
The flavor would be better if I could catch some shellfish from the
river, but oh well. After simmering it for about two hours until it was
tender, I chopped it up even finer, put it on a tray, and fanned it to
cool it down...  
  
――Mew――  
  
"Eh......?"  
A small kitten was crying at my feet while I was sitting down and
concentrating on my work.  
Huh? Eh? Why? You were just born, right? It's only about ten meters
away, but you came all the way here? Even though your eyes aren't open
yet?  
"You're an amazing kitty..."  
  
――Mew――  
  
A tiny kitten that fit in the palm of my hand. Whether it was drawn in
by the smell or seeking warmth, it was moving restlessly on my hand and
meowing.  
I had no choice. I took the kitten in my hand and carried it to the
mother kitty with the still-slightly-warm meat tray. The kitty glanced
at me and the kitten, but didn't make a sound and just took the kitten
from my hand.  
The kitty was licking the runaway kitten and grooming it, looking
somewhat annoyed. I gently placed the meat tray next to her and turned
my back when――  
  
Nyaa\~\~\~\~~.  
  
"Hmm? Is it okay?"  
That's somehow what I felt like I was being told. As I sat down next to
her, the kitty started eating the meat as if nothing had happened, and
after finishing half of it in an instant, she started breastfeeding her
kittens.  
I wonder what it is...... She was so wary at first.  
I wasn't scolded when I held the kitten that was sleeping after drinking
milk, so maybe I've been recognized as a friend.  
"......Huh?"  
I found something strange in the place where the kitty was sleeping.
There was a handkerchief, a leather wallet, and other things that seemed
to have been gathered to be used as bedding, and in that bedding, there
was a palm-sized machine wrapped in a leather cover.  
"......A portable radio?"  
I thought it was a calculator at first, but when I looked closely, it
wasn't. Maybe it's for emergencies? That's what I thought, because it
had a solar panel like a calculator.  
I think the battery is dead, but just to be sure, I put it in a sunny
place while petting the kitten, and then I heard a faint sound,
*...jiji...*.  
The radio wasn’t broken yet. I frantically messed with the frequency,
but it didn’t connect to anything, and it quickly ran out of power and
went silent.  
Oh well...... I'll take it for now.  
I returned the kitten to the kitty and prepared to leave this place.  
"Well, I'm leaving soon, so take care."  
  
Nyaa.  
  
Just to be safe, I left about three chunks of crocodile meat that I had
slowly cooked over the past few days, and the kitty meowed once to see
me off as I left the tray of water in a place where the rain seemed
likely to blow in.  
...I think she understood that I wasn't coming back. The giant creatures
have increased intelligence, but maybe ordinary animals also have
slightly increased intelligence. Now then...  
"...You guys are pretty persistent."  
  
――Caw!  
  
The crows, having noticed that the kittens had been born, had gathered
around the building.  
More than ten of them...... It seems like all the crows in this area
have gathered, and they've even built nests in nearby trees.  
I'm done with just lightly chasing them away.  
My pupils narrowed vertically so that my vision brightened, and the skin
on my arms and legs rippled and became covered in bright red scales with
a crackling sound.  
As a "heat" in my body rose, the remaining snow around me turned to
steam. I glared at the crows and unleashed my "presence" on them.  
"Begone."  
  
――Cawwwwwwww――  
  
The crows, who received my "Dragon Presence," all took off at once,
colliding with each other in a panic as they flew towards the
mountains.  
......Did I scare them a little too much? I hope they don't come back
until at least the kittens are grown.  
Just in case, I scratched several giant trees with my claws to assert my
territory.  
At that moment―  
〈…………jiji……〉  
The radio in my belongings made a faint noise. It seems that the sun was
shining through the gaps in the luggage, and it made a noise at a
randomly tuned frequency.  
I was going to turn off the switch because it was annoying, but the
noise coming from the radio changed to "sound."  
  
〈……jiji……anyone…………radiotower……jiji……anyone……〉  
  
"Is anyone......there?"  
Radiotower? I climbed a tree and looked around, and saw a red tower that
looked like one in the mountains. It might be a different one from that
though...  
"I'll go there for now......"  
It might be a detour, but maybe I'll find someone there.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
――Caw――  
  
The crows were indignant. A safe place where the giant monsters wouldn't
come. They had fought with small four-legged creatures to make that
their territory.  
No one in the sky could rival them. But that small four-legged creature
had taken a position in a place where they couldn't flap their wings,
and their comrades who had tried to attack it by force had been
killed.  
They would never forgive the one who killed their comrade. That's what
they decided, but those four-legged creatures were always acting in
pairs, and that opportunity didn't come easily.  
But then, it started acting alone. If it were to enter a bad place, even
a single one could turn the tables. The crows gathered their comrades
and killed that one by attacking in a group.  
But that wasn't enough to quell their anger. The crows, noticing that
the other one was pregnant, surrounded it, intending to eat its children
in front of its eyes, and began to interfere with it getting food.  
There was no meaning to that action.  
It was just the emotion of "pleasure" that the crows had felt for the
first time since being born into this world.  
  
But then a "two-legged" creature appeared. It was bigger than them, but
it shouldn't be able to beat them in the sky. The crows had taken it
lightly, thinking that it was just a stupid animal that couldn't put up
any decent resistance, even though they had tried to bother it several
times.  
However, they were wrong. That wasn't a "creature" that could be
categorized like that.  
It was different from them and the four-legged animals. It was different
from that giant creature. They were forced to understand with one glare
that it was a "monster" with a fundamentally different existence from
this world, and they had to run away.  
Even so, the crows hadn't given up. They were the kings of the sky. Not
even that giant creature could lay a hand on them.  
They decided to gather more comrades and get revenge for sure, and as
they approached a large rock in the mountains in search of a new
nest――  
  
Basaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!  
  
The giant "rock" spread its "wings" and took flight, and the crows, who
were caught in the wind that was stirred up, were torn apart by its
claws and swallowed whole by its giant beak.  
That huge bird――a giant Andean condor――devoured the noisy crows and flew
leisurely into the sky in search of its next prey.
