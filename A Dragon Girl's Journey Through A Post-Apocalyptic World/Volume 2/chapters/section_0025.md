# 54 The Children's Way Of Survival (13)

Some time after Hanatsubaki started chasing after the giant elephant—  
  
"Can't you go any faster?!"  
"There's no way I can on a road like this!"  
Two former university students who set off fireworks and foisted the
danger onto others, along with a few men who, though passively, affirmed
that act, were driving a truck on a buried national highway.  
They were yelling at each other, but the expressions of the two former
university students were bright.  
They were thrilled to have finally escaped the small, unfulfilling
settlement, but also because they had used their quick wits in a
critical situation and outsmarted the others with the fireworks they had
prepared, like children who had succeeded in a prank.  
  
They had been that desperate. They had felt that much of a life-or-death
crisis.  
Deep within their mental state was "fear."  
The terror of the animals they had previously controlled as livestock
growing gigantic and attacking. And the monster of a woman who killed
and devoured the giant animals that crushed humans like insects.  
At first, when they heard the bespectacled man talking, they thought
that if she was a young woman with horns and a tail, it wouldn't be so
bad... influenced by anime and manga, they thought so without giving it
much thought.  
But "reality" was different... The girl with horns and a tail, and
scales all over her body, like a "dragon," was a "monster" more
terrifying than any giant creature.  
Few can endure being near an overwhelming "predator."  
That's why, by outsmarting her, the men who had been liberated from the
life-threatening situation secreted large amounts of endorphins in their
brains and continued to frolic like children.  
  
"Don't you guys look so glum!"  
"That's right, if we can get to a proper shelter, there will be lots of
women there!"  
When the two former uni9versity students, who were making a ruckus in
the driver's and passenger's seats, called out to the men in the truck
bed, the other men, who had been feeling a little guilty, seemed to have
shaken it off, and they smiled, thinking of an unfamiliar land.  
A new life would begin. They would return from that crappy life with no
entertainment to the original world where everything was available.  
Humans have armies and weapons. If they went south, there would surely
be large cities remaining, and they would be able to return to a life
where they could get anything they wanted, just like in the old days.
Drunk on the chemicals in their brains, the men dreamed of a wonderful
new life.  
But—  
Could humans really win?  
  
Dogoooooon!!  
"――――――――――――!?"  
The truck, which had been moving slowly, was suddenly hit from the side
by a strong impact and sent flying. The men riding in the truck bed were
thrown out without even being able to scream.  
"—Hic"  
Dosha!  
A shadow fell over one of the men who had been thrown out and was lying
on the ground from the impact, and a giant foot crushed the face of the
man who looked up at it in terror.  
Don! Don!  
The giant shadow trampled on the men who were still unable to move, one
after another.  
  
"...Ugh...Ah"  
The two former university students who had been in the driver's and
passenger's seats of the overturned truck groaned in pain with blood
flowing from their foreheads, and their faces turned blue at the smell
of gasoline wafting in the air.  
They had to escape. But whether something was stuck or a bone was
broken, their arms and legs would not move properly, and then a giant
shadow fell. The two saw the eyes of hatred directed at them from a
"giant horse" with its entire body burned, staring at them through the
broken windshield.  
"—Hel"  
—Zudoooooon!!  
  
The giant horse crushed the two men along with the driver's seat. Again
and again—it trampled them over and over, as if venting its hatred for
humans, and then neighed loudly, as if exhaling roughly.  
The leader of the giant horses was still alive, even though its entire
body had been burned. Thick skin and fat protected its brain and
internal organs, and its burned skin was gradually beginning to heal
like a scab falling off.  
***“Brururuu…”***  
It couldn't defeat that "dragon." But it had eliminated the damned
humans who had attracted it.  
It had lost all of its comrades, but the herd of giant horses was not
just them. The leader of the giant horses set off for a new land to
create a new herd, and it galloped off somewhere without even looking
back at the truck that exploded as if to cremate the humans.  
<br />  
<br />
"Tsubaki... nee-chan?"  
The giant elephant was suddenly attacked and collapsed. Aki let out a
hoarse voice as a "monster" appeared from within it, flames shooting
up.  
She had suddenly appeared before the children one day. A slightly older
girl with copper-colored skin that they had never seen before, and horns
and a tail that shouldn't exist.  
The moment Aki and Rin saw her, they understood without a doubt that she
was different from the "adults," and that she belonged to this same
"world" as them.  
So they called out to her without hesitation and introduced her to the
younger children as well. Hina, Riku, and Sora also weren't shy around
her, and took an immediate liking to her with her horns and tail.  
  
When it was just Aki and Rin, it was a teenage girl wearing what looked
like a "sailor uniform" who taught the two young children how to
survive. She was cheerful, but somewhat unapproachable, and the two of
them never really warmed up to her, and before they knew it, she had
disappeared without saying anything to the two who had finally learned
to live.  
Hanatsubaki was completely different from that person.  
While having non-human characteristics, she cherished and protected the
children more than anyone else. Aki and Rin also realized that
Hanatsubaki would leave someday, like "that person," but they came to
rely on her protection.  
But...  
  
"..."  
When Aki saw Hanatsubaki's figure after defeating the giant elephant, he
understood the reason why she was so "kind."  
With more than half of her bloody body covered in bright red scales, she
flexed her long tail, bared her fangs, and opened her reptilian eyes
wide while wreathed in flames. She was far from human.  
The children had been abandoned by the adults because they were *too
strong*.  
Because they had somehow "understood" this, they easily gave up on
seeking the protection of the weak adults and were somewhat accepting of
being abandoned.  
It was the same.  
Hanatsubaki was kind to the "weak" children relatively because she was
far *stronger* than that.  
That's why she could also go to help the "weaker" adults.  
Aki realized Hanatsubaki was "kind," just like when Sora had taken in a
baby squirrel she had found in the forest and then returned it once it
had recovered.  
Hanatsubaki liked the children.  
But was that the same feeling as *family*—?  
  
The moment he thought that, Aki hesitated to interact with Hanatsubaki,
who had a frightening appearance, as innocently as before. When he
looked at Rin with just his eyes, she also seemed to be hesitating
somewhere.  
The little ones were the same. They didn’t know what to do with the
different form of "Her" that they had previously known... with her
existence as a transcendent being.  
  
At that moment... the eyes of the "dragon," which had been wide open
like those of a wild beast, wavered and returned to normal in an
instant. Hanatsubaki noticed the children hesitating to approach her and
smiled sadly.  
"...Is everyone, alright?"  
Her voice was hoarse, like the growl of a carnivorous beast, perhaps
because she had breathed fire so many times. As she said that,
Hanatsubaki landed on the ground... but still kept a little distance
from the children.  
"Y, yeah"  
"I see. That's good... The adults are all safe, though not all of them.
I think Aki's parents are alive."  
"Ah, ...yeah"  
He needed to say something, but he was at a loss for words. But if
things continued like this, Hanatsubaki would go away while these
feelings still weighed on his mind.  
But then—  
  
"—Chiibaki!"  
A young voice rang out, and Sora, who had jumped out of Rin's hand, dove
right at Tsubaki's feet.  
"Sora, ...you'll get dirty, you know?"  
"Nn-uh!"  
Sora hugged Hanatsubaki even tighter, who was trying to dissuade her
from getting dirty.  
"Because... Chubaki did her best!"  
Aki and Rin were startled by Sora's shout.  
That's right. No matter how strong Hanatsubaki was, it must have taken a
lot of courage to fight that giant elephant. As proof, Hanatsubaki's
tattered body had numerous scars and missing and chipped scales.  
As Sora said, it was because Hanatsubaki had *tried her best* that the
adults who were connected to the children were safe, and the children's
lives were also safe.  
It was because Hanatsubaki had fought those terrifying giant creatures
for the sake of the children.  
  
"...Thank you, Tsubaki nee-chan!"  
"Tsubaki-oneechan!"  
"Thank you!"  
"Thank you!"  
Hanatsubaki's face bloomed like a flower at the children's words of
thanks one after another.  
But... Hanatsubaki stopped the children who were about to run up to her
by raising her hand. She gently pushed Sora, who had been clinging to
her, towards the rest of the group.  
"Nee-chan...?"  
"The adults are coming back. It's better if I'm not here."  
"Why?!"  
Aki shouted. Everyone else must have felt the same way.  
"The adults were afraid of me. You understand that feeling a little,
right?"  
"That's..."  
Certainly, even the children had been taken aback, so it was
understandable that the adults, who were just ordinary humans, were
afraid.  
"That doesn't matter! Even if those people come back..."  
"But it's better to leave room for reconciliation, Rin. ...He's your
father, right?"  
"...That's"  
Rin bit her lip, unable to say anything to Hanatsubaki's words.  
"There are rice seeds in my belongings, so use them. I think Rin can
grow them after reading the book."  
"Okay..."  
"This isn't the end. We can meet again when everyone grows up."  
"Chubaki!"  
Aki restrained Sora as she was about the jump out again.  
Aki also understood that the situation with the adults couldn't continue
as it was. He couldn't turn a blind eye to Hanatsubaki's kindness in
giving Rin this opportunity.  
  
"Nee-chan... I... no, we, everyone will get along. And when we grow up,
we'll all go on a journey! Like nee-chan!"  
"Yeah! I'll definitely go see you! Onee-chan!"  
"Me too!"  
"I will too!"  
"Chuba!"  
Hanatsubaki smiled with her whole face, still covered in blood, at the
children who said so one after another. Then she started running and
spread her wings wide.  
"See you later! We'll definitely meet again!"  
Hanatsubaki spewed flames from her wings and soared into the sky. The
children watched her for a long time as she disappeared, leaving a
contrail behind.  
  
  
Flying through the sky with bright red wings, I...  
"...Uwaaaaaaaaaaa!"  
Clutched my head while spiraling in the air.  
It turned into a heartfelt story, so I just left in the heat of the
moment! But...  
"I'm lonely!"  
All I have are my fur clothes, antler spear, and tusk knife. I left
everything else behind, but I don't regret it... not much, anyway.  
More than anything, I’m just feeling overwhelmingly lonely. Even though
I was only with them for about a month, I enjoyed living with the
children, perhaps because I had been alone for so long.  
I had been alone all this time. The faces of the two people I had met
along the way came to mind. Granny had gone to where Gramps and the
others were.  
But, the other one...  
"I wonder if I should go see him... Jinbei."
