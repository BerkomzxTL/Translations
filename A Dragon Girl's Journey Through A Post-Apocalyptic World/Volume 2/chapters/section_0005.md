# 34 Radio Tower

"......It's quite far."  
The radio caught a mysterious signal, and I set off for the nearest
"radio tower," which was the only clue, but even after a full day, I
still hadn't arrived.  
It's in sight, so it shouldn't be that far...  
Humans built and managed it, so there should be roads for cars, but in
the last ten years, the plants have grown rapidly, some of the trees
have become huge, the protruding roots have broken the roads, a large
amount of fallen leaves have piled up and become soil. Plants have
grown, and the roads, signs, and guardrails are all covered.  
  
"Is this a road?"  
A sign that was almost swallowed by the trees barely told me that it was
a road.  
I had hoped this road would lead to the radio tower, but sometimes it
doesn't. The reason I can't get there is because I keep getting lost.  
I’ve been occasionally climbing trees to check the direction, but when I
get down and start walking, I can't see anything because of the huge
trees, so most of the time I get lost.  
"This is a problem..."  
If I pick berries, I can barely manage food, but not being able to
replenish water is tough. There's still snow left, so I can melt it into
water, but there are a lot of trees around here, so there's not much
snow, and it's likely to become muddy water...  
"...Hmm?"  
  
As I looked around, I saw a vibrant green color in the gaps between the
trees.  
The leaves of the trees were also green, but the area underneath the
giant trees didn't get any sunlight and was quite dark, but only that
area had a vivid green that seemed to be bathed in sunlight.  
Feeling somehow drawn to it, I headed there...  
"A bamboo grove, huh?"  
It was a bamboo grove with many large bamboo trees growing there.  
...Ah, that's right. Something in my "knowledge" caught my attention, so
I'll look into it.  
I wonder if young bamboo is better? I shook them, tapped them to check
the sound, and tried various things, but I couldn't find what I was
looking for.  
"That's strange... I think there should be one."  
Is the information in my knowledge incomplete, or is there a procedure,
or is the timing bad?  
Although it's spring, when I look closely, there's hardly any young
bamboo, so it might still be a little early for the plants to become
active.  
"There are bamboo shoots, though."  
  
I looked down and saw a large bamboo shoot peeking out. A large bamboo
shoot means it's past its prime for eating.  
I messed up. If I had found this place early in the morning, I might
have been able to eat some bamboo shoots. But the sun had to be somewhat
high before it shone in, so I couldn't find the bamboo grove. Even
though it's not an urgent journey, spending the night here just for
bamboo shoots feels kind of wrong.  
But...  
"I'll keep searching!"  
I can't help it if I'm curious. The sun hasn't fully risen yet, and if
it's a dark place, I might find bamboo shoots that haven't poked their
heads out yet!  
So, I searched for about 30 minutes. Then, near the edge of the grove,
in a place shaded by giant trees, I noticed a sensation like something
was poking the sole of my foot, and I quickly dug up the leaf mold.  
"Found it!"  
  
It took me 30 minutes to finally find one bamboo shoot.  
I carefully pierced the base with my antler spear and dug it up, and a
30-centimeter shoot came out. Maybe it was because there was still a
little snow left around it, and the sun didn't shine on it, so it was
growing slowly?  
...Well, it's slightly overgrown, maybe?  
"Oh well!"  
I moved to the sunniest spot in the bamboo grove, removed the
accumulated fallen leaves, made a circle with stones to prevent fire
from spreading, gathered dry fallen leaves there, and lit a fire.  
Yeah, I really have to be careful with fire, it's dangerous. Just in
case, I gathered snow and surrounded the area even further, and when the
fallen leaf campfire weakened, I stuck the bamboo shoot in the middle
with its skin on.  
"How long will it take to cook♪"  
While humming a tune, I carefully flipped it over, added fallen leaves,
and baked it slowly so it wouldn't burn, and it was done.  
  
"Hafuu"  
I peeled the skin from the tip, sprinkled it lightly with salt, and took
a bite.  
"I can taste a little bitterness, but it's delicious enough!"  
Even though it could be eaten raw, the refreshing aroma and crunchy
texture, combined with the soft texture from baking the shoot, made me
feel like my thirst was being quenched by the freshness.  
The hardness and bitterness became stronger at the base, but I'll try
this again if I find another bamboo grove.  
  
"Phew."  
It wasn't enough to fill me up, but I felt satisfied since I had worked
hard to find it.  
After putting out the fire by covering it with snow and stomping on it,
I lay down on my back on the fluffy fallen leaves, and when the horns on
my head hit the bamboo, it made a muffled sound.  
"...Huh?"  
Maybe... I thought, and examined the bamboo. I examined the difference
in sound in detail, and carefully cut off the top part of the young
bamboo that I cut from below the node with my nails...  
"It's water..."  
I guess it's bamboo water? Maybe the season is early, but there was only
a small amount of water accumulated at the bottom.  
"Nguh"  
I drank the bamboo water in one gulp. It might just be my imagination,
but was it slightly sweet? The refreshingness with a green smell
outweighed the sweetness. But...  
"...Peh"  
...A tiny piece got in.  
Well, I feel like I've regained my energy for now. As I was about to
carry my luggage again and leave the bamboo forest...  
"...The radio tower."  
  
I could see the radio tower I had been searching for through the gaps in
the forest.  
If I had continued looking, I feel like I would have gotten lost
again...  
I started walking towards it, pushing through the thicket, and as I
approached the radio tower, I suddenly heard a noise from a distance.  
"...Is something there?"  
When I focused my senses, I felt a faint "presence," and I ran in that
direction.  
There――  
  
***"BumoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
  
There, a four-legged giant animal, nearly ten meters tall, was attacking
a gate reinforced with logs.  
A deer...? No, unlike the deer I fought before, its horns are short and
it's generally stockier.  
That's... a serow?¹  
No, that doesn't matter right now. Giant creatures have increased
intelligence and attack with emotion, but they're basically the same as
animals and don't engage in pointless destructive behavior.  
It's the same as the ruined cities I've visited so far; they attack
places where people are, but places that have been evacuated aren’t
destroyed.  
That means――  
"There's still 'someone' there!"  
  
The skin on both of my legs was covered in rippling bright red scales,
and the giant serow immediately noticed my presence as I kicked off the
ground, blowing it backwards.  
***"BumoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"***  
The giant serow lowered its stance and jumped out to meet me.  
Even if it’s short, its horns are sharp enough to pierce me, and its
kick would shatter my bones.  
Clang!!  
The giant serow's horns were chipped by the colliding antler spear, and
I, who was lighter, was knocked back.  
The giant serow must surely be in pain, but it only shook its head
lightly to regain its posture, and then swung its head, which was bigger
than my torso, down to crush me.  
  
"――!"  
The distance was too close to use the spear. I quickly tossed it aside,
put "heat" into my right hand covered in scales, and thrust my right arm
up to pierce its jaw with my claws.  
――Dossh!  
***"...Buo"***  
The giant serow faintly groaned and lost its strength and fell with a
ground-shaking thud. As I pulled my arm out of the fallen giant serow, I
could see in the corner of my vision the gate of the radio tower, which
had been under attack. It was creaking and starting to open.  
Was someone there after all?  
Just as I was about to walk towards it, thinking that...  
"――!?"  
  
I readied my antler spear at the figure that appeared from inside,
standing about five meters tall.  
"A giant ape!"  
When I readied my antler spear and released my "presence," the giant ape
covered in brown fur raised both arms.  
  
***"...Different! I, not enemy!"***  
  
............  
"It spokeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!?"
