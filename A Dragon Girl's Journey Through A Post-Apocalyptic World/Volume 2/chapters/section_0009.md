# 38 The Ape’s Friend (4)

"……Human bones?"  
Utan's important things. In the indoor parking lot where they were said
to be stored, there was a countless number of what appears to be human
bones.  
Although it’s completely dark, I could see clearly. They weren't the
bones of apes or other beasts. Among them, apart from the human bones
piled up on the left and right, one skeleton leaning against the wall at
the very back caught my eye. That was...  
  
***"Tsubaki."***  
A shadow fell over the entrance where a faint light from outside shone,
and Utan's voice, as usual, stopped me there.  
"Utan... what's this?"  
I asked quietly, trying not to change my tone, and Utan also crouched
down and quietly entered the parking lot.  
***"That, important. So, no, touch."***  
"This is...?"  
***"Yes, my 'friend'."***  
Utan said that with a somewhat lonely tone, then passed by me, who was
standing, and gently stroked the skeleton leaning against the wall at
the very back.  
"Didn't you say your friend 'disappeared'?"  
***"Yes, disappeared. So, can't, talk, anymore."***  
"……?"  
  
Perhaps, they died, and their existence disappeared, so they
*disappeared*?  
But even ordinary animals should have the emotion of grieving when they
lose their young or parents, right? Even dogs and cats show signs of
sympathy when their owners are sad. Is it possible that an orangutan
with higher intelligence can't understand that...?  
Or is it simply a difference in language ability...?  
"Passed away" means "gone"? Was Utan misunderstanding the meaning of the
words? Because words could be exchanged to some extent, maybe I was
demanding too much understanding from him.  
  
"So, is this a grave?"  
The first thing I felt when I saw this place was the suspicion that Utan
was "eating people."  
I'm a "dragon," but because I'm in the form of a "human," my
consciousness is close to that of a human. I felt a sense of closeness
and became quite emotionally attached to Granny. But more than that, I
think it's important whether I can connect with the hearts of others,
like Jinbei and that cat.  
Utan said that he was attacked by humans, so he escaped here.  
Utan needs a large amount of food because of his large size. So...
that's not to say that I, who can live on ordinary food, should blame
Utan for eating the humans who attacked him; I think that's a little
different.  
I'm a different species, but I've eaten giant creatures, so I don't have
the right to blame him.  
But... how did that "friend" die?  
  
When I asked him if it was his friend's grave, Utan turned around.  
***"...Grave, what?"***  
"To mourn the remains of the deceased... does that make sense? That
skeleton is, um... a place to cherish it, right?"  
***"Yes! Cherish!"***  
Utan seemed happy at my words? As always, it's hard to understand an
orangutan's expression, but he was nodding.  
"Then, can I mourn too?"  
  
Praying and worshiping, religion and gods, are foreign to those who
don't believe in them, so I used those kinds of words.  
There's no incense, and I don't know if that person was Buddhist, but
the reason I thought about doing something like that was because I was
reminded of Granny, and because I didn't feel any "malice" from Utan to
deceive me.  
  
***"Mourn, what?"***  
"Can I cherish it too?"  
***"Good! Tsubaki cherish too!"***  
I somehow got through... I wonder? Honestly, I feel like burying them,
but I can't do what I want with Utan's important things.  
Because it's at the very back, it's too dark to see the details, but
when I knelt down in front of that person and put my hands together, I
suddenly felt a slight sense of discomfort.  
The moonlight reflected off the snow from outside faintly dimmed.  
  
BOOM!!  
  
Cracked concrete. Scattered debris...  
"……What are you trying to do?"  
Utan, who had smashed the floor with his huge arms, raised his voice in
a panic at my words after I jumped back immediately.  
***"WRONG!"***  
"――!"  
BOOM!  
I stumbled on a femur that had fallen and lost my balance, and was
slammed against the wall by Utan's arm.  
"Kuh."  
I wonder if I hurt my internal organs, there's a taste of blood in my
mouth. I tried to put strength into shaking off the hand holding me
down, but it didn't budge against the orangutan's monstrous strength.  
  
***"Calm down, Tsubaki! 'Friend' break!"***  
"Who are you to talk!"  
While holding me down, Utan was worried about whether the human bones on
the wall were broken. I'm curious as to why he did this, but I finally
noticed the discomfort I had felt earlier.  
"Utan... that 'friend'... why are their arms tied up?"  
  
The human bones leaning against the wall, which Utan called "friend,"
had the parts from the wrists tied to the wall and left there.  
When I glared at Utan, who looked like he’d been keeping them locked up,
he made a troubled face.  
  
***"I, 'friend', love. But, make child with me, said hate."***  
"……No way, Utan."  
  
I don't know why, but at that moment, as if something was flowing in
from the human bones, a scene faintly floated in my mind.  
From there, it became mixed with my own speculation, but Utan's
zookeeper was still a young woman.  
Utan's mother, who was raised in a zoo, didn't know how to raise her
child. It was that zookeeper woman who raised Utan, who had been
abandoned.  
Utan didn't think of that zookeeper as his mother, but perhaps she and
those around her poured so much love into him that Utan came to think of
young human women as "companions."  
Perhaps Utan's "friend" means *companion* ... and "important friend"
probably means *mate*.  
Why did that zookeeper die? I could tell by looking at those human
bones...  
She was rejected as a mate and tried to escape, but her limbs were
broken and she was imprisoned... The remains of this zookeeper had a
broken pelvic bone.  
***"But, no lonely anymore! 'Friend' come! Tsubaki, here! I,
cherish!"***  
  
The reason he was gathering people at the radio tower was to capture the
next "friend" candidate.  
Other than young women who are "friends," he killed and ate anyone else
as meat. The reason he deliberately piled up the bones like that was
probably because that way, the "friends" would be more docile.  
The reason he attacked me was to break my limbs and make me unable to
move.  
To make me, who looks like a young woman, his next "important
friend"...  
  
"……Words are difficult, aren't they?"  
***"Tsubaki?"***  
Utan tilted his head quizzically at my muttering.  
I thought that if words could be understood, intentions would be
conveyed. I thought that if we could talk, our hearts would connect.  
But, it was different.  
Like Jinbei, even if words weren't understood, feelings were conveyed.  
But, fundamentally different creatures can't communicate their feelings
even if they understand each other's words.  
So... "Goodbye."  
  
―Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh―  
  
***"T-Tsubaki!?"***  
Utan was flustered when I started raising my voice while being held
down. Surely the hand that grabbed me is feeling considerable "heat."  
I'm sorry, everyone... Even if I can't bury you, I'll cremate you.  
  
―"Dragon's Breath"―  
  
GooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
***"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! WHY!? WHAT!?"***  
Instead of the usual flash of heat, the enormous flames that overflowed
from my mouth instantly turned the parking lot into a sea of ​​fire.  
***"……Why……"***  
Even as he carbonized in the high heat of thousands of degrees, Utan
muttered that to the end and burned to ashes in the flames... along with
the remains of the people Utan killed.  
I stared at him in the flames and muttered while exhaling the breath I
had been holding in.  
"...Because you don’t understand why, we became 'enemies,' Utan."  
  
The fire that broke out from the parking lot gradually spread to the
entire radio tower.  
The radio tower's grounds are surrounded by concrete walls, so I don't
think the fire will spread to the forest.  
I gazed at the rising flames and the many "lights" ascending to the
sky.  
Maybe I evolved again. By coming into contact with the deaths of many
living beings with wills, my dragon eyes were able to see the "souls"
ascending to the heavens.  
I don't know if they're really souls. I don't even know if souls really
exist. But, I feel like being able to see that and read the lingering
thoughts of willed beings was the reason I was born in a "human form."  
  
"In the end, nothing came of it..."  
All I did was kill Utan, who was living peacefully, and saved the souls
of those who had been killed by him.  
I don't even know if that was the right thing to do right now.  
I just wanted to see someone, even if just a little.  
At that moment――  
"……Hmm?"  
In the distance... beyond the mountains, there was a faint sound, and a
single firework went off, blooming a small flower in the night sky.  
"People... are there?"  
Did someone hear that short broadcast and let me know they were there?  
The direction is... west? Northwest? It's not south, where the people
I'm aiming to meet were evacuating, but... even so, I couldn't ignore
this.  
"Shall we go!"  
I put my belongings on my shoulder, took my antler spear, and turned my
eyes towards the direction of my departure.  
"…………"  
At that moment, I felt like I could see someone looking at me, so I
turned around.  
But I couldn't find anything, and wondering if it was just a remnant of
thoughts, I waved my hand lightly, immediately turned my back, and took
a step towards my new destination.  
  
In the dark forest, a girl wearing a uniform about my age seemed to be
smiling.
