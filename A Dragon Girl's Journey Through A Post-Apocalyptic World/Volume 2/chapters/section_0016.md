# 45 The Children's Way Of Survival (4)

"I want to learn the characters because I want to study."  
The next day, I went with Aki and Rin to get food. There were many
things I wanted to ask, but before that, Rin told me the reason why she
said she wanted to *learn the characters* last night.  
"Yeah, I don't mind teaching you."  
"Yay!"  
When I agreed again, Rin expressed her joy by jumping up and down
slightly.  
There were still many books left in the elementary school that they
could read. Some children had left them behind, so they should have a
complete set of textbooks for all grades.  
"I don't really..."  
But when Aki showed reluctance at the word "study," Rin's eyes widened
and she pressed him.  
"What are you saying, Aki! You'll be able to identify edible grasses and
dangerous animals!"  
"O-okay, I understand..."  
...Is he already under her thumb? They're still young, so they probably
aren't very conscious of the differences between boys and girls, but is
he instinctively sensing that he shouldn't go against her?  
"We can only read hiragana, after all."  
Even so, Aki seemed a little happy. Even if he's not good at studying,
it's fun to learn things you don't know.  
  
While chatting about such trivial things, we searched for vegetables in
the forest.  
The "forest" where the children mainly come to gather food isn't an old
mountain forest, but a former farm field that’s been swallowed up by
trees.  
Of course, some things don’t grow well naturally or due to lack of
sunlight, but when we looked, there were quite a variety of vegetables.
On the other hand, I hardly saw any wild vegetables or vegetables like
wild yams that are originally found in the mountains.  
"Tsubaki-oneechan, is this a 'tomato'?"  
"Probably, yes."  
I only know about it from my "knowledge" and have never seen the real
thing, so I'm not sure, but I think the green-smelling, slightly hairy
fruit is a tomato.  
"Oh, is this a green pepper?"  
"Ugh..."  
When I spotted a vegetable that looked like a green pepper, not only Aki
but also Rin's face stiffened.  
It's certainly a vegetable that children would dislike, but even Rin
grimaced, so I tasted it. It didn't have the faint sweetness that I knew
from my "knowledge," and it was just a genuinely bitter vegetable due to
being wild, which surprised me.  
But what surprised me the most was their physical abilities.  
It was chilling to see them nimbly climb trees that were over ten meters
tall and jump to the neighboring branches more than five meters away.
Rin could easily jump down from a height of about two stories, and Aki
could easily lift stones that were a meter in diameter.  
They're really not "normal"...  
It might be a necessary strength to live in the current world, but I
think it would be difficult for older people to accept it.  
  
Then, we picked some berry-like things that the kids would probably like
and headed back to the elementary school where the toddlers were
waiting, asking various questions without being too obvious.  
"How long have you all been living there?"  
The children were either driven out or abandoned. Asking the wrong thing
could be like twisting the knife, so I asked cautiously, and the two of
them began to tell me their stories bit by bit, as if recalling them.  
"Was it when Rin and I were five years old?"  
"I was four. Until then, we were There."  
Rin looked towards the former prison in the distance with a slightly
complicated expression.  
The two didn’t talk about their lives at the former prison. They may be
too young to remember well, or they may not want to remember.  
But... I'm sure their life there was "happy."  
For the adults who couldn't go south with the other evacuees and were
left behind in this land, the newly born "children" must have been a
real treasure.  
  
"Besides everyone else, were there no other children?"  
Even with the declining birthrate, I can't imagine there were no other
children. If there were families with children, they might have pushed
themselves a little to go south for safety, but if they were still
babies, some people may have been left behind because they couldn't
travel.  
"Hmm, I don't know? I think there was one when I was really little..."  
"Um, I heard that they left because they got older."  
There were other children when the two were young. According to Rin's
memory, when that child was able to travel, they left the former
prison.  
Certainly, if there are government-designated shelters with many people,
that would be better. It would be relatively safer to raise children
there.  
But, really...?  
One or two families, even if they can travel, taking children around the
age of ten to travel in a world with giant animals? If they had a car,
maybe they could go? Even though the roads were buried over the course
of ten years, did parents with children make such a decision?  
  
"Even so, have you two been together since you were that young? Were you
alright?"  
Five and four years old. Kicking away such toddlers is like telling them
to die. The two have physical abilities that you wouldn't expect from
children, but even so, there's no way they'll be alright.  
However, while I harbored such indescribable feelings, the two of them
shook their heads.  
"It wasn't just the two of us?"  
"Eh..."  
I gasped, thinking that Hina, who would’ve been only a year old at the
time, and even the infant Riku might’ve also been there.  
"No, there was a 'nee-chan' we didn't know."  
"Yeah, that 'onee-chan' taught Aki and me a lot of things."  
"Huh? Nee-chan?"  
  
To summarize the stories the two told alternately, a "nee-chan" suddenly
appeared before the two of them, who had been abandoned far from the
settlement and were crying in despair.  
Since it was a nee-chan they didn't know, she wasn't one of the people
who had taken refuge in the former prison. That person picked them up,
took them to the elementary school, and taught them how to get food and
survive.  
I think the reason why the two easily trusted me, even though I was a
suspicious girl with a tail and horns, was because I looked similar in
age to that "nee-chan."  
  
"Where’s that person now?"  
"At some point she disappeared."  
"She was a weird 'nee-chan'."  
The two muttered that with a somewhat exasperated yet nostalgic
atmosphere.  
Anyway, according to the two, that person was a "weird nee-chan."  
She acted like everything wasn’t her problem, leaving them alone and
neglecting them, as if it were natural. She would lend a hand, but
basically made Aki and Rin do everything, and if they were about to
starve, she would suddenly bring a mountain of food.  
She would disappear for a day or two and then come back casually. She
wouldn't coddle them even if they were crying, but she would stay close
to them when they were lonely.  
Eventually, she started disappearing for several days at a time, and
about two years later, when Aki and Rin were able to survive on their
own, she stopped coming back.  
By that time, the two had resigned themselves to the fact that she was
like that, so they weren't that sad.  
  
"The 'weirdest' thing was that she always wore beautiful clothes!"  
"That's right! We got a lot of things from her, and they were all
beautiful!"  
The clothes, dishes, and shoes that she gave them weren't the dirty
things you'd find in ruins, but all "new."  
If there was an untouched supermarket, that might be possible, but she
always wore the same black clothes and a black skirt, and she wore shiny
shoes.  
"...She's certainly a strange person."  
What does this mean? There are a lot of mysteries.  
"What are you saying? Tsubaki-neechan suddenly appeared, too, didn't
she?"  
"Oh, that's right."  
From the children's point of view, I was a strange person who suddenly
appeared with a lot of meat.  
"Not as weird as Tsubaki-oneechan with the horns and tail, right?"  
"Right."  
I was the "weirdest" person?!  
Even so, they trust me, so they must be good kids after all.  
  
But, to give them brand new things... Could it be that the new hand
mirror in the forest was left behind by that person...? So that I would
notice this place?  
Is she really... human?  
Her appearance and clothing... A school uniform? It was somewhat similar
to the ghost of a girl I thought I'd seen in the forest by the radio
tower.  
Could it be that she's really a ghost? Or is she a real person?  
There are so many mysteries... about that girl.  
  
"I'm home!"  
“”"Welcome back~"””  
When we returned to the elementary school, Hina, Riku, and Sora rushed
out to greet us.  
Even though I thought it would be okay based on what I knew so far, I
felt relieved to see the three of them safe.  
These kids aren't "normal" either. According to Aki and Rin, since these
three have been together, they haven't had any major injuries or gotten
sick.  
They're still young, so their physical abilities aren't as good as Aki
and Rin's, but I didn't even sense their presence until they called out
and showed themselves.  
I want to teach these children a lot of things. It's not like I learned
things myself, I only know it from the "knowledge" I was born with, but
I want to do something for the children who were rejected by adults.  
"I'm home, everyone."  
Saying that, I hugged all three of the toddlers who had jumped on me.
