# 46 The Children's Way Of Survival (5)

"So then, what kind of studying shall we do today?"  
"I think ‘arithmetic’ would be good."  
"Me too!"  
When I asked the children in the elementary school classroom, Rin and
Riku both wanted to study "arithmetic".  
Rin wants to study math simply because she feels the necessity of
counting numbers efficiently in her future life, but I think
four-year-old Riku likes math because he finds enjoyment in the numbers
that represent things as quantities.  
"I want Romaji!"  
"I want ‘geography’."  
Five-year-old Hina wants to learn "Roman letters". She quickly memorized
"hiragana" and "katakana" and found joy in learning new characters.  
Aki wanted to learn "geography" because knowing the vastness of the
world had increased his desire for knowledge and adventure, as he only
knew about this narrow region until now.  
"Chuba."  
There, three-year-old Sora, who was independently writing the hiragana
*aiueo* in a notebook with a pencil, proudly called my name *Chuba
(Tsubaki)* and spread open the notebook with a beaming smile.  
  
When Rin asked me to teach her "characters", I was troubled about how to
teach her with my "knowledge".  
After all, if I started teaching kanji and grammar, wouldn't it take
several years just to teach the basics? So, I decided to focus on
teaching *conjunctions* so that they could have conversations as
"sentences" and easily understand the content of books. If they knew how
to use a kanji dictionary, they could read books while gradually looking
things up.  
But that alone can get boring, and it would be difficult for the little
ones.  
So, for Hina and the other toddlers, I decided to focus on increasing
their interest in things by teaching them how to write hiragana, simple
addition, and by reading picture books and encyclopedias.  
After all, this is an elementary school. Although many things are
dilapidated after these ten years, if you search the faculty room and
library, there are still clean textbooks and notebooks, so there's no
shortage of teaching materials.  
While teaching them various things, their interests became scattered,
and the things I had to teach increased.  
No, I didn't learn it myself, I just know it as "knowledge" from birth,
so I can only teach up to the level of elementary school!  
  
Even so, I don't intend to force the children to learn. I only teach
them what they’re personally interested in.  
Because right now, these children are finding joy in "learning".  
I only have the feeling I got from my "knowledge", but within that
"knowledge", there is a fixed idea that *children hate studying*, and I
couldn't fully understand it.  
But I finally understood the meaning of it as I taught the children who
were learning what they needed as wisdom.  
People learn because they need to. They learn because they’re curious.  
Originally, learning new things is "fun".  
Of course, it's not fun to be taught something you don't feel you need.
And on top of that, they create disparity by assigning "scores" to see
if you've memorized it.  
When that happens, studying becomes a task for getting good scores, and
the motivation becomes mainly the feeling of superiority of being better
than others.  
Therefore, these children, who have no disparities, know the joy of
knowing and enjoy learning.  
But that's because...  
(It’s because they’ve been separated from the adults, isn’t it...)  
  
Because adults with fixed views on education didn't teach things
efficiently, the children are learning in an inefficient and fun way.  
I don't know if that's a happy thing or not...  
It’s been almost a month since I started teaching the children in that
way.  
  
Well, me too. I didn't intend to stay that long either. I'm just a
"guest". Otherwise, I can't travel.  
When it came to Jinbei and Granny, they were both elderly, so I thought
it would be okay to stay with them for a few years until they passed
away. But these children are different...  
It's not good for them to be with me, a "non-human". If it becomes
normal for them to be with me, someone who can even fight giant
creatures, they won't be able to leave me.  
I think Aki and Rin understand. They said I was a *guest* when they
introduced me, just like the *weird nee-chan* who taught them what they
needed. They understand that I'll be leaving here.  
But... the little ones aren't like that. Even though I know it’s not
good for me to stay with them any longer, I've selfishly stayed here for
a whole month.  
"Humans" cannot live with "Dragons".  
At least... not yet.  
Until I... understand the meaning of why a "Dragon" was born into this
post-apocalyptic world.  
  
"Fuuh..."  
I'm exploring the area around the elementary school and the burned down
city by myself.  
It would be fine for Aki and Rin to go with me, but the two of them have
a hard time going far because they have to take care of the little ones.
So I decided to look for places far away with food and resources and
teach them about them.  
Besides, I also need to be alone sometimes. I've always been alone, so
it's easier in a way, but it would be terrible if a giant animal was
nearby. Even if there weren't, packs of wild dogs or apes would be a
threat to the little ones, so I wanted to deal with them alone if
possible.  
"There's no danger... huh?"  
Since there was Jinbei, I thought there might be some wild dogs, but I
haven’t seen any. So perhaps when they gather in groups they get
targeted by large omnivorous animals.  
But the fact that I don't see them very often suggests that the main
food source for carnivorous giant animals is... humans?  
I haven't felt the presence of giant animals this past month. According
to Aki, there is a "giant horse" around here. I killed the bear, but are
there others? I think it'll be okay for a while because that one
probably claimed it as its territory, but I need to be vigilant.  
And also...  
  
Thump! With "heat" in my legs, I jumped from the rooftop of the ruin to
the building next door, quickly ran across several kilometers, and
landed on the rooftop of a four-story building.  
"...What are you doing?"  
"Kuh..."  
The person turned to me with a very surprised face as I suddenly
descended from the sky.  
I had been feeling something like a "gaze" for several days. Aki and Rin
can't sense presences like I can, so they hadn't noticed, but I've been
feeling it occasionally.  
I didn't feel any malice. I didn't feel the presence of any "mysterious
power" unique to giant animals, so I thought it was a crow or something
and left it alone for the time being, but I felt something like an
"emotion" in that gaze, so I came to check it out today.  
But... there was the man who seemed to be the leader, whom I had met
only once a month ago. He was holding a hunting rifle as he did then,
and I pointed my antler spear at the man's neck as he momentarily
reached for it.  
"Don't move. I can kill you in an instant, you know?"  
Well, I don't intend to kill him unless he has hostile intentions, but
if he is planning something malicious, I might as well kill him.  
I have a form close to that of a human and "knowledge", so my
consciousness is drawn to humans, but basically, I’m neutral. I don't
have a sense of completely affirming anything that happens.  
I prioritize beings that I've connected with, like Jinbei and Granny. I
eliminate potential enemies like Utan, even if they have no ill will.
And if they have "malice" toward the children, I won’t hesitate to
eliminate them without the children noticing.  
"Really, what are you doing here?"  
  
I put "heat" into the antler spear, not enough to burn him. But I
unleashed the presence of a "Dragon" on the man who was trying to dodge
it in surprise, binding his movements.  
"...So, you were a ‘monster’ too?"  
The man glared at me while sweating profusely at my presence.  
"Me... ‘too’?"  
"...That's right. I noticed you were with the children. I simply came to
see if a mysterious thing like you was still around. Isn't that what you
want to hear?"  
He answered as if foreseeing what I wanted to ask. As if intentionally
evading my question.  
"Why do you care about the children now?"  
When I asked again, he showed a moment of hesitation.  
  
I understand that he would consider me dangerous and check on my
movements. But why is he doing it?  
From what I saw last time, I felt that he was in a leader-like position
of the settlement at the former prison. If he just wanted to check, he
could have had someone like the guy with glasses do it, but it felt
strange that the leader himself was coming to check on the situation
alone.  
  
"...I just wanted to make sure the children weren't in danger."  
He said, squeezing out the words under my pressure.  
"After you abandoned them?"  
"That's no..."  
He swallowed the words he was about to say to refute me.  
"No, I guess that's not true... We were afraid of the children's power.
They were the first children born in this world. There's no way we
wouldn't be happy. But... those children were different from us."  
  
The newly born lives had "power" suitable for this world.  
They preferred to eat raw meat from giant animals that adults couldn't
eat without cooking it. Their physical abilities were so different from
the children born before that they sometimes injured them.  
Even if they got hurt, they’d heal quickly. They rarely got sick. And...
there was an incident in the past where a refugee they had accepted
attacked a woman, and two children, ages five and four, mercilessly beat
him half to death... Their mothers were terrified by that mentality.  
  
"They definitely loved their children... but they saw them as different
creatures from themselves, and the mothers broke down and rejected
themselves for giving birth to them."  
"............"  
So, they had no choice but to abandon the children. The newborns Hina
and the others were still just babies, so they were watching them, but
in the end, they were the same as Aki and the others.  
The adults didn't hesitate either. Unable to bring themselves to kill
them, the children, who were supposed to be eliminated and left to die
by the act of abandonment, were saved by a strange *weird nee-chan* .  
  
"If you can't love them, why don't you just leave them alone?"  
"There's no way we don't love them! That child... Rin is my daughter."  
"I see..."  
The reason Rin seems to be a coordinator may be because she resembles
him. Even so, he had no choice but to make the decision to abandon the
children as the leader of the settlement.  
...If you really love them, you should abandon the settlement and choose
to live with the children.  
But I didn't say that. Because I know that all that awaits a mere human
who does that is "death".  
The children and the humans before them are that different. Even though
he loves them, he thinks the children "too" are monsters.  
Still, perhaps with whatever remained in his heart, he was worried about
the children, including his daughter, being with me, a "real monster",
but that wasn't the only reason.  
  
"We decided to abandon that settlement. Now that we know there are
creatures like you in this world, we realized that we need to live in a
larger group."  
"...Are you leaving the children behind?"  
"That's right."  
He wanted to see them one last time? He nodded without hesitation, even
though his face showed a look of anguish at my words. I removed the
antler spear I had placed on his neck, eased my presence, and he took
his hand to his neck and distanced himself from me.  
"You're not the only reason. This area is being attacked by a herd of
giant horses. If they run out of food, they'll roam around and
eventually come back here."  
"I understand..."  
  
I watched him leave after he said what he wanted.  
That settlement must have been feeling the limits of its strength as
well. Still, whether it was out of love or guilt, the adults who
remained decided to leave after learning of my existence.  
Honestly, the chances of that many people traveling and reaching the
southern shelter aren't very high...  
  
"…I guess I can't tell those kids."
