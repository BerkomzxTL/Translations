# 43 The Children's Way Of Survival (2)

"Tsubaki-neechan, hurry up or we'll leave you behind!"  
"Over here, Tsubaki-oneechan!"  
The boy walking ahead waved his hands as if jumping, and the girl pulled
my hand as if urging me.  
"Is it near here? Aki, Rin?"  
When I called their names, the two of them turned around with delighted,
full smiles.  
""Yeah, just a little further!""  
  
After leaving that settlement in the former prison, the children who
suddenly appeared didn't cower when they saw my horns and tail, nor did
they ostracize me as non-human like those adults did.  
But that's not to say that the children have overcome such prejudices,
but rather that I think they haven't met enough humans to even have
prejudices in the first place.  
And that's not all. More than that, the children intuitively understand
the current world.  
"Because this ‘world’ has changed, right? Humans will change too,
right?"  
When I asked the boy if he wasn't surprised that I had a tail and horns,
he said that and smiled, showing his missing front tooth.  
Ten years ago, this world suddenly changed. Certain animals became
gigantic, and the giant creatures imbued with "mysterious powers"
changed even the way the world was.  
All the common sense we had before doesn't apply. The land and sea
creatures that had supported human sustenance bore their fangs all at
once, attacking humans, with some even preying on them.  
Therefore, the humans who had lived until then deny what didn't exist in
the world before.  
But, I think that for those born after the world changed, like the
children, the changed world is the correct one.  
  
"Tsubaki-neechan, look!"  
"That's our home!"  
"...A school?"  
The boy is Aki. The girl is Rin.  
Aki is 9 years old, and Rin seems to be 8 years old. ...Seemingly,
because neither of them remembers their birthday, and in this world
where the calendar has disappeared, only the changing of the seasons is
the means of counting years.  
The place that the two called "home" was an elementary school about an
hour's walk from the settlement in the former prison near the river.  
It certainly looks habitable, but...  
"Have any giant animals attacked you?"  
Looking closely, there are places where the fence surrounding the
grounds is broken, telling the story that this place is by no means
safe. But Aki and Rin laughed innocently as if they didn't care about
that.  
"Giant animals? You mean big ones? We're fine!"  
"Yeah! We chase them away!"  
"...You're amazing."  
""Yeah!""  
  
Chase them away? These two chase away giant animals? What's going on?  
But when I listened carefully, they don't chase them away, but rather
guide them by throwing stones and taking them somewhere far away. ...No,
no, no, even so, you can't normally do that, right?  
Why are children doing such a thing...?  
Apparently the giant animals that appear around here are very fast. The
children themselves didn't seem to know what kind of animals they
were.  
"That's probably a ‘horse,’ isn’t it?"  
I don't think there are wild horses in Japan, so maybe at racetracks?  
"Heeh… So that's a horse, huh."  
Rin repeated the word as if savoring it.  
It seems that Rin knew the name of the being. Did she see it in a book?
Rin seems to have a higher desire to learn, but Aki seems to have a
competitive spirit, and he taught me things to show off what he knows.  
  
"That's nothing! The dangerous ones are the really big ones that come
sometimes. Tsubaki-neechan, be careful!"  
"Aki, that's called a bear! I saw it in a book!"  
"I-I knew that..."  
Bear... a bear! Eh, that was appearing around here? Maybe it was hunting
giant horses because there wasn't enough food in the mountains, but how
have these children and those adults survived?  
"If it’s a bear, well, I took it down."  
When I said that, the two of them looked surprised.  
"No way... it's as big as a house!"  
"I brought some meat. Let's eat it later!"  
When I patted the leather bag I was carrying on my back, there was a
sound of it being tightly packed, and the two believed me and widened
their eyes in joy.  
"Tsubaki-neechan, awesome!"  
"Meat, Aki! Everyone will be happy!"  
  
...Everyone?  
It seems there were other people besides Aki and Rin. Not just children?
Did they separate from the settlement in the former prison as a
family?  
I want that to be the case. I deceived my heart with such
expectations.  
I might’ve known the truth all along. But that was too cruel of an
assumption.  
"Everyone, I'm home!"  
"We have a guest today!"  
When Aki and Rin went into the school building, I could hear the sound
of multiple small footsteps coming down the stairs in response to their
voices.  
"Aki! Rin!"  
"Welcome back!"  
"Auu!"  
  
They were children, or rather, toddlers. Three to five years old. No
matter how I look at it, they’re far too young to be separated from
their parents. It made me realize that my prediction was close to the
worst possible outcome.  
"Who?"  
A five-year-old girl among the toddlers reflected me in her eyes. I was
taken by surprise, but I was careful not to show my thoughts on my face,
and I crouched down to meet her gaze.  
"I'm Tsubaki, nice to meet you."  
"Mhm! I'm Hina!"  
Hina answered cheerfully as a small shadow jumped out from beside her
and bumped into me.  
"Chubakki"  
She probably wanted to say "Tsubaki." The smallest three-year-old
toddler hugged me without being shy.  
"That's Sora! And this is..."  
"Riku..."  
A four-year-old boy hiding behind Hina introduced himself.  
This child isn't shy either. I could tell that he was just embarrassed
to meet me for the first time, so I smiled and spread my arms, saying
"Come here," and not only Riku but also Hina hugged me.  
As if... seeking the warmth of an adult.  
  
Are there really only children here? Are there really no adults?  
Are these children really living here by themselves?  
But I couldn't ask the children that. I wanted to believe that my worst
prediction was still wrong. So instead, I hugged the three who had
hugged me tightly.  
  
Five children living in an abandoned school building.  
Nine-year-old Aki is an active and natural-born leader.  
Eight-year-old Rin is a caring and organized older sister who brings
everyone together.  
Five-year-old Hina is a talkative and precocious girl.  
Four-year-old Riku is a slightly shy boy.  
Three-year-old Sora isn't very good at talking, but she isn't afraid and
was playing with my tail.  
And... there are no adults.  
"Are Aki and Rin coming too?"  
When I asked if I should hug the two of them too, Rin hesitated for a
moment, but then hugged, looking a little embarrassed.  
I'm not an adult either, but I'm older than these children.  
I'm still small in height and chest, but I can still hug them.  
"I-I'm not a kid anymore!"  
Aki's gaze shifted in confusion, and in the end, he turned away with a
bright red face as if he was angry.  
"Aww, Aki, you're embarrassed!"  
"I'm not!"  
Aki hurriedly shouted back at Rin, who was teasing him.  
Rin slipped out of my arms and ran away laughing as Aki approached as if
a little angry, and the three infants were laughing happily at the sight
of Aki chasing after her in a hurry.  
  
Surely these five have been living like this.  
The two older kids were messing around without being serious, and the
younger ones were laughing.  
This was the children's daily life.  
Seeing that scene, I felt as if I had been forced to face reality.  
  
These children are... children abandoned by the adults in the former
prison.
