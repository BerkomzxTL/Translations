# 31 Signs Of Spring

"...Alrighty then!"  
I stood up with renewed vigor as the fatigue began to fade, and shook my
head to flick off the water.  
Now then... since I went through the trouble of defeating it, I shall
partake in the giant crocodile's meat.  
I slung my antler spear over my shoulder and approached the giant
crocodile, my face wrinkling at its size.  
"I really fought something this big, huh..."  
  
Where do you even find a crocodile? Well, I guess it's just a normal zoo
case, huh...  
Thirty meters in length... Including the tail, it's not as big as the
numbers suggest, but even just the torso is the size of several cars.  
The meat on its back is probably no good, since I incinerated it with my
"Dragon's Breath"...  
"No heart..."  
It was good that I was able to target the head with my presence
detection, but I ended up blowing away the heart as well.  
Since there was no other choice, I considered taking other the organs,
but the scales on its back were too hard to cut. I could somehow stab
the belly side with my tusk knife, but I couldn’t flip the giant body
over, so I gave up.  
"...Guess I have no choice."  
Even though I just took a bath, I ended up taking off my fur clothes and
diving back inside through the hole in its back with my tusk knife in
hand.  
  
Luckily, I had aimed at the back, so most of the internal organs were
intact. But why are there so many rocks in its stomach?  
Anyway, I bit into the raw liver which was still intact.  
"Mmm\~\~~..."  
As expected, I think ordinary living things can't eat the meat of giant
creatures raw, and it doesn't feel like there are any parasites or
anything.  
I wonder if this counts as liver sashimi... It's rich and delicious, but
I somehow feel like ordinary creatures shouldn't eat it.  
After finishing the liver, I used my tusk knife to tear off the meat
around its back and ate it raw.  
The meat there was surprisingly normal. It's often compared to chicken
in my "knowledge," and it was pretty much like that, but a bit tougher.
Also, the muscle fibers are large, so I struggled to bite through it
even with my fangs. Even meat like this would become normal if cooked,
huh…  
Most of the meat that was burned by my "Dragon's Breath" was carbonized,
but the cooked parts had thick fibers and a strange texture, but were
still edible.  
But I prefer the taste of the raw meat, so I kept eating until I was
full...  
  
"...!"  
Suddenly, "heat" accumulated rapidly, and my head throbbed.  
The "heat" spread throughout my body, and I crawled out of the giant
crocodile's body, slid out, and squatted down. Ah, this is...  
"Another growth spurt, huh..."  
I've experienced this several times, so it's no problem. But what's with
this headache?  
After a while, the pain and heat subsided, and when I touched my head,
where the pain was, I felt a slight discomfort.  
"...Eh? What? Why?"  
Confused, I rushed into the river, washed off the crocodile's blood, and
then looked for a place where the water flowed gently to catch my
reflection.  
Ah, as I thought...  
"There are four horns now..."  
  
The original left and right horns had also grown a little bigger, but
two more horns had grown from below them.  
They're still small now, but they won't grow any bigger, right?  
Well, I guess the sides of my head are protected now, so I don't think
they'll grow any more. I don't know though.  
Other than that, my tail has gotten a little longer again. More than
that, have my scales gotten a little bigger? It feels more like they’ve
become more sturdy than just grown. The tip is also knife-like now, so
maybe it can be used as a weapon?  
――Bang!  
"It broke..."  
I slammed it against a large stone on the riverbank, and it easily
shattered.  
It seems like it’ll be useful if more giant creatures continue to
appear, but I'm becoming more and more inhuman.  
  
"Now, what to do?"  
I had decided to head south, where the humans evacuated, but what I'm
thinking about now is food.  
As long as there are towns, there are surprising amounts of food
supplies still left in the houses. I have a personal rule that I don't
loot houses that are still usable, but I loot houses that are unlocked
or have broken windows or entrances, treating them as ruins.  
I’ve found quite a few canned goods like gifts you’d get for New Year’s
and Summer, but it still depends on luck, so I was thinking about
processing the crocodile meat.  
"...Well, maybe later."  
  
For now, I'm a bit tired of meat. I'm also shocked by the increase in
the number of horns, but... for now, I want to eat vegetables. The only
vegetables I can find in a place like this are mugwort and the like, but
I already spotted some earlier.  
I went back to the place where I found them and held up what I had
picked.  
"Butterbur sprouts!"  
I searched for and picked the butterbur sprouts that I had seen earlier.
They were popping up where the snow had melted, so they were quite easy
to find. I also picked a few other things that I found along the way.  
"Alright, taste test... Ugh!?"  
I lightly washed and tasted them, and a considerable bitterness pierced
my taste buds and the top of my head. Even so, I couldn't bring myself
to spit it out, so I chewed and swallowed with tears in my eyes, and
then ran to the river.  
  
"............Ah... That was bitter."  
I rinsed my mouth with the river water and drank the canned juice I had
brought with me, and finally calmed down.  
I knew it would be bitter, but I didn't know it would be this bitter...
But wasn't inedible. In other words, it needs to be prepped to make it
taste good.  
"...Boil it, I guess."  
Once I decided that, I started looking for firewood. There wasn't much
dry twigs or grass because there was still snow, but I also learned
something from the battle with that giant ape.  
I gathered some damp dead branches and piled them up. Then, I collected
a bit of "heat" there, and blew it onto them with my breath.  
Whoosh....  
Some of the collected fallen leaves were blown away, and when I breathed
on the branches, a large amount of steam rose, and a crackling sound
started, and smoke began to rise.  
...It was a little too strong. This time, I weakened the "heat" a bit
more and, fuu fuu, breathed on it, and the steam disappeared from the
branches, and they began to burn.  
"Alright!"  
I successfully started a fire. Now then, let's start cooking.  
  
I drew water into a milk pot and boiled it. Add a little salt. That
should be enough most of the time. I put the butterbur sprouts, which I
had cut off the roots with my tusk knife, into it and boiled them.  
...How long should I boil them for?  
While they were simmering, I made a puddle by stacking stones in a place
where the water was flowing to some extent. When I saw the butterbur
sprouts dancing in the hot water and the color of the water changed, I
cooled them in the melting snow water of the puddle.  
"Next is this. Horsetail!"  
Granny used to say that this was a spring delicacy. I cut off the heads
of the horsetail with my tusk knife, and lightly boiled them as well.
Once they became limp, I rinsed them with cold water, and then I
collected the butterbur sprouts.  
What should I do next... I can eat the horsetail as is with salt, but I
want to do something more with the butterbur sprouts.  
Isn’t tempura a classic? But as it was at Granny's house, oil was a
precious commodity in this world. Granny probably wouldn't have fried
anything if I hadn't been there.  
"...Let's grill it."  
  
I searched the riverbed for flat stones. I carefully washed them and
placed them on top of the newly arranged firewood to heat them up.  
In the meantime, I collected several large leaves, washed them in the
river, and piled the boiled horsetail on top with a little salt... a
little more. I mixed them together using thinly peeled tree branches as
chopsticks.  
It would’ve been nice to have miso or soy sauce, but I didn't bring
any.  
There was still some left at Granny's house, but I thought it might go
bad quickly since I was traveling, so I put it on vegetables and ate as
much as I could.  
Besides... I would end up remembering things through the taste.  
Because of what happened, I was worried about Jinbei, but I decided
against going back.  
Of course, I wouldn't be able to travel if I did things like that,
but... I don't know why, but I felt like it would be better to wait a
little longer. ...For some reason.  
  
"It's about time."  
The stones had heated up nicely, so I grilled the fatty parts of the
butchered crocodile to render out the oil, and then arranged the
butterbur sprouts on top with chopsticks.  
Sizzle....  
The moisture in the butterbur sprouts and sizzling oil created a strange
aroma. I sprinkled salt while flipping them over, and in the meantime, I
tried eating the seasoned horsetail.  
"Mmm\~\~~. I see!"  
The texture was like bracken or wild vegetables. It was delicious, with
a subtle sweetness and no strong taste.  
"Now then... haff"  
I put the grilled butterbur sprouts in my mouth and...  
"Yep! Not bitter."  
Well, the bitterness was definitely still there, but thanks to simmering
it, or thanks to the oil, it was weaker and could now be considered
within the category of food. Actually, it was delicious!  
The greenness wasn’t particularly noticeable, and the bitterness and
faint sweetness were addictive. Thanks to the oil, it felt like I was
eating properly.  
"...This is the taste of spring, huh."  
I'll eat it again if I have the chance.
