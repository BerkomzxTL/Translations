# 39 Abandoned Village (1)

Beyond the mountains... fireworks launched in between.  
It was just one, but listening to the radio from the broadcasting
station on the radio tower, someone let me know they were there.  
There must be "humans" there. ...There's also the precedent of Utan, but
I think that was an exception where various elements miraculously
aligned.  
Speaking of miracles, in the current situation where most electrical
appliances have become useless after ten years and there’s almost no
battery or fuel, it was a miracle that someone listened to that short
broadcast.  
Since they used a valuable means of communication to do that, no matter
where the place is, I have no choice but to go there.  
  
I was able to confirm the new destination on a map I brought from a
commercial building.  
It was on the other side of the mountain, so I had a hunch, but it was
completely in the next prefecture. And as expected, it was in the
northwest direction, which was different from the south that I had
initially intended to go to.  
The problem was that while the map showed the area, the scale of the map
was quite large. Large-scale maps only show major roads. And most of the
roads have been buried in the last ten years.  
In other words, what I'm trying to say is...  
"...I'm lost."  
  
But I can't help it! The only landmarks for my destination are that it's
on the other side of the mountain and the direction!  
I tried to narrow down the area where people could live in a straight
line from there, but the range is too wide.  
In conclusion, it's not that far, but it's not close either. Honestly, I
could barely see it because the air became clearer after people
disappeared, and I think I definitely wouldn’t have been able to see it
if the air had been polluted.  
  
So, I thought that if I took the prefectural road, I would definitely
lose sight of my destination, so I decided to cut "straight" through the
forest and mountains.  
If I go straight, It should be hard to miss it even if the sense of
distance is a little different. If they went to the trouble of launching
fireworks, they must have some kind of landmark.  
Am I, perhaps, smart!?  
...There was a time when I thought that.  
There's no way anyone could just walk straight through a forest of giant
trees that are over ten meters tall!  
I thought it would be okay because I knew the position of the stars? Or
the approximate direction. But there's no way I, who haven't even
studied anything, could know the exact position!  
And before I knew it, I realized that about three weeks had passed...  
  
"It's spring..."  
I sat down on a large rock by a stream I happened to find, and muttered
something like that.  
The remaining snow has mostly melted in the last three weeks, and the
sprouts of trees and wild vegetables, and other things that can be
eaten, have increased, making me realize it's spring.  
The stream was quite clean, so I drank a lot of water to quench my
thirst and felt refreshed for the first time in a while, then took a
bath and did laundry.  
"...Why didn't it burn?"  
I washed the fur of my chestpiece and loincloth, but even though I was
in a huge fire the other day, there's not a single scorch mark on the
fur. Mysterious!  
Does that mean it's completely "mine" now...? I don't know.  
  
While the washed fur was drying, I had a meal since I was by the water
for the first time in a while.  
There aren't any big fish, but I caught some small crabs and freshwater
prawns. And the usual crayfish. Not the American ones that are invasive
species that were all over the place in Jinbei's area, but the native
crayfish.  
I think my physical abilities have also improved. My eyesight’s gotten
better, and I can easily catch anything that moves even slightly by
reaching out my hand  
Using my "heat," I lit a fire with the surrounding dead leaves and
twigs, and arranged them on a flat stone that had been heated thoroughly
to cook them. It’d be faster if I heated the stone with my "breath," but
that's not the way to do it, you know.  
――Crack.  
"Mm!"  
I crushed the thoroughly cooked crab with its shell still on. I just
sprinkled a little salt on it, but it was delicious enough. It might be
difficult for a human to crush it just by cooking it, but it's no
problem for my fangs at all.  
When I bit into it, the first thing I tasted was the aroma, and then a
rich juice spread in my mouth. I devoured everything, pieces from a few
centimeters to the size of my palm, one after another, and also ate the
crayfish and shrimp.  
It's nice that there's a subtle difference in taste. Mountain crabs
don't have a bitter tomalley and are a little bit sweet.  
Finally, I ate a whole small fish that has a slightly bitter intestine,
and that's my lunch for today.  
  
"Fuu... Thank you for the meal."  
I rinsed my mouth, brushed my teeth, put on the dried fur, and prepared
to depart with my belongings.  
For now, I'll aim for the top of the mountain. I’ll be able to see the
radio tower that didn't burn down from there, so I should be able to
figure out the direction. If I'm lucky, I might be able to see a human
settlement.  
And if it's the top of the mountain, the direction shouldn't be too
wrong... probably.  
From there, it took me a whole day... sometimes getting lost, sometimes
climbing up tall trees to check, and finally I arrived at what seemed to
be the summit.  
"I made it..."  
I've eaten all the crocodile meat I brought, so it was really close. I
shouldn't have left the serow meat behind just because I didn't feel
like taking it.  
From there, I climbed an even taller tree to check the direction. I
could see that radio tower, charred and black, in the distance. The fire
was completely out, but there was still a faint smoke rising from it,
probably still smoldering. I thought it would be okay, but I'm glad it
didn't turn into a forest fire...  
  
If that's the radio tower, then the destination should be on the
opposite side.  
"...Hmm..."  
I felt a slight sense of discomfort in the scenery, and I squinted my
eyes to stare at it. I could see something like a building through the
gaps in the giant trees.  
A private house? A farmhouse? It feels too close to have been where the
fireworks were launched, but even if there aren't any people, there
might be traces of where they went, and more importantly, there might be
food left.  
I could store up food to a certain extent, but securing food is the most
important thing in a survival situation.  
I jumped down to the ground from the ten-meter tree and picked up my
luggage, then climbed to the top of the giant tree again, bending it as
I went.  
"Let's goooooo!”  
Whashaaaa――  
Using the momentum of bending it with all my might, I scattered a large
amount of leaves and jumped towards the direction where I saw the
house.  
By the way, if a human did this, they would definitely die.  
"Uwaaaaaaaah!?"  
I was planning to jump onto a nearby tree, but there was no way a normal
branch could support something with that kind of momentum. I broke
through the thickets of several tree branches, and while unintentionally
growing scales on my hands and feet, I landed on the ground, breaking
the trees.  
"Phew! Pfft."  
I spit out the leaves in my mouth amidst the cloud of dust, and stood
up, shaking off the dirt from my whole body.  
Ahhhh... I thought I was going to die.  
But one way or another, I must have covered a considerable distance. I
figured out the direction I needed to head from the way the branches
were broken, re-shouldered my luggage, then ran through the forest and
found the house in about an hour.  
  
"...A village?"  
It was a place with about ten houses, a so-called village.  
Not a villa, but a place where retired couples would live while doing
some light farming or work… it should have been. Because it was that
kind of place, I thought there might be people who were living there
without evacuating like at Granny's, but I could tell at a glance that
there were no humans.  
"Were they attacked..."  
  
Almost all of the houses in the village had been destroyed.  
The ruined houses were in tatters from ten years of wind and rain, but
traces of resistance could be seen on the decaying doors and windows,
such as furniture and folding screens.  
There must have been people here... and they resisted the attacking
giant animals, and were destroyed along with the buildings.  
Here and there in the village... especially in the destroyed areas,
there were scattered reddish-black, bone-like things, and when I touched
one of them with my fingertip, I saw the "scene" from that time for a
moment.  
A huge shadow appearing in the darkness.  
The regret... the fear... of the people that was conveyed... this
is...  
"...A bear?"  
I think it was a giant bear that attacked this place. I just haven’t
encountered one because I've been traveling along the coast and
waterways, but yeah, they would be here.  
I'd like to make them a grave, but if the bones are scattered this much,
I can't collect them, and probably most of the bones won't be
complete.  
It would be fine to just pray, but once I've "seen" it, I can't do
that.  
  
I'll at least try to hold a memorial service for them together, so I
started preparing for that.  
Since there’s still hardly any grass growing due to the season, I broke
the surrounding trees and used them to dig up the ground, circling the
village.  
It would take an endless amount of time by hand unless I had heavy
equipment, but since I'm a "dragon," I can swing even huge logs around
like twigs, so it's not that hard.  
I ate canned food and wild radishes that were left in the houses, and as
the sun was setting, I noticed a large groove in the ground in the
center of the village.  
Several traces like something over a meter wide had passed through...  
This is... the claw marks of a giant bear? If so, then this place
is...  
"――!"  
  
I turned around, sensing an unpleasant "presence" approaching from
afar.  
"That's right... it's spring already."  
The season when animals wake up from hibernation...  
  
A hungry giant bear that had claimed this place as its territory has
noticed my "presence" and was coming.
