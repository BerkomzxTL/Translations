# 48 The Children's Way Of Survival (7)

"What's wrong? Tsubaki-neechan?"  
"Mmn..."  
From this morning, I've had a faint feeling of unease. Hmm... is that
quite right?  
It's not a bad premonition, nor is it anxiety, nor is it a feeling in my
gut...? It's not some supernatural intuition because I'm a "Dragon,"
it's more like an unsettling atmosphere, just a bad feeling.  
"What's wrong?"  
As I tilted my head, Rin came over with the young children in tow.  
  
Today, we were testing whether the wild vegetables, which were being
swallowed by the forest, could be planted in the schoolyard to make a
field.  
Since the vegetables were originally planted by farmers, the yield would
likely increase if they were properly planted in a field, and if they’re
properly cared for, they might be kept free of insects and the
bitterness reduced. I'm cultivating a field while researching natural
farming fertilizers and natural pesticide recipes with agricultural
books I found in the library.  
That's when I started making a solemn face...  
"Tsubaki-neechan is making a weird face,"  
What do you mean, weird!?  
  
"Chubaki"  
Sora clung to my leg as she ran with little steps.  
Sora, who was three years old, was the most attached to me, perhaps
because she was young. ...I'll have trouble when I leave if she gets too
attached, but today feels different than usual, so I picked her up by
her sides.  
...Oh?  
"...Sora, are your ears a little pointy?"  
I hadn't noticed before, but Sora's ears are a little pointy. When I
looked at the other children, their ears were all round, so is this a
feature unique to Sora?  
"Ah, Sora is like that."  
"Riku has little fangs, doesn't he?"  
"Mhm!"  
Riku ran over and bared his teeth, and indeed, his canines were a little
longer.  
The children don't seem to mind. It's certainly not something to worry
about. Some people have long canines like Riku, and it's normal to have
different ear shapes.  
But, when I look at these children's physical abilities, it feels like
they’re starting to adapt to this world, even though they’re not
humanoids born from eggs like me. It might just be my imagination, but I
find it a little strange.  
  
"Chubaki!"  
"Ah, sorry, Sora."  
Sora was angry because I kept holding her. Usually she's happy when I
pick her up, but today she was quiet, and I couldn't help but stare at
her ears.  
"Huh?"  
"Uuu"  
Sora was different than usual. Sora, who is always smiling innocently,
was frowning and gripping tightly onto my hands as I held her up.  
"What's wrong? Sora."  
"What's wrong?"  
When Rin and Aki approached, Sora looked into the distance while
frowning.  
"Shaking, shaking."  
  
At those words, Aki and Rin looked at each other with question marks on
their faces.  
Shaking, shaking? What does she mean...? As I was thinking, I noticed it
too, and hurriedly passed Sora to Rin, crouched down, and put my ear to
the ground.  
"W-what's wrong, Tsubaki-neechan?"  
"Shh..."  
When I asked them to be quiet, the children covered their mouths and
remained still. And to my ears... I could feel faint vibrations on my
skin and horns.  
I see! It's not some vague thing like intuition or a bad premonition. My
senses as a "Dragon" caught it and felt it in the form of "unease."  
"...Something is coming."  
  
A continuous vibration from far away. Many large things... probably a
herd of giant animals is approaching.  
"I think... it's probably a herd of horses."  
"That's right! The cold season is over, so they're coming again!"  
Aki told me in response to Rin's mutter.  
"Is that the ones that Aki and Rin guided away and chased off? Are they
coming periodically!?"  
"Mhm..."  
When I asked, Rin frowned a little as if she was reluctant to say it,
and Aki told me as if remembering in place of her.  
  
"They usually rampage in places where the adults are or in the vegetable
fields and then leave. Once, the adults defeated one that jumped in, and
last year was quiet, so I thought maybe they wouldn't come this
year..."  
"There's no way that's true, right?"  
Rin gave an unpleasant voice, interrupting Aki's words.  
"Are you stupid? If there were that many people, you wouldn't have to
make so many fields, right? But last year, they set fire to the
grassland again, burned down a lot of land, and panicked."  
"I see..."  
  
Slash-and-burn agriculture? Some amateurs tried to make a field and
unexpectedly burned a huge area, and in order to get a large amount of
food, the horses who were circling around had their food... the
grasslands burned.  
Could it be that that person ran away before being retaliated against by
the horses? He gave various reasons, including my appearance, but why
did he keep it a secret at that time?  
So we wouldn't run away too? No way! Were you trying to make us human
sacrifices!?  
"――-!"  
"Nee-chan?"  
"Sorry, it's nothing."  
For a moment, I was about to get angry, but if that was the decision of
a leader who was responsible for more than twenty lives, I can't agree
with it, but I can understand it.  
I can, but――-!  
  
"Aki, Rin! Please take care of the kids! I'm going to check the
situation! I'll be right back!"  
"Ah, I'm going too! Rin, please!"  
"Eh... yeah."  
Leaving Rin and the small children, who were stunned for a moment, Aki
came. Honestly, it's dangerous, and I can move faster alone, but....  
"Can you go?"  
"Leave it to me, nee-chan!"  
Aki said this and laughed as if to hide his slight nervousness.  
He's been protecting the small children with Rin until now. If the same
thing happens again in the future, Aki may need to move alone. For that
time, I decided that it would be better for him to gain experience while
I'm here.  
They’re not just beings to be protected.  
  
"Let's go!"  
"Yeah!"  
I took my spear and ran in the direction I felt the vibration, and Aki
started running along with me.  
Aki has explosive power, as he says he guided the fast horses. He can't
jump onto the roofs of buildings like me, but he still uses steps and
tree branches to follow, albeit a little late.  
I think his physical abilities are on par with those of a professional
athlete. But... he hasn't yet surpassed the limits of humanity.  
I don't know if Aki will be different when he grows up, but for now he’s
still in the category of humans, unlike me, so we ran through the ruins
of the city to make sure he didn't push himself too hard.  
But...  
It was no longer at the stage where we could just wait and see how
things went.  
  
"Nee-chan... what is that?"  
"............"  
I couldn't answer Aki's hoarse voice and was at a loss for words.  
There were several kilometers from the ruined elementary school where
the children were to the former prison where the adults were. Now that
proper roads are buried, it would take at least an hour to reach it, but
it should take only a few tens of minutes for me and Aki to reach it
using trees and building roofs.  
But, there was no need for that.  
A dozen minutes after we set off... We climbed a particularly tall giant
tree to check the direction, and we saw a giant shadow, still far away
and small, crushing the former prison. That is――  
  
――Thud.  
  
"...It's an elephant."  
The ground shook with each step, without exaggeration.  
The vast prison, which was by no means small... The high outer walls
that had been protecting it from giant animal attacks were easily
crushed by the mere act of walking.  
A giant elephant with a height of about fifty meters. When originally
large creatures grow huge, do they grow this big? It's not as big as the
"Island Whale" I saw in the ocean, but the intimidating presence of a
monster like that on land was nothing short of threatening.  
"A-are the adults? Were they killed...?"  
"...They're probably okay. Those people should have left that place a
long time ago."  
"I see..."  
  
Aki had a slightly hurt expression on his face. Abandoned. And abandoned
again.  
Even though he appears smart and insightful, Aki is still a child.  
Did the adults know about this? I'm a little angry, but maybe it’s good
that they were able to escape before that thing came. But, if it finds
out that there are no humans there, it might target the humans in this
area.  
"Aki, let's go back to everyone. Before that thing notices us, we..."  
"Wait, nee-chan! That!"  
Aki stopped me as I was about to go back to evacuate the children.  
"Horses..."  
It was hard to see because they was mixed in with the dust, but there
were a dozen giant horses, each about five meters tall... They were
running around the feet of the giant elephant and seemed to be guiding
it in the opposite direction from the elementary school ― "South."  
"...Let's go back for now."  
"Yeah..."  
  
Aki and I noticed it too. Those giant horses brought the giant elephant
to kill the humans―the adults in that place―for revenge. And, they found
traces of their movements, and chose to follow them and finish them off
for sure.  
The giant animals... will kill those adults out of hatred.  
  
"...Eh?"  
When I reported to the children who had returned to the elementary
school so that they wouldn't be too shocked, Rin, who understood it
accurately, grimaced.  
"Yeah.... If that's the case, then we should escape quickly... right?"  
Rin was unusually hesitant. She understood that there was nothing she
could do and was trying to accept it, but her innate kindness was making
her feel guilty about abandoning the adults.  
On the other hand, the young children didn't seem to mind. They might
vaguely remember their parents, but they were abandoned too young. Aki
and Rin did their best to love them as an older brother and sister, so
those memories may have been overwritten by the kindness of the two.  
But――  
"Is that okay?"  
"Aki..."  
Aki was staring at Rin with a serious look as she made the painful
decision.  
"Rin, you don't want them to die, do you? When they were being attacked
by horses, you were the one who guided them away."  
The story of Aki and Rin guiding and chasing away the horses was not for
their own sake, but to help the adults.  
"But, there's no helping it... those people abandoned us! I care about
you all more than those people!"  
Rin raised her voice as if enduring something, and Hina and Riku held
Rin's hand to comfort her.  
"We won't know unless we try! If it's just me and Tsubaki-neechan, we
might not be able to guide them, but we can buy some time, right?"  
"That's right."  
"That's reckless! I'll go instead!"  
Aki asked for her agreement because it would hurt Rin less that way, and
when I nodded to it, Rin was surprised and squeezed out her voice.  
  
The intelligent Rin probably understands the adults' struggles to some
extent. Therefore, she worries and hurts, while Aki, wanting to remove
that, mustered his courage, and the little children are purely
worried.  
Then... what "I" should do is decided.  
  
"You two stay here and protect the little ones. I'll go alone."
