# 32 A Small Encounter

"It's huge..."  
I had finished eating and started thinking about processing the
crocodile meat, but I was overwhelmed by its size.  
I've already eaten most of the remaining meat around its back. The leg
parts, which have plenty of meat, are covered in thick scales that I
can't even butcher.  
Well, I could do it if I wanted to, but I think it would take a really
long time...  
After all, it's only barely pierceable with my antler spear with enough
momentum, so if I tried to dismantle it with the tusk knife or my claws,
it would probably take about a week.  
In the first place, I realized that even if I cut out a large amount of
meat, I don't have the tools to process it. If there was at least a
decent house, I could borrow a storage room and smoke it...  
"There's none, huh."  
  
There are what look like small companies and houses nearby. I could also
see a town being swallowed by trees beyond the grasslands.  
But...most of them are destroyed.  
It's not all because of that giant crocodile. The crushed lumps buried
in the grass and trees are probably armored vehicles...  
Here too, humans and giant creatures fought. Whether it was before or
after the civilians evacuated would change the extent of the damage, but
at least the riot police or the Self-Defense Forces fought and scattered
to protect people.  
The fact that there was such fierce fighting in a place so far from
major cities probably means that giant creatures came from the north or
something. In other words, it was correct to assume that people had
evacuated to the south.  
Well, in short, there probably aren't any decent houses around here.
There's no point in spending time here, so I decided to take only the
meat I could cut out.  
  
"Around the neck might be good."  
There were no scales around the neck that was gouged out with the
"Dragon's Breath". However, that area got carbonized due to the high
heat, so I'll have to remove that area first.  
But it's much better than the crocodile's thick scales. I thought the
meat might be cooked, but as soon as I scraped off the carbonized part,
raw meat appeared. I think it's because it was blown away in an instant
of ultra-high heat, so only the surface was cooked. But...  
"Huh...it's hard."  
The meat is hard... Oh, that's right, the muscles around the neck are
used often, so they’re all tough!  
"The back wasn't that bad though..."  
I think the back muscles are also used a lot, but is it because there's
also fat? Or...  
"Were your shoulders stiff or something?"  
It doesn't make sense, but that idea felt the most convincing for some
reason. Becoming gigantic is something to keep in mind, isn't it.  
Since there was no other option, I cut out the parts that I could cut
off within reach, cut the meat into ten-centimeter cubes, and wrapped
them one by one in large leaves that I washed with water.  
If I cook it with my "Heat", it’ll become normal meat and easier to cut
out, but there's a reason why I worked hard to cut it out raw.  
Until now, I've processed it into smoked meat for preservation, but
giant creature meat is overflowing with such strange power that even
parasites don't approach it when it's raw. Maybe, just maybe, it won't
even rot due to bacteria or anything even when it's raw and will last a
long time? I don't know, though.  
Even in a sterile environment, it’ll dry out, and when it dies, its
mysterious power will gradually fade away, so I have a feeling it’ll rot
then, but experiments are important.  
  
"Well then, shall we go?"  
I put the meat wrapped in leaves in a plastic bag and carried it on my
shoulder. I cremated the giant boar, but I'm leaving the giant
crocodile. That's because Jinbei's field was nearby at that time, and if
my prediction is correct, the meat should rot and disappear normally
once it dries.  
Um... sorry if it doesn't disappear.  
For the time being, my goal is to return to the train tracks and follow
them south, but before that, I thought I would stop by the abandoned
town and replenish my supplies.  
This area is just grassland, so I won't get lost, and I don't have to go
around avoiding giant trees, so it's probably about a ten minute walk?  
As I ran straight through the grassland towards the town, I could see
the state of it.  
"It's terrible."  
  
From a distance, it was hidden by the trees and I couldn't see it well,
but most of the buildings were destroyed, and many were charred,
probably because of a fire.  
"A cow..."  
There was a huge cow skeleton that was almost swallowed by trees. I've
seen it before, so there might be quite a few. I think it's probably a
cow from a farm? This individual may have been defeated by humans, but
there might’ve been many that became food for the giant crocodile?  
Whether it's because the giant creatures rampaged or because of human
attacks, there don't seem to be any intact buildings left. Still, when I
went around several buildings, fallen leaves had piled up inside, turned
to soil, and grass was growing.  
  
"...There they are."  
When I peeked into the back of a restaurant that had been burned down,
it seemed that canned goods and the like were still left, probably
because the evacuation was rushed. There was some rust on the surfaces,
though...  
However, there were hardly any pre-cooked canned goods, and they're
mostly ingredients? Tomato cans and bean cans everywhere. Was this
perhaps an Italian restaurant? There were also bottled olives and basil
pesto, but... the color’s turned black, and surely bottled foods from
ten years ago are no good, right?  
I did find some small bottles of salt, pepper, and dried garlic.
But...  
"How do you use dried rosemary or nutmeg?"  
To get rid of the smell? To add flavor? I don't really know, but since
they're small, I'll take a few of them with me. When I gathered my
things and went outside the building...  
Flap!  
"Uwa!?"  
I was suddenly attacked by a black something and instinctively shook it
off.  
"Eh...what?"  
  
――Caw――  
  
Several black birds were flying around, perched on the roofs of the
ruins and the branches of trees, looking down at me.  
My "knowledge" finished matching to their appearance and calls.  
"Crows... They were still here, huh."  
I thought that other than small birds, they had all become food for the
giant creatures... Still, did you really think that a few crows could
hunt an animal the size of a human?  
  
Caw, caw!  
Cacaca.  
  
"...Oh, I see. So you were just playing around."  
Crows are said to be highly intelligent. That's why, even if they can't
beat an opponent who can’t fly, they’ll taunt them for fun. ...Why do
highly intelligent animals only resemble the bad parts of humans? Well,
I guess humans are also animals.  
"Go away, shoo shoo."  
  
――Cacacacaca――  
  
When I swung my antler spear around to intimidate them, the crows flew
around mockingly, out of the spear's reach, then flew off somewhere.  
...It's a little annoying. I guess existences like Jinbei are rare in
this day and age after all.  
Still, I’m not going to kill them just because I'm annoyed. Since they
managed to survive in this world, I don't intend to hunt animals unless
they’re openly hostile or I'm going to eat them.  
But well, I think the reason why the crows were safe in this place is
because that giant crocodile had it as its territory...  
As I dazedly gazed at the crows flying away with a feeling of pity, I
noticed that they had joined up with several more crows in a certain
direction and were flying around in a circle.  
  
"...Is there something there?"  
For the time being, I'll head in that direction out of curiosity.  
I crossed over the buildings swallowed by the trees and strained my eyes
in that direction. Then, I saw about ten crows flying over the top of a
ruined, half-destroyed three-story building.  
Is there something there...? There might be a lot of plants that bear
fruit in this area. I took a small red fruit that caught my eye and
tried eating it.  
"Sour."  
And astringent too. But if there are edible fruits like this, even a
crow could survive. The fact that those crows are flying around means
that there might be even more food.  
Thump!  
  
――Caw!  
  
The crows threatened me as I kicked off the building and jumped down
towards them. I lightly swung my spear to intimidate them, and they
didn't attack, but they continued to flap their wings to intimidate
me.  
Well, whatever. As I entered that half-destroyed building, I noticed
that trees were growing even inside. Maybe the building and trees were
protecting against the snow and cold, but the inside was humid and
warmer, even though there was still snow outside. Thanks to that, there
were also trees with fruit, so it seemed like a good place for crows to
build a nest, but I soon realized one of the reasons why they couldn't
build a nest.  
"...Crow bones?"  
  
Several bird bones and crow feathers were scattered, buried in the
weeds.  
It's a good place for a nest, but one of the reasons is that the
branches of the trees get in the way of flying around inside. And the
second is that there might be something hunting crows inside.  
There's a predator in the back. I cautiously advanced with my antler
spear in one hand, and at the very back...  
  
Fwoo――!  
  
There was a small animal threatening me in that slightly wider area.
It's smaller than Jinbei. But it's not as small as a rat. This is――  
"A cat..."  
A cat survived in a place like this? Was this cat attacking the crows
that came in?  
If so, then the crows were targeting this cat, but... I didn't feel like
they were trying to avenge their comrades or anything like that, but
rather like they were attacking me for fun.  
Do they just want to take this place from the cat, or do they just want
to bully it as a group?  
"...Hm?"  
The cat was acting strange. It's threatening me for coming in, but it's
not running away or attacking, it's just staying there and continuing to
threaten me.  
Could it be…!  
  
"You...are you pregnant?"
