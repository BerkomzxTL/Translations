# 35 The Ape’s Friend (1)

***“That’s right! If talk, will understand!”***  
"Seriously..."  
  
It spoke!? That giant ape... unlike the gorilla at that skyscraper, it's
brown and has long fur... probably an orangutan? I think.  
Wasn't it supposed to be a forest sage or something...? I honestly don't
get how that would make it able to talk, but that orangutan, with its
five-meter-tall body, was looking at me with both arms raised. ...If
those arms were swung down, even I'd probably be crushed, so it's a
little scary.  
But the sight was so surreal that I mustered the little willpower I had
left to aim my spear at it.  
  
"You said you're not an enemy, but what are you doing here?"  
***“Pointy thing, don’t! Scary!.... Me, here, waiting for
‘friend’.”***  
I don't understand. Friend? Well, more than that...  
"How did you learn to talk?"  
Are there humans here? When I asked what I was most curious about, the
orangutan giant ape distorted its face, probably smiling, and spoke in a
happy voice.  
***“Me, wanted to talk to ‘friend’!”***  
  
Unsurprisingly, the orangutan's explanation was still partly
incomprehensible, so I'll try to summarize in my own way.  
This orangutan was, as expected, from a zoo. And the "friend" is
probably, maybe, a zookeeper?  
"Did you learn words from that person?"  
***“Yes! Always!”***  
  
It seems that the zookeeper had been trying to teach the orangutan
letters and sign language for a while. This orangutan said that it could
actually do some simple sign language.  
The zoo animals became gigantic, and the powerful giant animals came out
of the zoo one after another, and with their increased intelligence,
they went to attack humans as if to vent their pent-up frustration, but
among them, this orangutan, who originally had high intelligence, did
not leave its narrow cage, and protected the human zookeeper from the
other giant animals.  
  
***“Me, took friend and ran. Big ones, scary. Humans, friends. But,
humans also, scary!”***  
"...Humans are scary?"  
The orangutan was nodding repeatedly still with both arms raised.  
***“Humans, see me, do painful things.”***  
  
This orangutan is also a giant animal, so if it's found by humans,
that's what will happen...  
The wild animals and powerful giant animals broke out of their cages and
ran away, and at first they fought among themselves. But before that
became full-scale, humans... whether police, riot police, or hunting
associations, attacked with weapons that made loud noises, resulting in
"giant animals" vs. "humans."  
In the end, it was only a matter of time, but they had clearly become
enemies there.  
Well, I guess it couldn't be helped.  
Since then, this orangutan has protected the zookeeper and fled to this
radio tower. Fortunately, there was some food left, and it hunted
animals, and the zookeeper was teaching the orangutan, whose
intelligence had increased, words.  
I didn't think it’d be so talkative...  
  
***“So, me, human, friend. Me, not enemy.”***  
"...Okay, I understand for now. You can put your hands down?"  
***“B, but…”***  
"It's okay."  
Am I scary? That's probably why it didn't put its hands down easily, but
the orangutan reluctantly lowered its arms.  
...Thump.  
"............"  
The orangutan's arms seem to make up a large proportion of its body, so
rather than lowering them, they crashed to the ground.  
...What a troublesome guy.  
I can't trust it completely, but there's not much reason to doubt it.  
Well, it still feels troublesome, but I don't feel any "malice," like
the sense of superiority or looking down on others that giant creatures
have, so I'll trust it for now and lower my spear as well.  
  
"...Was the radio from that zookeeper?"  
I'll also ask about the voice that came from that radio. If the
zookeeper was the one who taught it words, then that means there are
still humans alive.  
But when I asked the orangutan about that, it distorted its face
slightly.  
  
***“...Friend, gone. So, me, play radio, call friend.”***  
"...Eh?"  
  
I don't really understand, but the zookeeper went somewhere, or maybe
died. But, eh? It? This orangutan was playing the radio?  
And the reason is because it wanted a "friend"?  
  
***“Radio, play, humans come. You, came. Friend.”***  
"Ah~... yeah."  
The orangutan distorted its face... probably smiling, I guess.  
Still, I didn't think an orangutan could broadcast on the radio... No,
is the zookeeper who taught it amazing? Zookeepers these days can do all
sorts of things.  
***“But, now, can’t use…”***  
"Huh? What do you mean?"  
  
It can't use the radio now. When I asked what it meant, the orangutan
started walking ahead, telling me to follow. Well, this orangutan... the
name is too long to say.  
  
"Hey, what's your name?"  
When I asked the orangutan walking in front, it stopped, glanced back,
and distorted its face again slightly.  
***“Me, friend, called* ‘Utan’¹.”**  
"Utan..."  
How lazy!  
Anyway, it's faster to see it directly than to hear Utan's explanation,
so I quietly followed.  
  
Inside the grounds, there was a place like a flower bed, and when I
looked casually, vegetables were planted there instead of flowers,
hidden by the remaining snow.  
There weren’t many kinds, but it seemed like there were more wild plants
that could be found in the mountains.  
  
"...Are you growing these vegetables too?"  
***“Yes! Me, like vegetables! But, meat, like more!”***  
"Huh... meat, that's unusual?"  
Gorillas are the same, but apes are basically herbivores, and eating too
much meat is bad for them... Well, it's the same for humans, so it's
just a matter of preference after all.  
***“...AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!”***  
"Eh!? What!?"  
Surprised by Utan suddenly raising his voice, Utan hurriedly ran towards
the gate.  
***“THAT MEAT! EAT!”***  
"Ah\~~..."  
The meat of the giant serow that I defeated earlier... It's a waste, but
it took the tension out of me, and I couldn't help but feel deflated.  
  
For now, I'll put off butchering the giant serow and bury it with snow
to cool the meat.  
Hmm... Was I being too wary just because he's a giant animal? Maybe
because he speaks human language so poorly, I don't understand him as
well as Jinbei, or rather, I don't know what he's thinking.  
Well, whatever. Anyway, I don't feel any malice.  
  
The first place Utan showed me was the place where the broadcasting
equipment was.  
Broadcasting room? Studio? Anyway, the place where the equipment was was
small, but Utan skillfully crouched down, and turned on the scratched
switches with his fingertips, but the lights turned on for a moment and
then immediately went out.  
"Speaking of which, what about the electricity?"  
***“That!”***  
As if to say that's what he wanted to say, Utan left the cramped room
and went back outside, leading me to the rooftop.  
"I see."  
On the roof, solar power panels were lined up, probably for emergency or
backup power. But...  
"They're broken..."  
  
By seeing the actual thing again, "knowledge" floated up. I think the
lifespan of a solar panel is about ten or twenty years? There were some
that were cracked and broken beyond that. Eh? Could it be.  
"You're not going to tell me to fix these, are you?"  
As I muttered that with a premonition of trouble, I turned my gaze to
Utan, who hurriedly shook his head.  
***“No! Panels, other place. But…”***  
  
It seems that solar panels of the same standard are nearby. But, that's
where... that giant serow herd lives.  
So, it's not a hassle after all!
