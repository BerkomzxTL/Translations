# 41 Where People Live

"... Itadakimasu."  
In the village, engulfed in flames raging within a hundred-meter radius,
I sank my fangs into the heart of the giant bear.  
The ambient temperature is probably over 100 degrees Celsius, isn't it?
The reason I'm starting my meal in such an environment hot enough to
boil water is that I thought if I left the giant bear here, it would
cook, and its "mysterious power" would dissipate.  
Even in this incredibly hot environment, while I feel somewhat warm, I
don't feel burned. As expected, the fur I'm using as clothing didn't
catch fire either.  
Smoke, or... uh, carbon monoxide poisoning... was it? Since I'm a living
creature, I was worried about how that might affect me, but I don't feel
any physical discomfort.  
Is it perhaps because I'm a "Dragon?" Dragons do live in volcanic
craters and such. It would be embarrassing if a hero saw me collapsing
from poisoning.  
  
—Snap.  
I tore off a chunk of the giant bear's heart, which was larger than I
could hold, with my fangs. Being the center of the bear’s vitality,
blood spurt from the bite, and it was still faintly convulsing.  
... It's getting quite hot. I should eat quickly.  
"Ah~n... mmm."  
I opened my mouth wide, bit down, and swallowed without chewing.  
The giant mass of muscle disappeared in an instant.  
As expected, giant creature meat is best eaten raw. The natural umami of
the meat, with a slight astringency and no fat, spread throughout my
mouth. Unconcerned with being covered in blood, I sat cross-legged on
the giant bear and devoured it ravenously. My injured left arm was
making cracking sounds as it became covered in thick scales and
repaired.  
I must have taken quite a bit of damage. Starving, I devoured the heart,
which seemed heavier than my own weight, in a matter of minutes.  
The moment I ate it, my stomach would swell up accordingly, but by the
time I tore off the next piece of meat, it would return to normal, and I
could feel the power converted into heat filling my entire body.  
  
"... Next."  
The heat around me was starting to discolor the giant bear's wounds. The
bear's limbs were starting to burn from the extremities, dried out by
the high heat, so there isn't much time left.  
"Ah\~~... Are bear paws tasty?"  
I feel like I had some "knowledge" about that.  
Was it that you only eat the right paw because they eat honey, and it
soaks into it? It's already burning, though!  
For now, it's on to the next. I took the antler spear, moved from the
giant bear's chest to its abdomen, and cut it open.  
"... Okay, still good."  
I burrowed into the giant bear's abdomen, searching, and finally found
the liver.  
The liver doesn't store as much "mysterious power" as the heart. Or
rather, unless it's immediately after being killed, the power rapidly
diminishes.  
Not wanting to waste time cutting it out from the abdomen, I bit into
the liver as is.  
Unlike the heart, it had a rich, intense flavor. It was also plump,
soft, and easier to eat than the heart.  
I've never tried it, but was this what pudding is like? It felt like a
little "snack," but from an outsider's perspective, it's probably quite
macabre.  
  
"... Fuuh"  
Crack... crack...  
The scales on my injured left arm peeled off like scabs, revealing
wheat-colored skin with no blemishes or even downy hair. Well, this skin
is scales, so hair won't grow! It's already strange enough that I have
hair above my neck, but that's probably because I'm imitating a human
form.  
—Snap!  
Also, I've grown in various ways, and my tail has become slightly
thicker and was now as long as my height. I got the sense that the
length won't change anymore.  
Speaking of length, the third and fourth horns that have newly grown
have become larger, to about 60% of the length of the first horns. These
also look like they won’t change anymore, so I guess all that's left is
for their strength and such to increase.  
"... Why isn't my height increasing?"  
It had been in the back of my mind, but nearly half a year has passed
since I woke up, and my body hasn't grown. I unconsciously peeked at my
small chest.  
  
"... It's not hot anymore."  
Also, I felt the heat until just now, but before I knew it, even when
exposed to the hot wind swirling from the flames, it only felt like a
gentle breeze.  
The surroundings were still blazing, and the bear's blood that had been
on my skin evaporated just by standing still, so it's not that the
surrounding heat has decreased.  
I think my heat resistance has increased...  
"I'm becoming less and less human..."  
I'm heading to a place where people are. Is this okay?  
As I am, I can crush a concrete block just by putting a little "heat"
into my arm.  
"...Well, whatever."  
  
For now, I've finished what I needed to do here.  
It's not morning yet, but I'll look for a water source.  
I've been drinking blood along with the meat, so I'm not thirsty, but I
want to wash away all the bear blood, soot, mud, and everything else
stuck to my body.  
I cut out several kilograms of raw meat as travel food, wrapped it in
large leaves I picked outside the village, retrieved my belongings, and
left the burning village.  
It's a crude cremation by a dragon's flame, but I hope this serves as a
memorial service.  
And...  
"... The fire is taking a while to go out. It won't spread to the forest
from here, right?"  
I'm concerned, you know!  
  
After that, I’ll head northwest, continuing through the forest in search
of a place where people should be.  
If I just walk around randomly, I might overlook it, but I have some
idea of where to look. It's not that I have an exact location in mind,
but rather, I have a way to increase the chances of finding them.  
First, it's unlikely that people would build a settlement in the middle
of a forest with giant bears.  
Even if the giant bear is omnivorous, if it's roaming around like a
giant boar to maintain its massive body, I don't think any human
settlements would remain. Moreover, if there are many giant animals here
hunting things like giant deer, it's even more unlikely that a
settlement would be built in the forest.  
Therefore, I believe that the settlement where the humans set off
fireworks is in a city.  
It must be in a place with sturdy walls or fences that can withstand the
attacks of giant animals to some extent. I believe that's where the
humans are.  
  
"Well, but... if the person who set off the fireworks is 'alone,'
there's nothing I can do about it."  
That would be truly hopeless. If a human is living alone, like Granny,
they would be living in a way that avoids being found by giant animals,
so it would only be possible to find them through a miraculous
encounter.  
But, in that case, I'll give up completely... I intend to, anyway.  
I'll try searching for about a month, but I feel like it would be a bit
wrong to get too caught up in that and lose sight of my initial goal.  
Still, since they took the risk of setting off fireworks, I want to find
them if I can.  
I'll continue searching for a human settlement while harboring such
contradictions.  
  
—Rustle.  
"—Fuuh!"  
On a hill at the edge of the forest, I stood at the top of a huge tree
and raised my arms high, straightening my back.  
Recently, I've gotten used to using my tail, and it’s become quite
useful. I can support my body simply by wrapping it around or piercing
tree trunks, which frees up both of my hands.  
In terms of distance, this is about the limit. If it's any further away,
I don't think it would be visible from the transmission tower, no matter
how clear the air is.  
In that case...  
"Is that the city...?"  
The city visible from here is the primary candidate. If it's not there,
I'll have almost no way to find them.  
If I go south, there should be people who have evacuated, so even if I
don't meet them here, I'll have a way to find people. But I'd like to
find them here if possible.  
  
"... That's terrible."  
This city, like the others, was being swallowed by giant trees, but when
I got closer, it was clear that it was different from the city with
skyscrapers.  
Crunch... I crushed something black under my foot and dragged it away,
leaving a black line of powdered charcoal.  
"A fire..."  
The cities I've visited so far were lucky... They had time to
evacuate.  
The police and the Self-Defense Forces must have moved quickly to
suppress the giant animals and evacuate the civilians. But not all
cities are like that.  
In places where it takes time for the Self-Defense Forces to arrive due
to the geography, and cities that were attacked by many giant animals
before they could start evacuating, people must have panicked, and many
accidents occurred.  
I'm sure many people rushed to escape without checking their
surroundings. And they were attacked by giant animals... and a fire
broke out.  
  
"... What should I do?"  
There were traces of fire in almost every visible part of the city. Even
when I went into buildings that seemed like I could enter, there was
nothing usable left, let alone food.  
Are there really any humans left in a place like this? Is this really
the right place?  
"I'm starting to lose confidence... huh?"  
A week’s passed since I started exploring the city, and I was about to
give up when I saw something shining in the corner of my vision.  
There’s still glass and metal remaining in the buildings, so it's not
like there's nothing shining. But while most of it is melted or covered
in soot from the heat, that light seemed strangely bright.  
I don't have any other places to search anyway, so I headed toward it.  
And then...  
"This... a hand mirror?"  
A small hand mirror was placed as if it were hooked on a tree branch.  
However, there were no remnants of fire, and no dirt or smudges that
animals might have brought, and it was a brand-new mirror, as if it had
been bought at a store yesterday.  
It had a pink character design and looked like something a junior high
or high school girl would use.  
"Why is it in a place like this...?"  
While tilting my head at the unnaturalness, as if it had just been
placed there to be found, I saw a different scene through the gaps in
the tree branches.  
"An unburned section..."  
Separated by a small river, a place spared from the fire...  
I could only have found it from this location... from this angle.  
From that place beyond, surrounded by high walls, I could see a small
plume of smoke rising, like if there was someone cooking.  
But... that place...  
"... Could it be a prison?"
