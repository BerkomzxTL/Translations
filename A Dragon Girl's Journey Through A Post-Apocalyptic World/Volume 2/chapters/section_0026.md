# 55 Family

Even though I left on impulse and with the flow, I was so lonely being
separated from the children that I decided to go see Jinbei, thinking it
wouldn't be that far if I could fly...  
"...Uwa, so sticky."  
I was already covered in blood from the fight with the giant horses, but
I went too far trying to kill the giant elephant, boiling its blood from
the inside out. A a result, my whole body was sticky with both damp and
dried blood.  
"Ah, there's water."  
While flying through the sky, I found a large lake in the southeast
direction. With flames spewing from the scales on my wings, I dove
headfirst into the lake, which was quickly approaching, leaving a
contrail behind.  
  
Zappaaaaaan!!  
*"Gabo gaboka!"*  
I thought I'd be fine even if I crashed at high speed because of the
scales, but there was quite an impact, like crashing into a concrete
building. I was so surprised that I swallowed a lot of water, but I
continued to fly up with that momentum.  
"...H…uh?"  
――Pssht.  
Then, the flames from my wings went out as if I’d run out of gas, and I
crashed into the lake again in the mist-like water vapor that evaporated
from my "heat."  
Splash!  
"Buha!"  
I hurriedly poked my head out of the water. Maybe I used too much
"heat"!? Since I had such a big fight, it couldn't be helped, but it
cooled down all at once when I jumped into the water. This is the
result.  
"Well... whatever."  
Anyway, because of the flashy landing, all the blood that had been stuck
was washed away all at once.  
The scales on my hands, feet, and back returned to copper-colored skin.
The wings that had completed their role crumbled and disappeared into
the lake.  
Suddenly, as if remembering something, my stomach rumbled, and as I
started to swim using my tail thinking I might as well grab a fish, I
suddenly felt a "presence."  
  
Dopaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!!  
"Something" rose up from directly below me at high speed and sent my
small body flying like a leaf.  
If I were bigger, I would’ve taken it head-on!  
A giant jaw visible in the water... another crocodile!?  
No, that's not it!  
"It's an alligator snapping turtle!!"  
  
It's also called a snapping turtle, and generally, I don't think it gets
bigger than one meter, but maybe in an environment without natural
enemies, it wouldn't be strange if it got bigger.  
No, that doesn't matter. Right now, I have to do something about this
ferocious carnivorous turtle that’s grown to about ten meters!  
  
I used my long tail and legs to swim quickly in the water while holding
my antler spear.  
Now, what should I do...?  
The giant alligator snapping turtle was swimming so fast that you
wouldn't think it was a turtle. I can tell intuitively that if I get
bitten by those fangs? Beak?, even with scales, it won't end well.  
I don't have enough "heat" to form wings yet, so I have to use my
weapons and somehow manage in this disadvantageous situation.  
Unsurprisingly, I can't boil the lake with my current power. Even if I
went inside it, it's questionable whether I could burn it to death.  
I have no choice... hand-to-hand combat!  
  
The moment I put my spirit into it, the skin on my arms and legs changed
into bright red scales that stood on end, and my eyes changed into
reptilian "Dragon Eyes" that brightened the murky water.  
Using my legs and tail, I charged at the giant alligator snapping turtle
approaching at high speed, holding my spear.  
For the giant turtle, I must be a long-awaited delicacy, with all my
stored "mysterious power." At the moment the giant alligator snapping
turtle was about to bite me with its jaws wide open, I spun my spear and
struck it between the eyes with the base.  
Gooooooong!!  
  
***"―――――――!"***  
The turtle howled in the water as if shrieking.  
I immediately stuck to its head and thrust my bright red claws into its
eye.  
The turtle, in pain, swung its head around trying to bite me. I put
claws on my feet and kicked its defenseless neck in an attempt to gouge
it out.  
The turtle rampaged through the water. As I was thrown off its head, I
desperately stabbed the antler spear into its giant shell.  
"—!"  
The shell wasn’t as hard as that of a normal turtle. While threatening
to be swept away, I desperately endured with the spear I stabbed.  
Even so, with the powerful technique of jumping out of the water with
momentum, my small body was sent flying into the air, where the giant
alligator snapping turtle, extending its neck, bared its fangs.  
At that moment, I widened my "Dragon Eyes" and kicked the giant head
from the side on instinct, biting down on its long, extended neck.  
  
***"Gyuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
A small wound like a scratch compared to its giant body. But the turtle
recoiled as if frightened by "something." As if it had been bitten by a
venomous snake.  
I planted my foot on the shell at the base of its neck to prevent that
from happening, and began to tear the flesh apart, chewing it.  
"Heat" flickered inside my body.  
I put that into the claws of my fingertips, stabbed them through the
wound into the giant alligator snapping turtle's brain, and burned it to
ashes.  
  
And then――  
Crack, crack.  
I'm currently turning the giant alligator snapping turtle, which I
pulled onto land, upside down and roasting it over a fire.  
How many tens of tons is this... I had to eat the heart and liver first
to lift it out of the water.  
I went through all the trouble of pulling it out of the water because I
wanted to try roasting it whole, using the turtle shell as a pot!  
It took almost a whole day to heat it through, and I finally started
eating from the abdomen side that was simmering.  
"Mm!"  
It mostly tasted like blood, but somehow it had a very rich and deep
flavor. So this is turtle...I wonder if soft-shelled turtle is tasty
too?  
After spending about half a day eating most of the innards, I cut off
the turtle's limbs that had finally been cooked through, tied them with
vines, poured "heat" into the area around my shoulder blades on my back,
and flapped my scaly wings into the sky again.  
  
"...Too much!"  
I brought the turtle's limbs as souvenirs for Jinbei, but it's hundreds
of kilograms... it might be better to count them in tons. The blood’s
been drained, so it's lighter, but even when I spewed flames from my
wings, I couldn't go faster than running on land.  
Still, because I could fly without regard for roads, it was easy to
cross the mountains. Even a distance that would take several days to
cross along roads or through forests on the ground would take less than
half a day at the speed of a car.  
As I was doing that, I saw the ruins of a building that looked like a
hospital in a deep forest.  
"...I thought it was narrow, but it's pretty wide when viewed from
above."  
Anyway, the abandoned hospital was there, and the sun is in that
direction, so...  
"It's that way!"  
It's a memory from about a year ago, but just looking at it from above
brought it back little by little.  
I could see skyscrapers in the distance. A large river in front of it. I
found something like a road buried in the ground stretching from that
direction, and finally I found a field without giant trees and a
two-story house. I can see Jinbei!  
  
Basaa――  
I flapped my wide wings and landed at a distance from the house because
I had a lot of luggage.  
Maybe because I was in a hurry, I couldn’t grasp Jinbei's "presence"
well. But the moment I tried to probe deeper, I felt a large
"presence."  
"――!"  
Right behind me! When I turned around with my spear ready, there was a
giant white wolf.  
A giant wolf that’s about five meters long... why is it in a place like
this?  
More importantly, where’s Jinbei!?  
"............"  
The giant white wolf also calmly braced itself against me. I had
transformed my eyes into those of a "Dragon" and was spreading my wings
and arching my long tail to intimidate it.  
But then――  
  
Bau.  
  
A faint... familiar "voice" came from the direction of the house, and I
couldn't help but look back. I had given myself an opening, but when I
looked, the giant white wolf was also facing that way.  
"...?"  
***"............"***  
The wolf and I just looked at each other for some reason... I was
wondering what was going on when the wolf sniffed me, exhaled as if
sighing, and pointed to the house with its chin.  
Does that mean it's not hostile? No, there's the example of Utan...  
Anyway, if Jinbei was there, let's meet him first.  
The wings crumbled with a crackling sound as scales peeled off. When I
peeked into the place where Jinbei had been sleeping, I found him there,
safe and sound.  
A reunion after a long time. But....  
"...Did you get older? No, did you dry up?"  
"Kyuun..."  
Jinbei seemed happy but also let out a pathetic cry in response to my
comment, which I blurted out absentmindedly.  
How should I say it... Did he lose weight? Because of that, he looks
old, but rather than old, he has the air of a tired middle-aged man.  
How did this happen!?  
I thought it was because of that giant white wolf, and when I looked
back, Jinbei barked again as if to stop me.  
Eh... What is it this time? Just as I was getting ready...  
  
***"Gau!"***  
As if summoned by Jinbei's voice, cries came from elsewhere, and many
wolves... dogs? Came running from the fields and the distant forest.  
Eh, no way, puppies!?  
Even though they're puppies, they're still about two meters long. The
wolf puppies, who wagged their tails innocently and ran up to me, passed
me by and jumped on Jinbei, and began to swarm him.  
"Ehh~..."  
The size difference is too big, so it just looks like a predation scene,
but what I saw through the gap was Jinbei's figure, being licked all
over with a resigned expression.  
  
***“UoooOooooooooooooon!”***  
  
At that moment, the giant white wolf howled, and the wolf puppies all
headed for it. ...Eh? Mother? Huh!?  
***"Wafn"***  
There was one puppy that didn't obey the mother wolf's voice and was
playing with my tail.  
While the other puppies had the wolf-like appearance with white or gray
fur, only that one was for some reason a fox-colored, giant "Shiba Inu"
puppy that looked exactly like Jinbei.  
Could it be...  
"Jinbei's child!?"  
"Bau..."  
Jinbei let out another pitiful noise when I shouted that and turned
around. Could it be... were you squeezed dry!?  
  
Could it be... that giant white wolf is your wife!?  
There's too much of a size difference, right!?  
No, is that not the problem...? I thought dogs don't get giant, but do
wolves get giant? Or do they grow to their original size? More
importantly, can similar species crossbreed?  
"Ummm..."  
It's been ten years since this world changed, but that giant white wolf
is quite young, right?  
Moreover, I can only judge from the fur and shape, but she's quite a
beauty, right? There are no wolves in Japan, so did she come over from
the continent?  
Why would such a beautiful and young girl choose Jinbei!?  
  
...Is this that?  
A tall and beautiful high school girl who comes to Japan on a study
abroad program from around Eastern Europe is struggling to adapt to life
in Japan and feeling down, and then a dull, small uncle in his forties
comforts and feeds her without any ulterior motives, and she falls head
over heels in love with him and carnivorously pushes him down!? What is
this, a light novel!? I've never read one though!  
How should I put this...  
"Jinbei..."  
Anyway, I gave him a thumbs up without saying anything more, and Jinbei
hid his face with his front paws as if embarrassed.  
  
"It's not much, but..."  
When I offered the large amount of meat I had brought, his wife accepted
it.  
Even though there was tons of meat, almost half is already gone because
there are so many puppies who’re in their growth spurt. Like me, can
they stockpile food?  
Jinbei is an old man, so he ate a little meat and the cabbage I picked
from the field and then he breathed a sigh of relief.  
One way or another, the puppies got used to me and we started playing.
When I threw a log as hard as I could, they all chased after it to pick
it up.  
Among them, the youngest puppy who looked like Jinbei stayed by my side
all the time, as if he had taken a liking to me.  
  
"Haaah..."  
Before I knew it, the loneliness I felt from being separated from the
children had quickly healed.  
There were a lot of shocking things, but I'm glad he seems happy. If
she's here, Jinbei won't be lonely.  
I stayed with them for several days, but I can't stay here forever.  
  
"Well then, Jinbei, everyone, take care."  
"Bau"  
"Please take good care of Jinbei."  
***"Gau"***  
Perhaps because it had become giant and smarter, the giant white wolf
nodded quietly to my words. The puppies also looked lonely, but because
they were intelligent, they listened to what their mother had to say....
but.  
"...Aren't you supposed to be over there?"  
  
Jinbei's family was seeing me off. But only the Jinbei-like puppy was
sitting next to me, looking at me while wagging his tail.  
"Jinbei..."  
"Bau..."  
When I appealed with my eyes, Jinbei looked up at his wife, and the
giant white wolf sighed again and nodded at me.  
Eh? Could it be, you're telling me to take him with me?  
"...Are you okay with that? Are you coming with me?"  
***"Wafun!!"***  
The puppy barked loudly as if it had been waiting for me to say
something.  
Maybe because he was still young, he seemed more like a dog than his
other siblings...  
Well, whatever.  
"Then, I'll give you a name? Since you're the youngest of the eight
puppies... Hachibei?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
Is that okay with you?  
He looks like Jinbei, is probably the youngest, and seems a bit
careless, so when I accidentally blurted it out, it was decided.  
  
"Okay, then let's go. See you all again! Let's go, Hachibei!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
I waved and took off running, with a huge Shiba Inu puppy running
alongside me.  
From now on, it's a journey of two!  
And from the direction of the house receding into the distance as we
departed on our journey, the howling of Jinbei's family could be heard
for a long time, as if seeing us off.
