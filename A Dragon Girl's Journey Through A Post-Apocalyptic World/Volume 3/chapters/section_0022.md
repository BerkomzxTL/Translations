# 78 The Changing World

The "Beast" was born from a transformed world.  
The tigers who had long been imprisoned in the "two-legged's" cage, were
freed and roamed from place to place, increasing the number of
companions in the same situation, and eventually became a huge pack.  
Born as one of the eldest sons within that pack, the "Beast" was
isolated due to its strangeness.  
The "Beast" was black. And it had a single "horn."  
Originally, tigers don't form packs. The reason the tigers formed packs
was because they needed the power to oppose other giant creatures, and
because they had been imprisoned in the same cage for a long time, they
were accustomed to living in pseudo-packs.  
However, the "Beast" born into this transformed world was a strong being
from birth, did not know the meaning of forming a pack, and did not need
compatriots like the adults, the weak.  
Within half a year of its birth, its physique surpassed that of an
adult, it radiated a vitality as if it would live forever, and the
"Beast" that manipulated lightning was ferocious and tyrannical.  
The pack, viewing it as dangerous, attacked, but the "Beast" countered
them all and devoured them.  
  
The "Beast" considered itself to be both an anomaly and special.  
The giant tigers of the pack were never able to sense the "mysterious
power" that filled this world until the very end, but the "Beast"
instinctively sensed that the world had been transformed by it and that
beings like itself were born.  
It was an anomaly, but not a mutation. It was inevitable that a powerful
being like the "Beast" would be born in the transformed world, and
eventually this world would be dominated by beings like the "Beast."  
  
This transformed world will be ruled by the strong. A wonderful world is
coming where individual power will rule, not numbers as before.  
But the "Beast" sensed that it was not the only strong one. Strong
beings like itself were beginning to be born all over the world. The
"Beast" manipulated lightning to emit special radio waves, and learned
that a being with great power was approaching from the north.  
The strong one coming from the north emitted a powerful "presence" that
was different from creatures that had been enlarged by mysterious power,
and from individuals that had evolved from giant creatures like
itself.  
The "Beast" considered that individual to be a wall that it must
overcome. By defeating it and devouring its heart, it should be able to
reach an even higher state of existence.  
And...  
***"Gaa..."***  
The "Beast" narrowed its eyes slightly towards the western sky.  
It sensed another powerful "presence" approaching from far away... very
far away.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"  
Spewing flames from my entire body, I charged at the Raijū, blasting
"heat" like a jet engine from the scales of my spread wings.  
***"Gaaaaa!!"***  
Purple lightning flashed from the Raijū's horn, and a bolt was released
to intercept me.  
"Taaaah!!"  
I couldn’t dodge the speed of the strike. So, without avoiding it, I
received it with the tip of my antler spear filled with "heat".  
―Crack!!  
A violent shock and lightning filled my vision. But in that instant, I
felt a "presence", and the moment I changed my posture with the recoil
of swinging my tail, the Raijū's claws, which had been approaching using
the lightning as a decoy, passed by.  
"You—!"  
Aiming for the moment it passed by, I swung my tail like a whip towards
the Raijū's face. But it saw the attack and instinctively blocked it
with its horn.  
Crack!!  
  
Flames and lightning collided and were repelled by each other. But
unlike the Raijū, which had to land on the building for a foothold, I
have wings to fly in the sky.  
Spreading my wings and forcibly staying in the air, I pointed the tip of
my wings at the Raijū, which was trying to land on the roof of the
apartment building, and spewed flames.  
Guooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!  
Concentrating the "heat" spewing out from the gaps in the scales, I shot
out fragments of the scales that were damaged when the heat erupted
along with the compressed flames.  
A barrage of flames. It’s as strong as "Dragon's Breath", and the range
is inferior. But even putting that aside, it has superior rapid-fire
capability and attack range. But―  
  
***"Gaa―"***  
The Raijū, twisting its mouth as if grinning, landed and, at the moment
my barrage landed, it jumped to the neighboring building, dodging the
flame bullets I fired after it by leaping around the rooftops like
playing leapfrog.  
***"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
The Raijū roared and released lightning over a wide area to intercept
the flame bullets.  
The released lightning and the fragments of the buildings that I had
shot scattered around, and I faintly heard the screams of Jennifer and
the others who were fighting below.  
  
"Jennifer!? Are you alright!?"  
"―I'm fine! Tsubaki, concentrate on your side!!"  
Jennifer, who was fighting a giant lioness, shouted back.  
It was relieving to know that the humans were safe for now.  
Hachibei was also down there, and the giant creatures controlled by the
Raijū were not as motivated to fight as the humans.  
More importantly, it’s not not good to make this a battlefield. It's too
close to the giant radio tower, and there are only low buildings, which
would harm the humans.  
They’re still safe for now, but my flames and the Raijū's lightning have
the potential to easily turn this area into a sea of fire if we continue
to fight.  
So what should I do!? Then―  
  
"―Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"  
The Raijū became alert and ready to move when I raised my voice. I still
raised my voice regardless and fired a flash of "Dragon's Breath".  
However, the lightning bolt prioritized speed and missed the target by a
small amount, and the Raijū snorted in contempt, easily jumping to avoid
it. However―  
"It's not over!"  
I continued to use "Dragon's Breath", swinging it horizontally in
pursuit of the Raijū that jumped away, and slammed it directly into
it.  
  
***"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
―Baaan!!  
The Raijū, noticing this, released lightning from its horn to intercept
my "Dragon's Breath".  
The force of the collision blew away the Raijū, which was in close
proximity. I took advantage of that slight gap to blast flames from my
wings and slammed into it with everything I had.  
  
Dogooooon!!  
The antler spear I thrust out was blocked by the Beast's claws, but I
didn’t care and sent the Raijū flying into the sky along with me,
leaping over the overpass we came through. What's there was―  
***"Gaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
"Fall—!!"  
Dobbboooooooooooooooooooooooooooon!  
With a huge splash, we plunged into a large river.  
  
I felt that the Raijū was more intelligent than other giant creatures.
Even so, it has a lot of combat experience and is a very troublesome
enemy, but its high intelligence is a disadvantage.  
The giant ape I fought before was the same; as their intelligence
increases, they begin to think like humans rather than following their
wild instincts.  
Because it thinks like humans, it laughed at my attacks that missed the
target, and because it has a lot of combat experience, it avoided them
with the minimum amount of effort. In its arrogance it was unaware that
I had led it in that direction.  
  
I had been aware of the river's presence ever since we arrived. The fact
that there was a stream nearby reminded me of it, so I chose that
advantageous location as the battlefield.  
Water is not my weakness. That's because what I use is "heat", not
"flames".  
Releasing "heat" from my entire body and vaporizing the surface of the
water in an instant, I slammed high-temperature steam into the Raijū as
it tried to jump out of the river.  
***"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
Of course, it didn’t damage the Raijū. But if you're a creature, it's
painful to have your lungs burned by high heat, right?  
  
"Haa!!"  
―Bakin!  
I leaped out of the river using the force of my wings, tore off the
first huge object from a building on the river's edge that caught my
eye, and threw it at it.  
Even if it's just iron or concrete, mass turns into power. The Raijū,
hearing the sound of the giant object cutting through the air in the
water vapor that blocked its vision, instinctively tried to intercept it
with lightning, but―  
Dogooooon!!  
***"Gaaaaaaaaaa!?"***  
The lightning diffused across the surface of the water, and the Raijū,
which was hit directly by the giant object, couldn't help but retreat,
jumping onto the bridge behind it.  
  
My "heat" also lost some efficiency in the water, but not enough to
reduce its power. However, the Raijū's lightning was diffused by the
impurities in the water, and it could no longer be released as lightning
because its entire body was wet.  
If that's the case, I have a chance to win! Just as I was about to jump
out to settle the score before the Raijū's entire body dried, the its
horn emitted lightning again.  
***"Gaa―"***  
The Raijū's electric shock traveled through the water on its entire body
and diffused on the surface of the river. But―  
"What..."  
Suddenly, the wavelength of the lightning emitted by the Raijū changed,
and its entire body, wet with water, dried in an instant.  
This is...  
"Electrolysis...?"  
This guy didn't use the heat of the lightning, but used electricity to
decompose the water into hydrogen and oxygen.  
  
"How troublesome..."  
***"Gaa..."***  
The Raijū grinned at me as I muttered in astonishment, and unleashed a
huge lightning strike as if to vent its frustration at the insult it had
received earlier.
