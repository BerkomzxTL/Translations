# 64 Against Humans

"...Humans?"  
A human-like figure fighting a giant lioness... And not just one. I
could see two humans fighting from here.  
"Hachibei... I'm going to try to get closer quietly. Can you be
quiet?"  
***"Wafun."***  
When I said that in a serious voice, Hachibei made a small bark with a
"determined" look.  
...I wonder if this is really okay.  
I know that it would be better to leave the puppy Hachibei behind, but I
don't know the situation. In the worst case, we might have to fight.  
I don't want to make Hachibei fight. Even as a puppy, the giant animal
Hachibei can fight to some extent, but the scariest thing is that in
this situation where I don't know anything, Hachibei might be attacked
if I leave him alone. If he's with me, I can somehow protect him.  
  
Tap, tap, tap—  
Getting out of the kei truck, and only equipped with my antler spear and
tusk knife, Hachibei and I approached, moving from one hiding place to
another.  
"...They really are fighting."  
When we got about two hundred meters closer, I could hear not only the
roar of the giant lioness but also the sounds of combat clashing.  
***"Wafun?"***  
"Hachibei, down."  
I pressed down on Hachibei's head, who was trying to peek out from the
gap in the rubble, forcing him to lie down. Hachibei looked pitiful, but
I couldn't afford to worry about that, and I couldn't really see the
situation properly.  
  
Honestly, I thought I might have been mistaken because it was so far
away. I didn't think that even a small number of humans could fight
giant animals head-on... So, if humans were being attacked by giant
animals and were running away in panic, I was thinking of helping
them.  
But I wasn't mistaken. The reason I initially thought they were
"fighting"... was because I could feel a strong "presence" from the
human-like figures.  
A strong presence that could be felt even from a distance of several
hundred meters.  
In reality, the figures, even though there were only two of them, were
fighting the giant lioness on equal terms.  
  
Daan!!  
A blow from the giant body exceeding eight meters blew the ruins apart.
Two shadowy figures dressed in black jumped out from the cloud of dust
that rose up, and immediately began attacking with spear-like weapons.  
"...What are those?"  
  
I really doubted my eyes. What are those, really? They were wearing
black clothes like some kind of special forces, with goggles, helmets,
elbow pads, knee pads, and protective gear like bulletproof vests. The
weapons looked like long swords or spears with specially shaped blades
attached to processed metal rods.  
All of them were dirty and damaged, but they were not in my
"knowledge"... They didn't exist in Japan more than ten years ago.  
And above all... the humans wielding them.  
"...Children?"  
  
I thought they looked small because of the comparison with the giant
animal. But they were clearly small. Like children... Of course, there
are small adults... women, I suppose. But once I saw them that way, they
looked like children.  
Such small humans were making fools of the giant lioness with their
incredible physical abilities, and damaging the fur of the giant animal,
which was quite tough. But...  
"—Ah!"  
Gaan!!  
A loud noise rang out, and one of the humans who had blocked the giant
lioness' claws with their spear was blown away.  
Immediately, the other human stopped the giant lioness from pursuing,
and the blown-away human staggered to their feet and challenged her
again.  
  
"............"  
...What should I do? The giant animal, covered in wounds, and the
humans, who were toying with it with their quick movements. But the
humans' weapons weren’t inflicting deep wounds, and they were gradually
being pushed back by the difference in physical strength due to their
body size.  
Should I help them, or should I watch from the sidelines...?  
If they really are children, I want to help them. But will those people
with such equipment see "me" as an ally? But...  
"...Hmm... Let's go."  
***"Wafun?"***  
Hachibei, still “lying down", barked quietly at me as I held the spear,
and I petted his head with one hand.  
Whether they are friends or foes, I'm sure I would regret it if I just
watched them die. So, I’ll act as my heart tells me.  
I made up my mind, and just as I was about to jump out—  
  
DogoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON...!!  
  
"—!?"  
Suddenly, a thunderous roar rang out, and the giant lioness' head shook
violently as if it had been blown away.  
***"GaaaAAaaaaAAAAAA!!"***  
Fresh blood splattered, and the giant lioness let out a scream of
pain.  
Sniping...? Do they have other companions? Just as I was about to jump
out, I grabbed Hachibei's scruff again and held my breath.  
The giant lioness, who had been sniped from somewhere far away, was
bleeding from one eye and writhing in pain. The two humans jumped in and
drove their spears into her neck, stabbing her repeatedly.  
***"Gao..."***  
—Thud.  
The giant lioness, having received wounds close to fatal many times, was
unable to counterattack and collapsed, bleeding from her entire body.
Near her, the two humans were finally at their limit and knelt down.
Then, another human in black appeared from the opposite side from where
I was.  
That human had an unusually bulky and long rifle with a bipod, so I
think that human was the sniper.  
"――――"  
That human called out to the two who were still unable to move, and
looked around warily... Suddenly, they pointed the muzzle of the rifle
at me.  
"—!?"  
  
DogoOON!!  
  
The human who had shot while standing without setting the rifle on the
ground fell over from the recoil. At that moment, my "Dragon's Eyes"
activated, and in the condensed time where the crumbling rubble was
slowly falling, I held Hachibei's head down and ducked.  
Bagaan!!  
The concrete wall above my head, where I was ducking, shattered.  
Why!? Why did they suddenly attack me!? Even though I was confused by
the sudden event, I held up my antler spear and jumped out, leaving
Hachibei behind.  
  
"――――!?"  
The shoulders of the human, who had fallen and was aiming the rifle at
me after I had jumped out, were shaking. Taking advantage of that gap, I
rushed up to about fifty meters away in one go, and the two people with
spears, who noticed my appearance, came forward to protect the human
with the rifle.  
"Wait! Are you all 'humans'?"  
Before I could be attacked, I shouted that, and the two with spears
looked back at the human who was still holding the rifle with perplexed
expressions. That human was probably the leader. That human took their
eyes off me, and perhaps because of that, they distorted the only
visible part of their face, their mouth, and opened it as if exhaling.  
  
"...Who the hell are you? You don't look like a normal human."  
They said that, looking at my horns and tail. The voice sounded like a
child or a young woman, high-pitched. And as I thought, they were all
quite small.  
I understand why they're suspicious. Even I can't say that I'm a "normal
human".  
"...I'm traveling to find out who I am. Can you say that you all are
normal humans?"  
"We are... humans."  
When I asked back, the leader paused for a moment and then squeezed out
a response.  
I doubt normal humans could hunt giant carnivores. But I know the
possibility that I might be able to do it.  
"If you say that you aren’t dangerous, then obediently drop your weapons
and submit to restraint."  
"...Huh?"  
While glaring at each other, the leader started saying such things.  
"...If I do that, will you guide me to your settlement?"  
"That depends on you. If you make any suspicious moves, I'll kill you.
You guys, restrain that one."  
As if refusing any discussion, they gave instructions while still
pointing the muzzle of the gun at me, and the two with spears took out
wire ropes.  
  
If all I have to do is be obedient, I don't mind being disarmed, but
there's a possibility that I'll be killed as I am.  
To be honest, I can't really trust them. Still, judging from their
equipment, these humans must be in an environment where they can use
industrial products. If so, then there must be many people. In that
case, there might be someone there who knows the current state and cause
of the world, and also about me.  
I don’t trust them, but I want to avoid hostility. But without time to
think, just as the two with spears and ropes approached, someone started
moving.  
  
***"Wafun!"***  
Seeing my crisis, Hachibei, who had jumped out, came flying towards
me.  
"A 'giant beast'!?"  
The leader raised their voice, but the two subordinates were perplexed
by the Shiba puppy, which was just big. Seeing that, the leader aimed
the muzzle of the gun at Hachibei and clicked their tongue.  
"Wait! He isn’t violent!"  
"Can I believe that! Giant beasts are the enemy!!"  
  
DogoOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!  
  
Before I could stop them, the leader shot Hachibei with the rifle.  
Crack...!!  
"Why did you shoot!"  
I cut into the line of fire and blocked it with the red scales that grew
on my arm. The scales shattered and dripped with blood, but I glared at
the leader with "Dragon Eyes", and the leader shouted.  
"So you're a companion of the giant beast! You guys, kill them!!"  
  
As if their consciousness had switched with the leader's shout, the two
attacked with murderous intent.  
I stopped the one who was trying to go to Hachibei with my antler spear.
Immediately, the other one swung their spear at me, but I avoided it by
crouching down, and swept their legs with my tail.  
DogoOON!!  
"Kuh!"  
I blocked another bullet with the scales that grew on my legs, but maybe
it's not a normal rifle, I was blown away by the impact.  
***"Wau! Wau!"***  
When Hachibei barked in threat, the muzzle of the gun was aimed at
Hachibei again.  
I won't let you do that!!  
  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"  
As I started getting up, I put "heat" into my voice to release my
"Dragon's Breath".  
The two with spears covered their ears due to the volume, and at the
instant I targeted the leader, as if to engulf those two as well—  
*'――Tsubaki-neechan――'*  
For a moment, the figures of the children overlapped with the small
humans, and I changed it to "Dragon's Roar" instead of a heat ray.  
  
"――――――――――――――――――――――――――!!"  
  
Having been selected to stand before the "Dragon," one of the people
with spears collapsed, and the other one fell to their knees. The leader
let go of the rifle and took distance by rolling, holding their head
while throwing away their helmet. That face is....  
"...A child?"  
  
Was it really a child and not a small woman?  
The girl with dull blonde hair, wet with sweat, was larger than the
others, but glared at me with an innocent face full of freckles, and
carried one of the fallen children on her shoulder.  
"Retreat! You, remember this!"  
Saying that, she gave instructions to the other one with tremendous
physical ability and retreated.  
I couldn't bring myself to pursue that fact, and could only dazedly
watch them go.
