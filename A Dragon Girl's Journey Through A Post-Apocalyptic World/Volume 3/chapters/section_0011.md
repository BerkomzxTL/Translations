# 67 Humans

***"Uuuuuuu"***  
Hachibei growled warily, and I got out of the kei truck, brandishing my
antler spear and glaring around.  
When I got out, I saw that one of the front tires of the kei truck was
completely blown out. I guess I was sniped... What am I going to do! I
don't even know if I can find a replacement tire!  
No, that's not the point right now.  
  
"...What do you intend to do?"  
When I muttered in a voice that could be heard, I could feel a slight
surprise from the adults in black who were pointing their guns at me.  
"...I'm surprised. I heard it in the report, but you really do speak
human language."  
I heard a voice like that, and a middle-aged man who appeared to be
Japanese, who was not wearing a helmet, looked at me closely while
raising one hand as if ordering those around him, "Don't shoot yet."  
  
The humans suddenly attacked us. Their equipment and actions didn't seem
like those of ordinary people or ordinary police officers.  
They were all well-built, and their guns didn't waver at all. The man
who seemed to be the leader was probably Japanese, but the skin color of
the others made it look like there were foreigners mixed in.  
They are probably... soldiers. People who made a living fighting before
this world became like this, and survived the battle with giant
beasts.  
  
"Are those horns and tail real?"  
"...They're real."  
What do you want to know? No, what do you want to say? Every time I
spoke, I could feel surprise from the people surrounding me. Hostility
and... a slight "fear" as well.  
Even though he was ordered not to shoot, one of the soldiers had his
assault rifle aimed straight at me, and I could feel the force on the
finger on the trigger.  
In that atmosphere, the middle-aged soldier who had spoken to me
continued to speak without changing his expression.  
  
"How are you controlling that giant beast?"  
"Hachibei is my friend!"  
"I see..."  
The middle-aged soldier said that emotionlessly and slightly distorted
his mouth.  
"You're a friend of the giant beast?"  
I felt the tension rise among the surrounding soldiers at that
statement.  
"We're going to take you with us. Will you be obedient?"  
I couldn't help but frown at his words.  
"...After attacking me first?"  
"It can't be helped. If you can't be obedient... we'll kill your
friend."  
  
At that moment, the scenery in my vision changed color as if dyed with
"anger".  
  
"...――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――!!!!"  
  
"Dragon's Roar"―everyone froze for a moment at the roar of selection,
and thediscussion was over. In that instant, I jumped out, holding my
antler spear, and pointed the tip at the middle-aged warrior―  
Clang!!  
"―!?"  
"I won't let you!"  
A small figure jumped out from behind him and stopped the antler spear
with a metal spear.  
  
That voice... that blonde girl!  
Her mouth was clenched, showing a desperation. From behind the girl who
was wielding her spear without thinking about the consequences, the
middle-aged soldier was pointing an assault rifle.  
―Da-da-da-da!  
Unconsciously, I kicked that girl out of the line of fire and exposed
myself to the gunfire.  
"It's not ineffective... or is it?"  
"―!"  
I stopped the bullets with the red scales I had grown on my limbs, but
the scales shattered and blood dripped down, probably because it was at
close range.  
  
"Aim for the limbs! Jennifer! Keep her pinned down!"  
"Y-yes!"  
Bullets were fired at me from the surrounding soldiers. The girl called
Jennifer stopped me from trying to evade them.  
"What are you doing!? You're getting shot too!"  
One of the stray bullets blew off her helmet, and Jennifer, with a
streak of blood running down her forehead along with her dull blonde
hair, shouted back with a tearful face.  
"I have to!!"  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Jennifer was brought into the adults' special forces, along with several
of her comrades, to capture an "Unknown" with the characteristics of a
"Dragon".  
The adults' special forces was a unit selected from the U.S. military
and the Self-Defense Forces, and were allowed to use valuable firearms
from before the world's changes without restriction. Therefore, they
were rarely deployed, and their power was only demonstrated in special
missions or when important bases were attacked.  
The reason why such a special unit, which could be said to be a
treasure, was taking children like Jennifer with them was not to make up
for their previous failure.  
  
The phenomenon of organisms growing to enormous size shattered
conventional wisdom. Not only wild animals, but also domesticated
animals and livestock grew to enormous size and their increased
intelligence caused them to bared their fangs at humans.  
Distribution stopped, fuel ran out, and food production had to rely on
manpower, and even then, many people were sacrificed by giant creatures
that attacked humans.  
The upper echelons of humanity, realizing that it was impossible to
maintain the current population, moved the entire population under the
guise of "evacuation", and carried out "selection" and "culling".  
Large corporations, the Self-Defense Forces, the U.S. military, and
their families, as well as evacuees. Their journey to establish a base
at the petrochemical complex was not an easy one. They operated power
plants and production facilities, built walls with limited resources,
and by the time they had a reasonable prospect of producing food, half
of the nearly ten thousand strong mixed army, including conscripts from
the evacuees, had been killed in battle.  
Things that used advanced technology, such as air power and tanks,
gradually decreased in number because they lacked parts even before
fuel. In the midst of a desperate situation, the walls were finally
completed, and little by little... people were able to live safe, but
minimal, lives with a lack of many things.  
As children gradually began to increase in number, "abnormalities" were
found in some of the newly born children.  
  
High physical ability. Strong body. Strong survival ability. They showed
interest in the unprocessed meat of giant beasts, which adults were
reluctant to eat, and what adults feared most was their lack of
hesitation to take lives.  
About 20% of the total showed abnormalities. The leaders of the base,
realizing that the higher the probability of them being born, the more
severe the environment was, proposed moving the mothers to a less
stressful environment, but even then, abnormal children were being
born.  
And then an incident occurred. Several children aged eight to ten who
tried to bully a three-year-old infant were half-killed, and it began to
be thought that children born after the world's changes were not the
same "species" as humans before.  
The adults feared the new children.  
The fear that they, the "old humanity", might be driven out by the
children, the "new humanity".  
Just as non-predators instinctively fear predators, the terrifying
existence of giant beasts destroyed the adults' rationality and common
sense and they rejected the path of "coexistence".  
  
The children were isolated. Expulsion or extermination. As the adults,
who had lost their mental composure, were about to make a decision to
take a heartless choice, the upper echelons of the military overturned
it.  
They proposed to the leaders that the children who had transformed in
the same way as the giant beasts be used to replenish thedepleted
military force due to the giant beasts.  
Even so, most parents instinctively feared them as a "different species"
and resisted giving them up. However, as they grew older, they became
too much to handle, and nearly 100 children, including orphans of
soldiers, were subjected to "education" to make use of their
abilities.  
  
Jennifer and the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit were older children
who had completed special training from among the children born after
the world's changes.  
Jennifer had been participating in combat as a member of the first Giant
Beast Countermeasures Unit since she was seven years old, and will be
ten years old this year. There were seven other children of the same age
in her class, but due to inadequacies in operations and equipment in the
early stages, Jennifer was the only one left now.  
The adults decided to use "medicine" as a way to strengthen their mental
state, believing that the reason for this was fear based on reason.  
  
As the only surviving "sister", Jennifer could not afford to fail her
mission. If she were to abandon or fail her mission, the younger
children, whose egos had been weakened by the drugs and who were no
longer able to express emotions, would fall into even greater hell.  
  
"I have to!!"  
A girl with horns and a tail, unlike ordinary humans. Jennifer, who had
defeated many giant beasts, had to retreat and abandon her weapons in
order to save her comrades.  
If she made any more mistakes, the adults would reduce the supply of
drugs. She didn't know if she herself could endure it, let alone the
younger children who were mentally ill.  
That's why she had to accomplish this new mission.  
That mission was to lure the "girl" so that the adults could safely
neutralize her.  
  
Scales that could withstand rifle bullets from close range, and a roar
that could shatter minds. She felt the same kind of "strength" as a
giant beast in the "girl", who was about the same age as Jennifer.  
If she didn't hold her back, the "girl" would defeat even the adults.
That's why, if she accomplished the mission, she could show that she was
a necessary presence at the base.  
A hateful being that had driven them into a corner and forced them to
retreat. And yet――  
  
"Why... are you making such a face?"  
The "girl" who was deflecting Jennifer's spear with a crude spear while
being exposed to the adults' bullets was looking at Jennifer with a face
she had never seen before.  
No, she had seen it a few times. Pity. Sympathy. Sorrow... but those
were emotions from above, from the adults, to save their own hearts, and
no one helped them.  
But the "girl's" eyes didn't seem to be looking down from above, but
from the same point of view, and it seemed to Jennifer that her hand was
offering help.  
(...There's no way!)  
  
"Second squad, fire!"  
Jennifer heard that voice from behind, and at the same time she jumped
away, a sleeping gas bullet was fired.  
But the "girl" also jumped away at that moment, and it misfired, and she
was glared at by the squad leader.  
"There's no other way.. You guys go too!"  
At that order, the younger children who had been waiting took up their
spears and jumped out.  
(I can't let them!)  
In the current situation, even Jennifer, who had a will, could not dodge
all the bullets, and some of them had grazed her. In that situation, the
younger children might die... the moment she thought that, Jennifer
threw away her spear and jumped on the "girl".  
"Fire!!"  
The squad leader didn't miss the opportunity and ordered, and several
bullets grazed Jennifer...  
"No!!"  
The "girl", who had taken the brunt of most of the bullets as a shield,
was blown away.  
  
At that moment, a sleeping gas bullet was fired at the "girl", and she
collapsed with serious injuries.  
"Hachibei! Run!!"  
At that last scream, the dog-like giant beast, who had also been hit by
bullets, showed a moment of hesitation, but immediately seemed to sense
something and left.  
  
"Restrain her!"  
The "girl" was being taken away, unconscious and covered in blood, under
heavy restraint.  
One of the adults threw the retrieved rifle back to Jennifer, who was
stunned and not being treated, and Jennifer picked up the remaining
crude spear and muttered with a tearful face.  
"...Why did you save me?"
