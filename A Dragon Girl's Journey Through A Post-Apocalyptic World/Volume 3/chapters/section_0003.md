# 59 The Smell Of Coffee

Hachibei and I were heading south. We've been following a town along a
large river, but to be precise, there's a national highway along the
river, and the town was along that road.  
I'm calling it a town, there's nothing here. Is it more like a village
than a town? There are houses scattered along the road, perhaps
farmhouses, but the town itself isn't particularly ruined.  
Still, there are some houses that are destroyed...  
"Hachibei, did you get any?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
When I called out, Hachibei, who had poked his head out of the tall
prairie, brought over the vegetables he had pulled up.  
  
Apparently, there used to be rice paddies around here, so it hasn't been
overtaken by nature. The houses around here are probably farmhouses, and
in the garden of one of the broken-down houses, there were traces of a
vegetable garden.  
I guess they were attacked by giant herbivorous animals. I don't know if
it was deer or a boar, but naturally, since they're that size, their
eating style is rough, so the vegetables they scattered while eating had
grown wild in the surrounding area.  
  
Since Hachibei is Jinbei’s son, he also likes vegetables.  
Carrots, onions, radishes, komatsuna¹ , and spinach. They can be eaten
raw, so today I just washed them in the irrigation ditch and munched
down on them with Hachibei.  
"Are you okay with onions?"  
***"Wafun..."***  
He's eating them normally, so it seems he's okay because his body is
big. But he didn’t like the taste. It seems he doesn't like spicy
things... or maybe he just has a child's palate.  
  
As we continued on, the number of buildings gradually decreased.  
There were grasslands that used to be rice paddies, but the only
buildings along the road were factory-like. Occasionally there were
convenience store-like buildings, but among them, there was one building
that seemed out of place.  
"...A coffee shop?"  
***"Wafun?"***  
It felt more like a café than a coffee shop. The walls, which used to be
white, had become a dull color. The surroundings were covered in grass,
but the glass wasn't broken, and the inside seemed to be as it was.  
White walls and a white ceiling. Dark wood-grained tables and stylish
sofas...  
I kind of want to go in... But my rules don't allow me to go into locked
houses.  
Crack.  
***"Wafun!"***  
"Hachibei-chan..."  
While I was lost in thought, Hachibei seemed to have entered from the
back. The door was unlocked, wasn't it? You didn't break it, did you?
Probably. Well, it doesn't look like anyone was living there, so it's
okay. I guess.  
  
"Excuse me..."  
I removed the broken back door and went inside. There was no light, but
since the shop itself was small, but it didn't feel dark because there
was light coming in from outside.  
"Hachibei?"  
***"Wafun."***  
Hachibei was already relaxing on the biggest sofa. The inside of the
shop is quite dusty, but it's no different from lying down outside.  
We can stay here for the night. Fortunately, we still have the frogs we
caught in the irrigation canal, and some vegetables left. Still, I
looked around to see if there was any food left, but everything that
looked like food had turned to dirt in the refrigerator.  
  
"...Hm?"  
When I took out what I found in the cupboard, it looked like coffee
beans. It seems this shop used to buy canned beans and ground them
in-store. Just in case, I opened the can, and a pungent, sour smell made
me close the lid without thinking.  
...Well, I guess that's how it is. I thought that as I put it back, but
hmm?  
I found a strange bag. I wonder what it is? When I shook it, it seemed
to contain beans too.  
I was curious for some reason, so I opened it and found dried, raw
coffee beans that hadn't been roasted yet.  
They didn't smell moldy, and they weren't discolored either. Could this
be... can I drink them?  
  
I can only say that I had a vague feeling about it. I thought I might
have a chance to drink coffee, which I only know about from my
"knowledge".  
I looked around the shop and found tools for grinding beans, but it
seems like they made coffee with something like an espresso machine. As
I was wondering what to do, "knowledge" came to my mind.  
"...I'll boil it."  
Leaving things that won't be used in a shop like this, there must have
been someone with particular tastes, like the manager or the owner. It's
been more than ten years since then, and I don't know if they're still
alive, but since it's here, I've decided to do my best to drink it.  
  
As I was about to go outside to collect firewood, I suddenly thought of
something. I sat down on the floor inside the shop, put the beans in a
frying pan I borrowed from the shop, and started roasting them from
below with the "heat" of my palm.  
***"...Wafun?"***  
As I shook the frying pan with my palm, the color of the beans gradually
changed, and Hachibei, who had been napping, woke up to the fragrant
smell.  
"It's hot, so don't play around."  
***"Kyuun."***  
My "heat" isn't that easy to control, but I focused it from my palm to
my fingertips and quickly moved my hands to evenly heat the beans.  
Maybe I should roast them darker since they might be oxidized? Well, as
long as they turn a nice color it's fine.  
I cooled the roasted beans and put them in the machine to grind them. I
turned the handle at a human pace to grind the beans into powder, put
them in a copper cup I also found in the shop, and poured water over
them.  
  
***"Wafun?"***  
Hachibei sniffed the water with powder floating in it with interest. I
grinned at him and put "heat" into the hand holding the bottom of the
cup. Steam gradually rose, and it began to bubble.  
Does it get bitter if you do too much? I stopped the "heat" at an
appropriate point, put the cup on the floor, and waited a bit. Hachibei
tilted his head as if asking, "Aren't you going to drink it?" With a
"wait" gesture, I waited for about as long as it took for the grounds to
settle, then took a sip of the fragrant coffee.  
―Buho!  
"Awful!"  
  
Apparently, I didn't roast them enough, the grinding was too rough, or I
added too much heat, so it was very bitter.  
Hachibei, who was in front of me when I spat it out, yelped and
protested.  
"No, sorry."  
***"Kyuun."***  
Hachibei looked pitiful as he wiped his brown face with his front
paws.  
That's strange... The aroma was so good.  
Thus, my first coffee experience became a literally bitter one. Oh well.
I'll take all the unroasted beans with me.  
While I was doing various things, it had become completely dark, so I
decided to eat and stay the night... leaving the half-finished coffee as
it was.  
  
***"Gueeeee!"***  
Crash!!  
"Huh?!"  
***"Kyan!?"***  
The next morning, just as the sun was starting to rise, I was suddenly
awakened by a strange cry and the sound of destruction.  
The coffee shop was being destroyed. A giant shadow covered the
ultramarine sky. I immediately grabbed Hachibei by the scruff of his
neck, jumped out of the collapsing building, and saw the identity of the
attacker.  
***"Guee!"***  
A giant with a height of nearly ten meters. Unusually long legs and
neck. The creature, which had spread wings that were not so big for its
giant body, didn't even glance at us as we jumped out. It just kept
pecking at the coffee shop with its beak.  
"...An ostrich?"  
  
Another zoo situation?! Or was there an ostrich farm nearby?!  
***"Wafun!"***  
Unlike me, who was being cautious, Hachibei didn't seem to see the giant
ostrich as an "enemy". He didn't seem to be letting his guard down,
but... I certainly didn't feel any hostility? Is that why I didn't wake
up from the "presence"?  
***"Gueeeeeee"***  
The giant ostrich, apparently satisfied after pecking quite a bit,
stared at something with a "serious" expression, let out a cry, and
started running off with its wings flapping as if to fly.  
...In the end, it didn't even notice our existence.  
  
I slumped my shoulders in exhaustion at the strange behavior of the
giant creature.  
"...I don't know."  
***"Wafun."***  
And yet, somehow Hachibei seemed to be having fun.
