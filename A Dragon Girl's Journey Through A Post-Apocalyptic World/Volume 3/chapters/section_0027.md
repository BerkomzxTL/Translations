# 83 Unexpected Companion

Mount Fuji could be seen in the distance... We witnessed an object
resembling a "Dragon" descending from the sky onto its summit.  
"......It's not confirmed yet, though."  
"Yeah."  
I nodded to Yaeko's words, who muttered that without even noticing that
her cigarette had fallen from her lips.  
  
......It's not definite. Probably a few days or weeks ago, a dragon that
destroyed a U.S. military outpost and flew from the continent headed
east... towards Japan. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the shadow
that appeared here is that dragon.  
It might be a type of monster bird like that Raijū, or an artificial
satellite might have fallen from the stratosphere. ...But, both Yaeko
and I didn't think so, and somewhere in our hearts we were convinced
that it was a dragon.  
  
The shock we felt earlier, like an explosion that could be mistaken for
an earthquake.  
That was the dragon's "roar."  
  
"Anyway, I'm going to report this to the higher-ups. Tsubaki-chan, don't
you dare go wandering off on your own!"  
"Yeah, okay. I understand."  
When I obediently nodded, Yaeko, looking dissatisfied, stomped out her
fallen cigarette with her sandal―  
"You really can't go anywhere! I'm not kidding!"  
"Yes, yes."  
Yaeko, walking away while turning back and pointing her finger, warned
me, and I waved back with a wry smile, seeing her off. ...I hope she
doesn't fall down the stairs.  
  
After that, it was quite a commotion. The refugees were anxious about
the shock, but not only me and Yaeko, but also other people witnessed
something like a giant bird descending on the summit of Mount Fuji.  
The general public had restricted access to information, so no one
thought it was a dragon, but depending on how it moves from now on, the
situation will change.  
If it’s confirmed that it’s a dragon, some people will feel uneasy about
my existence, since I’m also a "dragon." If that happens, I don't know
what will happen to this evacuation center that’s finally coming
together.  
  
"Tsubaki!"  
When I returned to the children's dormitory, Jennifer and the others,
who had been ordered to stand by, practically jumped on me.  
"What happened!? What was that...?"  
"Hmm, I'm not sure yet. Yaeko is reporting to the higher-ups, so we're
waiting for that."  
"I see..."  
The children, looking uneasy at my evasive words, gathered around me
again.  
...After all, these kids understand.  
  
"......Tsubaki-chan."  
The next day, Yaeko appeared with even darker circles under her eyes and
took me outside.  
"The upper management is divided in their opinions, but the consensus is
that it's probably what we expect."  
"I figured."  
"By any chance, are you sure, Tsubaki-chan?"  
"Probably...but."  
  
From the moment I saw that figure, something stirred within me. Whether
it was my blood telling me so, I felt like that was "the same" as me.  
It's probably not a coincidence that it started moving, and that its
direction was Japan.  
The trigger was a few weeks ago... When I was imprisoned here and woke
up, the dragon on the continent sensed my presence and came towards
"me."  
It's probably not coming directly here because it doesn't know the exact
location, but it's probably luring me.  
It raised a dragon’s "selection", and set up camp on the highest
mountain in this country, asking all who have the courage to come to
it.  
"......So you've already decided."  
"Yeah. I think I have to go."  
I nodded deeply at Yaeko, who said that with a somewhat resigned tone.  
  
I decided to leave the next morning. Yaeko said she would prepare the
equipment and necessities by then, and when I returned to the dormitory
after parting with her, the children with knowing looks were waiting for
me.  
"......Are you leaving?"  
After all, the children had sensed that I was leaving this place. That's
why they had been by my side for the past few days.  
"I'll do my best to come back..."  
I can't promise anything. But I don't want to lie. The children were
upset by my sincerity, but they didn't try to stop me.  
We all ate together that day, and we all slept together as a group  
I wanted to say a lot of things, like study hard, or protect your place,
but saying such things would be like saying goodbye, so I couldn't say
anything in the end.  
  
"Tsubaki-chan, I've prepared everything. It's the bare minimum, though.
And this too."  
"Huh? Thanks."  
And the next morning. As I was about to depart after receiving spare
equipment and food from Yaeko, the children, the people from the
research institute, and the special forces came to see me off...  
***"Wafun."***  
"Hachibei..."  
Hachibei, who I thought would be staying here, was standing next to
me.  
"Listen..."  
***"Wafun!"***  
When I was about to try and persuade him, I couldn't say anything to
Hachibei, who was looking at me with sparkling, round eyes. I could
manage a sigh.  
"......Are you coming with me?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
Well, ......I guess it can't be helped.  
"Hachibei...make sure you come back, okay?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
The children clung to Hachibei, who had grown quite a bit and was almost
an adult dog.  
...I feel like he's missed more than I am.  
"You too, Tsubaki!"  
"Yeah, thanks Jennifer."  
When I stroked Jennifer's head, who was next to me, her face turned
bright red... but she didn't shake my hand off.  
  
"Then, let's go!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
―Brrun! The engine started and we departed.  
I had previously asked Yaeko to recover the kei truck that we had used,
so she had prepared that as well.  
I thought that the kei truck would be fine after being left for a few
weeks, but it seems that it was in a pretty precarious state, so Yaeko
and the others had fully serviced it and loaded new gasoline onto the
truck bed.  
But you’re out, Hachibei. You're too big to ride in the truck bed.  
  
"What a nice breeze."  
***"Wafun!"***  
Hachibei, who was running next to the kei truck, responded to my
mutterings.  
Although he had been running around with the children and humans, he
seems to have been consciously holding back because fragile humans were
nearby. He seemed happy to be able to exert his full power for the first
time in a while.  
"............"  
Even though I'm going to another "dragon's" place, I'm being quite
leisurely. If I really wanted to get there, I could just fly.  
I had a conviction that something irreversible would happen. That's why
I thought I should cherish this time touring the current world.  
  
We didn't head towards Tokyo, but instead headed south along the road. I
was told that there were fewer abandoned cars and less damage that way,
making it easier to drive.  
Many buildings were swallowed up by trees, but many were also safe. We
borrowed a safe house that day and camped out, just Hachibei and me for
the first time in a while.  
Are we taking too long...? Well, whatever.  
  
And the next day, we smoothly reached the prefectural border... or maybe
that's not quite right. This is...  
"It's a big bridge."  
***"Wafun!!"***  
Hachibei barked excitedly at the long bridge crossing the sea that he
was seeing for the first time.  
I heard at the evacuation center that this bridge was still intact. I
figured it had been destroyed by giant tuna or giant whales, but this
will allow us to take a big shortcut.  
When I was about to cross the bridge thinking that, I witnessed
something unbelievable.  
"Hachibei..."  
***"Kyuu~n..."***  
Hachibei let out a troubled noise. There was...  
  
"Yo, I've been waiting. Won’tcha give me a ride?"  
  
A girl with black hair and a sailor uniform, who I had seen somewhere
before many times. She was standing at the entrance of the bridge with
her thumb out as if she was hitchhiking.  
...What is going on!?
