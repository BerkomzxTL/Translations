# 82 A Visitor

The "Dragon" previously spotted by US military reconnaissance aircraft
had begun to move.  
"…For now, we're returning to base. Everyone, start preparing to
withdraw!"  
The dragon is moving... and there's a high possibility its path will
lead to Japan. However, we don't have any more information than that, so
we decided to return to base, the shelter.  
  
"…Is a dragon coming?"  
"Looks like it…"  
I gave Jennifer, who was looking uneasy, a vague answer and gently
patted her head.  
I think it's a good thing that these kids, who weren’t able to rely on
adults, have learned to rely on someone.  
I heard from Yaeko that some of the higher-ups were worried that the
children, who have started to behave like typical children, will make it
difficult to maintain unit cohesion. But in my opinion, that's not the
case.  
Humans aren't machines. I believe that the strength of the heart is
important for emotional beings to exert their power.  
  
After that, I unloaded the bulky and heavy items first. I'm fine even if
I jump down from above.  
After that, there was an incident where Hachibei, thinking he was going
to be left behind, jumped down though I hurriedly caught him. After
spending another whole day descending from the radio tower, we joined up
with the unit on the first floor and started our return to the
shelter.  
  
When we moved to the city center, there was a sense of tension because
we didn't know when we would be attacked, but there was also a sense of
anticipation that something would change. But on the way back, that
anticipation turned into anxiety, and naturally, we spoke less. Of
course, Hachibei, who had been running around when we came, was reading
the atmosphere…  
***"Wafun!"***  
Ah, that's right. Running is fun, isn't it?  
Whether he understands or not, Hachibei, who probably doesn't understand
human weakness, seems to think that if he has energy, everything will be
alright.  
Perhaps the sight of a big Shiba Inu running around had an animal
therapy effect, because the atmosphere lightened considerably by the
time we finally arrived at the shelter.  
  
"Tsubaki, the captain is going to report to the higher-ups, so we're on
standby."  
"Understood."  
***"Wafun!"***  
Jennifer told me this after speaking with the special forces captain.  
As soon as Hachibei returned, the children in the shelter who had been
waiting for him ambushed and clung to him.  
"Do your best, Hachibei!"  
***"Kyuun…"***  
As expected, Hachibei seems to understand that ordinary children are
small and weak, and he had a pathetic look on his face as he was unable
to move.  
He's just a big stuffed animal, so it can't be helped. Give up.  
  
As for me, I was overseeing the children's studies, which had been
lagging a bit.  
Well, I think they can proceed on their own once they've learned the
alphabet, but all the children from the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit
were gathered around me in a huddle.  
"…Isn't it cramped?"  
***"We're okay."***  
It's a bit scary when everyone responds like that.  
But I can understand their feelings a little…  
I somehow understood it too. The children, who were sensitive to the
atmosphere, clung to me.  
As we were doing that, a few days later, a young soldier came to call
me. It seems they have something to say to me alone, without the
children.  
But it's rare for the higher-ups, who haven't tried to meet with me
directly, to summon me. As I was thinking that, I realized it's not the
corporate building in the back, but the place where me and the children
got our equipment.  
  
"Oh my, the young dragon lady's back? Here, take this!"  
"Thanks!"  
On the way to my destination, I received a carrot from the old woman at
a stall. It had been washed, so I bit into it like a fruit and crunched
it, and the old woman smiled.  
There are still many people who have an aversion to me, but the people
near the gate, where the damage was severe, have accepted me.  
Hachibei, with his lovable appearance and behavior, has become popular,
especially among people who used to have dogs and children.  
…He's really just a big dog.  
But what will happen to these people if they find out what's happening
now…?  
  
"Well, well. Welcome, Tsubaki-chan. Make yourself at home."  
"Yaeko?"  
Waiting for me there was Yaeko, who is in the department that develops
equipment and is in charge of me and the children.  
"Where is everyone else?"  
"It's just me."  
As I watched Yaeko open the window all the way in the room that seemed
to have been hastily prepared, taking a deep drag and exhaling the smoke
from her cigarette, I was suddenly reminded of something.  
"Ah, I forgot to bring back cigarettes."  
"What did you say!?"  
She seemed to have been really looking forward to it. Yaeko slumped her
shoulders in disappointment.  
"If they remember, one of the children will bring them."  
"Really…?"  
I don't know.  
  
"So listen, the reason I called you, Tsubaki-chan, is to convey the
higher-ups' views. Well, it's a silly story, so you don't have to take
it seriously."  
"Yaeko…"  
Somehow, Yaeko seemed angry. I felt like she was smoking more cigarettes
than last time, which may have been because the children weren't there,
but also because she was irritated by what the higher-ups had said.  
"So basically…"  
  
With the equipment brought back from the radio tower, a simple
long-distance communication system was completed.  
It seems that communication is only possible when the orbit and position
of the still-functioning artificial satellite is aligned, but the
higher-ups believe that the same message is still being broadcast from
the US military outpost, meaning they either retreated or were
annihilated.  
  
"We still can't get in touch with the United States. It's hard to
believe they've been wiped out, but that's making the higher-ups
anxious."  
"…………"  
  
A mysterious existence discovered on the continent—a "Dragon."  
Its ecology and purpose were unknown, but the outpost set up to monitor
it, which had been sitting passively, was destroyed, and the dragon flew
off somewhere.  
Its path is towards Japan, and some of the higher-ups are worried that
the reason for this is because I, another "Dragon," am here.  
"They might say something, but don't worry about it? If it really comes,
you're the only one who can do anything about it, Tsubaki-chan. It's
pathetic as adults, though."  
So saying, Yaeko lit another cigarette.  
  
The "Dragon (threat)" is coming because the "Dragon (me)" is here.  
There may be those who try to eliminate me because of that idea.  
But… maybe. That idea might be correct. If there's another being like
me, I'd want to go meet them, too.  
Sensing that I might disappear, the children were also feeling
anxious.  
Right now, the "Dragon's" movements are unknown. I thought we'd be
waiting for information for a while, when suddenly a trembling shock hit
us.  
  
――――――――…!!  
  
"W-What? An earthquake? An explosion?"  
"I don't know, but… I'm going upstairs!"  
In terms of sensation, it's closer to an explosion than an earthquake.
But if it's an explosion, it would be on a massive scale.  
Yaeko followed me as I headed to the roof to grasp the situation. I
picked up Yaeko, who started to run out of breath after a few meters,
and headed to the roof, where—  
"That’s…"  
"Mount Fuji?"  
  
Because the air was clear, we could see a high mountain in the distance…
and at its center, near the crater at the summit, we saw a black
bird-like silhouette descend from the sky.  
Could that be…?  
  
"Dragon…?"
