# 85 Anticipated Encounter

"Alrighty, off we go!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
"...Right."  
The morning after staying at a deserted hot spring inn, we departed.  
...I have some thoughts about Hachibei, who has been completely tamed to
some extent. So greedy.  
  
Nothing happened at the hot spring inn. We looked for decent rooms that
weren't being eroded by trees and moisture, and the yeti shared some
wild yams with us during meals, but really, nothing happened.  
That yeti was quite intelligent and didn't actively try to interact with
us, but it didn't have the twisted attachment to humans like Utan, and
it showed tolerance by scolding the overly noisy Hachibei and sharing a
giant deer's femur with him.  
By the way, it seems it learned to read and write from books and
magazines left at the hot spring inn. Therefore, it couldn't understand
Japanese and could only communicate through writing.  
It was really smart....  
***"Kyuuun..."***  
Maybe Hachibei should study...?  
  
Anyway, as Tamachii said, the yeti was clearly different from other
giant creatures.  
What’s the difference...? Hachibei, his siblings and his giant wolf
parent. All of them are second-generation individuals, giant animals
that gained "mysterious power" that invaded this world more than ten
years ago.  
And the Raijū, the yeti... Mutants born from giant creatures. But their
ways of being are so different that you could say they are opposites.  
The Raijū recognized its own power, sensed that other mutants would be a
threat, and schemed to become a strongman in a new world, but the yeti,
with its high intelligence, saw no meaning in fighting and wanted to
live peacefully.  
They like to fight, and they want peace. It's like...  
  
"Like a 'human'?"  
"............"  
  
It was as if she had read my mind, and I couldn't help but shoot
Tamachii a suspicious look.  
No, she's probably reading it... I decided not to point it out, so I
won't say anything.  
  
"What do you want, Tamachii?"  
"I wanna be with Hanatsubaki-chan."  
I really want to know who she "really" is, but I don't think she'll tell
me. So when I asked a deliberately vague question, Tamachii smiled and
said that.  
Then...  
"What do you want me to do?"  
Tamachii smiled with her eyes narrowed at my question.  
"I just want you to choose."  
"............"  
  
What does she want "me" to choose...?  
I thought about myself again. I was alone since I was born, so I had
never cared about it, but after meeting Jinbei and Granny, fighting
various giant creatures, and interacting with the humans trying to live
in this world, I understood that I am "different" in this world.  
I have a form close to that of a human, and I think in a way close to
that of a human, but my essence is not "human."  
My thoughts are close to those of humans, so I act in a human-like
manner, but even though I feel that humans are friends and close to me,
I realized once again that I had never thought of humans as
"comrades."  
  
I am a "dragon."  
It may sound arrogant to say this, but to me all the living things
standing before me are equal in all respects, with no hierarchy.  
I became friends with the people in the shelter, but if they had
continued to persecute Jennifer and the others at that time, I wouldn’t
have protected that place.  
  
I was a true foreign object in this world... the only "dragon" ―  
But then another "dragon" appeared.  
I'm going to meet that being. There... I will have to make some kind of
"choice."  
  
"Super cool, an ostrich."  
Hearing the voice from the passenger seat, I looked out the window on
that side and saw a giant ostrich that looked familiar running wildly
across the prairie, and for a moment it noticed us... ah, it fell off a
cliff.  
"Ahaha, what a cutie."  
"Ah, yeah."  
I can't seem to get serious...  
A few days passed.  
  
―Burun.  
"This is it?"  
"Right."  
Mount Fuji's fifth station. Ten days after our departure, we were able
to come this far without any delays, thanks to the road still having
asphalt due to the high altitude.  
Well, the reason it was going smoothly was because Tamachii *somehow*
directed me away from the roads that were crushed by landslides and
rockfalls, and told us the proper route, but from here on out, we have
to walk up the mountain on our own two feet, not with the kei truck.  
"...Is it still no good if I fly there alone?"  
***"Wafun!?"***  
When I asked, just to see what would happen, Hachibei made a face that
said, ‘Now you ask?!’  
"Ahaha, if we've come this far let's all go together."  
  
Well, I guess it can't be helped. I'm sure Tamachii will be fine even if
I leave her alone, but I wanted to leave Hachibei behind.  
"............"  
I looked up at the summit from the fifth station. I can't see anything
there, but I know. ...It's there. An existence of the same kind as me.  
I can feel the "presence" of an existence whose source is the same, even
though its shape is completely different.  
It must have noticed me too. Surely... no, almost certainly, that
"dragon" was drawn to me, a "dragon," and came all the way here.  
And just as we were about to head for the summit―  
"...An earthquake?"  
A slight tremor felt from under my feet.  
"Aww, they just couldn't wait, huh."  
That means....  
  
―Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!  
  
The atmosphere trembled from the sudden "roar," the leaves of the trees
that had begun to change color scattered, and Hachibei tucked his tail
and hid behind me.  
Next to Tamachii, who never stopped smiling in the midst of it all, I
stared at the summit of Mount Fuji.  
"...Coming."  
The moment I muttered that, something like a jet-black bird burst out of
the crater of Mount Fuji, tore through the clouds in the sky and landed,
blowing away the fallen leaves and soil of the parking lot that could
probably fit 500 cars.  
  
The total length, including the tail, was about 40 meters. The wings,
which were spewing that mysterious power while flying, would be over 50
meters wide if spread out horizontally.  
Scales covering its entire body, sharp black claws and fangs, six
twisted black horns, and familiar golden dragon eyes that were looking
at me.  
After staring at each other for a while as if confirming each other, the
black dragon quietly opened its mouth.  
  
***"――At long last, I have the honor of meeting you. O ‘dragon’ of this
world ――"***  
  
Although his words were slightly difficult to understand, as air seemed
to leak out from the space in his jaw, I could feel a definite
intelligence and rationality in his words.  
But... the unease didn’t go away. It didn't seem like it would suddenly
turn into a fight, but even so, the moment I saw the Black Dragon, I
felt flames rising within me. And...  
"...'This world'?"  
The Black Dragon certainly said that. This world... so it's as if there
is another world.  
Out of the corner of my eye, Tamachii's smile deepened. And the Black
Dragon, hearing my mutter, spoke again.  
  
***"――I am Waleum, the Dragon of Darkness. From the other world, Mundus,
I have come to do battle with the ‘Fire Dragon’ of this world ――"***
