# 65 New Humanity

"……Hachibei, are you okay?"  
***"Wafun..."***  
When I called out to him, Hachibei worriedly licked the wound on my leg
where I was shot.  
The sniper rifle bullet I took at close range had a considerable impact,
with enough power to shatter my red scales. Even so, it didn't
penetrate, and no bones were broken. Even now, new scales were cracking
and covering the wound like a scab, and regeneration has begun.  
"……This is"  
The rifle that the blonde girl abandoned to help her companions was left
on the ground.  
When I picked it up, I noticed that it was quite large and heavy. If
this size rifle has that much power, then I think I could deflect
bullets of a smaller caliber with my scales.  
  
"That way……huh"  
I turned my eyes in the direction the children went, narrowing my eyes
while looking into the distance.  
They might have simply wanted to get away from here, but they may have
unconsciously retreated towards their "base." Especially if they are
still "children."  
"Children……"  
The faces of Aki and Rin appeared in my mind, overlapping with those
children. They were probably……the same as Aki and the others.  
Children born after the world became like this eleven years ago.  
Humans haven’t become giant creatures even if their bodies were large. I
thought the reason for this was their original intelligence and
rationality, but are those children the form of that "evolution"?  
  
When I thought about it that way, an unpleasant assumption came to
mind...  
Not all creatures in this world have become giant. Medium-sized
creatures like rabbits and dogs, and aquatic creatures like fish, frogs,
and crayfish, haven’t grown.  
I had previously thought that the reason there were few medium-sized
creatures was that they had become food for the giant creatures. But if
that's the case, why haven't creatures like mice and insects
proliferated?  
I thought that the number of small creatures had decreased because the
winters became colder, but perhaps all the creatures in this "world"
were being "selected" in the same way as my roar.  
The result is the "gigantification" of creatures with a certain size or
more.  
The result is probably the "enhancement" of newly born humans, isn't
it?  
"……How disgusting"  
It almost feels as if it's being done "intentionally," which is
disturbing.  
The fact that there were no children older than Aki in that group makes
me feel uneasy. It's possible that families with children evacuated
earlier, but……either way, I feel like I could get some "answers" if I
went to the blonde girl's base.  
"Hachibei, I'm going to look for something."  
To do that, there’s something I need first. As I was about to move,
thinking that, Hachibei stopped me by biting my fur.  
***"Wafun!"***  
"……Oh, food first, huh?"  
Following Hachibei's gaze, I saw the giant female lion that had just
been killed lying there.  
  
The meat of carnivores is smelly. The smell of what they eat transfers
directly to their own meat.  
"……I don't smell bad, do I?"  
***"Wafun?"***  
I asked this while I took the heart and liver and Hachibei ate the rest,
and Hachibei tilted his head with his mouth covered in red. Quite
macabre.  
I see, you don't know. Hachibei and I like vegetables too, so we don't
smell bad, right? Hina, Riku, and Sora often hugged me, so I'm sure I
have a floral scent.  
  
After eating most of the giant creature's meat, my wounds healed and the
scales crumbled off. The meat of the lioness smelled bad, but I feel
like my strength has increased a little.  
"Okay, I'm done, so let's go."  
***"Wafun!"***  
It's not a walk, okay? You don't understand, do you... I put the
remaining meat, which I drained as much blood from as possible, into
several plastic bags and set off.  
"Ah, let's take this too."  
***"Wafuuu"***  
When I picked up the rifle, Hachibei made a slightly unpleasant face,
understanding that it was the weapon that hurt me. It's okay, I'm not
going to use it. I don't even know if there are any bullets left, and
besides…….  
"My 'Dragon Breath' is stronger!"  
Saying that, I puffed out my chest.  
***"Wafuuu……"***  
Why are you making such a disappointed face!?  
  
What I'm looking for is a map. I've been traveling while looking at maps
that I’ve found in elementary schools and other places, but they've just
been for studying geography, and they didn’t have much detail and they
weren’t very accurate.  
I'm looking for a map that shows the main buildings. Before the world
became like this, it was easy to check the geography on computers and
smartphones, so there aren't many left on paper.  
That's why I'm looking for a police box. But…….  
"Ummm"  
I found a police box right away, but I couldn't find the map I was
looking for.  
There were maps. Really detailed ones for this area. But I couldn't find
a large map detailed enough for what I wanted.  
Maybe there's one at a larger police box or a nearby police station?
Thinking that, I looked at a map of the neighborhood and noticed
something.  
"A library……"  
  
Fortunately, the library was intact. Some of the glass was broken and
some of the books were ruined, but the maps were stored in the
warehouse. After spending a whole day searching, I found a map and
compared it to the direction the blonde child had run. There was
something there.  
With proper facilities, tens of thousands of people could live there for
ten years, and they should be able to create new things.  
That is…….  
"Petrochemical Complex"  
  
\*\*\*  
  
The petrochemical complex. A place where not only was oil stored, but
there were also thermal power plants, oil refineries, steel mills, and
companies that handle oil.  
On that day eleven years ago, the world changed and distribution
stopped. The government at the time did not use the oil stored in the
complex to maintain the lives of citizens, but switched to military use
and long-term storage.  
In cooperation with the US military, they built facilities to use the
area as a base and shelter, and the facility, which accepted some
evacuees, changed into something like a fortress after ten years.  
  
"So you abandoned valuable equipment and retreated, is that correct?"  
"……Yes"  
In that concrete-enclosed room, a blonde girl with dull hair,
illuminated by a small electric light, was being questioned by a
superior officer.  
The government collapsed within a few years, and the title of politician
elected by the people became meaningless. Pseudo-activists who were
fighting for peoples’ rights were eliminated, and real power was
dominated by large corporations with production facilities and
stockpiles, the US military, and the Self-Defense Forces with military
power.  
In that situation, Jennifer, the blonde girl who was the commander of
the 208th squad, a unit against "Giant Beasts," was enduring the
pressure from a man who looked like a soldier with a frightened
expression.  
"You also know how valuable that was. Is your 'education' still
insufficient?"  
"But, but――"  
Thud!  
A soldier-like man behind her struck Jennifer's shoulder with a club
when she tried to speak.  
"Talking back...do you really want to be 'educated'?"  
"……I'm……sorry"  
Jennifer bowed her head while holding her struck shoulder.  
  
Although there were supplies due to stockpiling and production, they
weren’t infinite. Special steel materials like spears were valuable, but
heavy weapons with good precision from before the world changed were
precious and irreplaceable.  
Even so, why weren't the adults around her showing sympathy for the
violence being inflicted on the girl around ten years old, who belonged
to the military, but instead showing fearful expressions?  
The Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit. The adults who noticed the
abnormality of the children born after the world changed greatly feared
the newly born "foreign objects."  
In times of peace, if there had been any mental leeway, they would have
probably accepted them, even if they held an aversion. But the humans
who had continued to have their families, friends, and loved ones killed
had no room to accept foreign objects and were about to decide to
eliminate them. However, among them, the military, which was worried
about the shortage of soldiers, came up with the idea of using the
physical abilities of the new children.  
  
Thorough ideological education from before they were old enough to
understand. Ceaseless physical training. While inflicting training close
to torture on young children that would make a person want to cover
their eyes, the adults feared the children without guilt.  
They will bare their fangs eventually. They will rebel eventually. These
people aren't human…….  
They're the same kind as the "Giant Beasts."  
The fear of the old humans who may eventually be driven out by the new
humans.  
In particular, Jennifer, who was raised by an American military couple
until she was four years old and was one of the few early members who
was spared from elimination, was ideologically unstable, which spurred
on the "education" she was given.  
  
―A drug was dropped to Jennifer, who was squatting down after being
struck several times.  
"If you are too rebellious, we will reduce the supply of ‘medicine.'"  
"―N-no"  
Terror appeared on Jennifer's face at those words, and she hurriedly
hugged the pills to her chest.  
"I expect you to work hard next time. You may leave."  
After saying that, the superior officer left the interrogation room with
the soldiers. The lights were immediately turned off, and in the cold
concrete room enveloped in darkness, Jennifer let out a small sob.  
"……Dad……mom……"
