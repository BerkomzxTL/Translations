# 81 The Radio Tower

"We don't know what's inside. Everyone, don't let your guard down!"  
***"Yes, sir!"***  
At the special forces captain's voice, we stormed into the abandoned
giant radio tower.  
The first floor was quite large, and it looked like there were many
shops and facilities even from the outside, but as expected, the
entrance was blocked by the encroachment of giant trees.  
If it were just me, I could fly in, but it's impossible to carry
everyone and their equipment. It's not that it's hard to carry them, but
because my wings use "heat" like a jet of air to fly, if I flew up all
at once, the humans probably wouldn't be able to withstand it.  
Since we don't know if there are giant creatures above, we decided to
climb diligently rather than take the risk.  
  
We set up a position in front of the entrance with vehicles, and
Jennifer and the others used steel spears to dig into the roots of the
entrance.  
Thanks to their high physical abilities, the engineers were dumbfounded
by the way the tree roots crumbled as if a fork were piercing a wafer.
I've never eaten a wafer though.  
Then, the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit rushed in one after another
through the hole they had opened. And there...  
"It looks like there were people who took refuge here..."  
"Yeah..."  
  
When the world first changed, the tourists at the time might have tried
to go home. But, giant creatures rampaged and many people couldn't
leave, so it seems that this place became a temporary shelter until
rescue came.  
There weren’t many creatures that became giantin the city. Still, there
was a zoo, and because it's a city, congestion delayed the Self-Defense
Forces from entering the city center, and because it was the city
center, humans lost places to escape.  
There were restaurants and stores on the first floor, and it seems that
the humans who took refuge there barricaded themselves, and many corpses
were left in the filthy, dusty corridors and on the sofas in the shops,
curled up as if asleep.  
  
"...The wounded and the second unit will remain here and bury the
bodies."  
The special forces captain ordered. More than ten years have passed, and
the corpses outside have weathered and disappeared, but there should be
many corpses left not only here but also in the surrounding buildings.  
We can't bury them all, and in the current world, skeletal remains are
not uncommon, but still, the captain may have thought that we should pay
our respects at least.  
"Tsubaki..."  
"Yes. Put your hands together and say *Rest in Peace *to them in your
heart."  
I taught the children who hadn’t received education how to do it. This
is enough for now, right?  
  
"I've found the emergency stairs!"  
"Then let's go!"  
We had to go up, but there's no electricity, so naturally we had to
climb on foot.  
However, it's narrow and impossible for everyone to climb, so the
wounded and volunteers were supposed to secure the base on the first
floor. However, if even one giant creature appears, they’ll be wiped
out, so a few members from the special forces and the children were left
behind.  
  
Even if you say ‘climb,’ it's not that easy. I'm pretty sure height is
around 600 meters. Even if the location of the target equipment is
around 400 to 500 meters, won't we be climbing more than 100 floors?  
Moreover, with equipment such as firearms and food.  
"............"  
The people who were climbing gradually spoke less and less, and their
footsteps became heavier with a sense of tension.  
The soldiers were carrying dozens of kilograms of equipment, but the
first to complain were the engineers who only had minimal tools.  
Well, that's only natural.  
  
"Mister, I'll carry that."  
"...I'm sorry, boy."  
The children who had energy were calling out to the engineers. They must
have had various thoughts in their hearts, but the engineers looked
really apologetic as they entrusted their luggage to the children.  
In the end, we decided to climb for one hour and rest for fifteen
minutes, and we couldn't reach the target upper floor that day, so we
spent the night in the emergency stairs surrounded by walls.  
***"Wafun!"***  
Even in such a situation, Hachibei and the children had energy to spare,
and they ran up and down the stairs to play, making sure not to disturb
the adults.  
So energetic...  
  
"I'm sorry..."  
"It's okay."  
We couldn't light a fire in the stairwell, so I distributed ready-made
soup from a pot that I warmed with "heat" from my palm to the captain,
who accepted it with a tired look on his face.  
All I brought was this pot and some food. Considering I can throw giant
creatures around, I could carry a little more luggage, but like the
children, it seems that the adults' pride won out over relying on me,
who falls into the category of a child in appearance.  
  
We slept awkwardly on the stairs... Well, the biggest problem was the
toilet, but we somehow managed everything and made it to the next
morning.  
After finishing breakfast and getting ready to depart... the young
soldiers, ignoring the captain, who had a very sullen look on his face,
came to me with a "request."  
"Am I going in front?"  
  
Well, I don't mind...  
The day before, Hachibei climbed in the lead in case a problem arose,
followed by the children, and then the adults.  
In that situation, I was climbing at the very back to catch anyone who
slipped and fell due to fatigue...  
"Pace maker?"  
In short, it seems that the adults couldn’t maintain their pace when
Hachibei, who runs freely in the lead, and the children who can keep up
with him are in front.  
  
After that, I let Hachibei and the children climb as they pleased, and I
climbed in between them to become the adults' pace maker.  
But...  
"Tsubaki... you know being looked at?"  
"............"  
Ah, yes. Even I can tell.  
  
As Jennifer, who deliberately came down and chose to climb with me,
pointed out, it seems that visually consuming "me," who was being called
"eye candy," had the effect of making them forget their fatigue.  
I don't know... I don't mind, but this must be why the captain had a
bitter expression on his face. The young people will probably be
subjected to harsh training later.  
I vaguely felt that it was that, so I subtly increased my pace, but they
kept up, so it seems like it had an effect.  
...Everyone collapsed on the floor as soon as we reached our destination
though.  
  
As expected, no giant creatures had climbed this far, so there were no
attacks as we had been wary of.  
Are there no giant bird-like creatures in Japan?  
After taking a break for about an hour, the engineers started to work.
From that point on, there was nothing for us to do. We just needed to
remove the necessary equipment and take it back... or so I thought, but
the engineers said that they would perform a communication test using
the equipment they had brought.  
"Can you do that?"  
"Apparently it's technically possible, but I don't know."  
When I asked the captain who was supervising the work, he crossed his
arms and made a difficult face.  
He said that there were engineers from industrial companies in that
shelter, so they might have been building something like that.  
There were many artificial satellites high up in the sky, and most of
them had reached the end of their life or had gone off course and become
unusable in the last ten years, but they were trying to see if they
could access them.  
Well, the US is the one who wants to communicate, so I guess that's how
it'll be?  
Some time passed as they worked, and while those who were free were
preparing food and lodging, thinking that we would be staying here again
today, suddenly a voice came from the engineers.  
"―We're connected!"  
  
The adults headed over to the voice, and as I watched with the children,
the mood began to shift a little.  
"...What's wrong?"  
Jennifer let out an anxious voice. When I asked a young soldier nearby
what was going on, he told me with a bewildered expression after
confirming the situation.  
"It seems that they didn't establish communication, but rather captured
information being broadcast in all directions."  
  
Audio data was being sent from somewhere, and the adults who heard it
turned pale.  
"A US military outpost was destroyed...?"  
It wasn't confirmed information, but it seems that a base for collecting
information on the continent had been destroyed, and now information was
only being broadcast from there.  
Considering that it’ll continue until the power runs out, it was
estimated to be relatively new information.  
The contents were...  
"...A dragon-like individual on the continent has taken flight towards
the east. The estimated region is..."  
  
In its path was East Asia... Japan.
