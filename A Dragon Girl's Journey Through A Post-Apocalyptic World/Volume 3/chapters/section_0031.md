# 87 New World

"......The Earth's......will?"  
Tamachii laughed heartily at my muttering.  
In the world over there......Mundus also left the damage unattended to
reduce the number of living things, and dumped excess magical energy
into this world.  
Does the world really have a "will"......? But it's not some kind of
god. If we consider the world......the "planet" as a single living
organism, then perhaps there is something that determines the direction
it takes.  
  
Surely the surface of the planet is like a garden to the "world."  
A beautiful garden that has been created little by little over a long
period of time. If plants sprout there, and small insects wander in, it
should cherish them even if they are weeds or insects it doesn't know.  
But, if trees are planted and beautiful flowers bloom, the weeds that
absorb nutrients become a nuisance.  
Cute little birds and beautiful insects can stay as they are, but if a
large number of insects that wither the leaves spring up, it’ll water
them to get rid of them.  
  
I suppose humans are like clover and mint to the world.  
They take root and multiply on their own without being cared for. If
that withers other plants and even beneficial insects stop coming near,
it becomes a problem.  
To manage it, which regenerates quickly with even a small root, it’s
necessary to peel off the entire ground of the garden and replace it
with new soil. But doing that is difficult, and other plants will also
be damaged.  
The events of legends like Noah's Ark may be the result of peeling off
and replacing the ground.  
But the "world," which disliked re-creating a garden that had grown this
far, tried a simpler method......to get some of the "overgrown
livestock" from the house next door.  
That was what happened on......this world, "Earth."  
  
"You're pretty much right, Hanatsubaki-chan,"  
Tamachii, who had read my thoughts, nodded with a smile.  
"But, Hanatsubaki-chan, you get me, right?"  
"............Yeah."  
Humans were reduced because they became a nuisance to the world. Even if
many humans died at the will of the world alone, I understood that it
was necessary.  
I'm not a "human." I’ve come to terms with being a "dragon". To me, all
living things are equal. But......  
  
"......Did Tamachii create me?"  
"I'm not your mama, silly. If anything, the 'dragon' is kinda like
honeybee that helps pollinate an orchard."  
......I don't really understand what that means  
"A 'manager' like a 'dragon' is born on its own regardless of will.
That's why even if they disappear, you can't just whip up another one at
any time."  
"Then, why do I look like a 'human'?"  
  
If there were dragons on Earth long ago, and ancient people saw them,
then the dragons in this world should look the same as Waleum. But why
do I look like a person?  
When I asked Tamachii that, she looked at me with "eyes" that seemed
human......but couldn't possibly be human, like gazing into the abyss.  
  
"Earth is a planet that was on the verge of destruction due to the
proliferation of humans. So, it was enough to just shrink the number of
humans. But y'know......humans are also 'kids' born on this planet."  
"Kids......"  
"Dragons" were the caretakers of the "world". But to the "world", humans
and other living things were the children born on this planet. Even if
they pollute and destroy this planet, humans born here have the right to
live in this world. That's why......  
"I wanted Hanatsubaki-chan to be able to see people as equals, to treat
them equally, and then make her choice."  
  
The "world" interfered with the appearing "dragon." Only I, who am not a
child of this world......only the "dragon," can distinguish all living
things without favoritism.  
To judge from a third-party perspective whether the human species is
really necessary on this planet.  
  
"So......we're fighting?"  
"That's what it ended up as, yep."  
As long as the magical energy from Mundus doesn't stop, humans will
perish even if the world doesn't change. Because of magical energy,
monsters are multiplying faster than new humans can be born and grow.  
  
***“――Do you understand? O ‘dragon’ of this world――”***  
  
After finishing the conversation with Tamachii, the dark dragon Waleum
spoke to me.  
"Your existence is the gateway to Mundus, isn't it?"  
***“――Indeed. As long as I exist in this world, the magical energy from
Mundus will not stop. ‘Fire Dragon’ of this world. Will you fight me, or
not?――”***  
"......I guess so."  
  
It’s been one year since I woke up. It was a short time, but I had
important encounters.  
Jinbei became my friend, someone who knew nothing and had never
interacted with anyone.  
Granny taught me the warmth and kindness of human beings.  
I fought many battles with giant animals. As a result, we became enemies
and killed each other, but I still don't hate or dislike them. That's
the same for Utan, who was partial to humans.  
I met many new people and children for the first time.  
There were some unpleasant people, but to me, they were weak and in need
of protection.  
That's why I―  
  
―Crack.  
My limbs were covered in scarlet scales starting from the tips, and
scarlet wings made of scales spread out as if pushing aside the scales
that covered my back. My vital points, as well as my neck and about half
of my face, were also covered in scales. I looked up at the black dragon
with my golden "dragon’s eyes."  
  
"I will protect them. The weak of this world. As the 'dragon' of this
world."  
  
At my words, Tamachii laughed gently, and Hachibei, who had been
trembling, wagged his tail.  
And......  
***“――Very well. Try to push aside my existence――”***  
Black mist rose from Waleum's entire body, and Tamachii wrapped Hachibei
in a mysterious power and moved back.  
  
Clang!!  
I shot out with my antler spear, spewing flames from my entire body. As
my antler spear and Waleum's claws collided, there was a huge flash of
light.  
Waleum spread his black wings and ascended into the sky in an instant,
firing a "night" colored breath at me directly below.  
"――――――――――……Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
In response, I spewed flames from my wings and danced in the air,
pouring my “feelings” into the “heat” of my entire body and firing it as
"dragon's breath."  
The night sky and the sun-like flames collided, dyeing half the plant
crimson.  
"***'――――!!'***"  
  
That day―a roar that resounded throughout the world shook the sky, and a
gigantic flame appeared as if Mount Fuji's crater had erupted.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
A deep, lush forest. The tall mountain that burst like a flower in the
distance was once called *Fuji*.  
"It's coming after us!"  
"Leave it to me!"  
A chestnut-haired girl who jumped out of the deep forest shouted to her
companions, and a black-haired young man in his twenties, who had been
waiting for her, stepped forward with his weapon.  
  
The young man of the "Round-Ear Tribe," a race nearly two meters tall,
was clad in armor made of huge scales and casually held a metal
greatsword as tall as he was.  
The young man jumped out to replace the young girl from a race known as
the "Long-Ear Tribe," who had jumped out of the forest, collided with
the huge shadow that had jumped out in pursuit of her.  
***“BmoooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!”***  
  
"Giant boar......a big one!"  
Dogoooooon!!  
Although he collided with a huge boar as big as a hut, the young man
managed to hold his ground, being only slightly pushed back while
colliding with it.  
"Now!"  
At that voice, the "Long-Ear Tribe" girl who had returned gouged out one
of the giant boar's eyes with the bow she had readied, and in that gap,
the "Beast Tribe" young man with the spear jumped out and stabbed the
giant boar's head from directly above.  
***“BmoooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!”***  
Even so, the giant boar was still alive. Seeing that, the "Round-Ear
Tribe" girl who was at the very back readied a metal cylinder.  
"Get away!!"  
At her voice, the three companions jumped away, and the cylinder held by
the "Round-Ear" girl spat fire.  
Doooooooon!!  
With a roar, a bullet fired from the cylinder pierced the giant boar's
remaining eye, and with its brain destroyed, it collapsed with a roar
that shook the earth.  
  
"We did it!"  
"We defeated it!"  
The companions gathered and jumped up and down, joining hands and
rejoicing.  
"But, we used a bullet......even though they're expensive."  
When the "Round-Ear Tribe" girl lamented, the "Round-Ear Tribe" young
man put his hand on her head.  
"It was pretty big. It couldn’t be helped."  
The "Long-Ear Tribe" girl and the "Beast Tribe" young man nodded at the
young man's words.  
"Then let's go to the 'Ruins.' I want a disc!"  
"That's right.......I don't think monsters will come out if we don't go
too far in."  
"There might be giant beasts, but we can do it!"  
  
They were childhood friends who had grown up in a nearby village, and a
few years ago, they had gone to the city and were making a living as
"Explorers."  
Explorers were those who make a living by discovering, excavating, and
bringing back ancient artifacts from the ruins of the old human race
that collapsed four hundred years ago.  
The things obtained from the ancient civilization that lasted for
thousands of years were not just jewels and precious metals.  
High-quality steel that couldn’t be made by today's humans, rust-free
work tools. Medicines that were still usable, stored in special boxes
and rooms. Black discs that play music using special needles were traded
at high prices.  
And, the easiest thing to find, and the most difficult thing to find in
perfect condition......there were various types of books, and academic
books such as for medicine were highly valued.  
  
Today's humans evolved by taking in the "magical energy" that filled the
atmosphere and producing "mana" in their bodies. Multiple races suited
to the environment were born.  
Similarly, the materials taken from creatures called "monsters" that had
adapted to magical energy containining mysterious powers could be used
to make various things. Not only weapons and equipment, but also
powerful things like the bullets for the gun used by the "Round-Ear
Tribe" girl.  
More than four hundred years since the old civilization was
destroyed......Humans survived as a new species adapted to the current
world, and in order to counter powerful giant beasts and monsters, they
created countries and were establishing a culture close to the Middle
Ages of the old civilization.  
  
And, the four of them, who decided on a new exploration area in the
cluster of ruins referred to as *Tokyo*, encountered an upright cow-like
monster at the ancient ruins called *Shinjuku Station*.  
"This guy's gonna use a weapon!"  
"Using a gun?!"  
"In a narrow place like this―Guh!"  
One of the "towers" adjacent to Shinjuku Station. There, the "Round-Ear
Tribe" young man was blown away along with the greatsword he was using
as a shield by an axe strike unleashed by the "Cow Beastman."  
The "Beast Tribe" young man quickly stepped in with a spear to protect
his companion, causing the cow beastman monster to sneer.  
Monsters were highly intelligent and their physical abilities surpassed
those of giant beasts. The cow beastman monster was about three meters
tall and not as threatening as a giant monster, but it was a difficult
enemy that appeared even in ruins like this.  
  
"At this rate......"  
"I'll hold him off! Run away quickly!"  
"No way..."  
The four had fought monsters before, but they had only fought alongside
stronger explorers. They thought that powerful monsters would not appear
inside the ruins, but the four of them were made aware that their
thinking was naive. At that time―  
  
***“Wau!”***  
A beast-like cry was heard from the depths of the ruins. Immediately
after, a brown object, galloping on all fours just below the ceiling,
which was over three meters high, feinted by jumping to the left and
right, and blew away the cow beastman with a body blow.  
***“Bmooooo!?”***  
***“Wau!”***  
The giant brown beast......that is  
"Shiba!?"  
  
Among the giant beasts, there were giant creatures that had become
accustomed to humans and lived alongside them.  
There were giant cows that let humans help raise their young in exchange
for milk, and giant sheep that coexisted by letting humans shear their
excess wool. Giant wolves called "Shiba" easily got along with children
and were highly valued as travel companions due to their cuteness.  
What is the reason for such a beast to be here―  
  
"―Isn't it too early for you to be here yet?"  
Thud!  
***“Bomoooooo!?”***  
The cow beastman, whose chest was suddenly pierced from behind by
something sharp, was shocked. Even so, the cow beastman, who was about
to point his axe to the rear, had his heart burned by the spear that
spewed flames in his chest at that moment, and collapsed without even
letting out a death cry.  
The cow beastman monster slowly fell forward, and the one who appeared
there was―  
"Don't you know that there are still dangerous monsters around here?"  
  
What appeared was a girl clad in bright red leather armor.  
She was probably about halfway through her teens. The girl with pale
copper skin and pinkish silver hair had features so well-defined that
they couldn't help but be captivated. But more than that, the horns
growing from her head and the long, extending reptilian tail caught
their eyes.  
"T-Thank you for saving us......"  
"Yeah."  
A skin color they had never seen before. A race with characteristics
they had never seen before. While confused, the girl, to whom they were
giving their thanks, narrowed her golden eyes and smiled.  
"Like I said before, there are still monsters around here, and there are
also dangerous carnivorous giant beasts, so it's best to gain experience
near the entrance. Let's go, Jubei¹."   
***“Wau!”***  
When the girl called out, the Shiba giant beast wagged its tail and
followed behind.  
While dumbfounded at the sight of her leaving as suddenly as she
appeared, as well as her easily defeating the monster that the four of
them could not, the Round-Ear Tribe girl regained her senses and called
out to her back.  
  
"Thank you! Please tell me your name!"  
Hearing that, the girl who was about to leave turned back slightly and
smiled.  
  
"I'm Hanatsubaki......the 'Dragon' of this world."

*This marks the final chapter. Thank you for reading.*  
*This post-apocalyptic world and travel story started as an experiment,
but if I had had a little more time to write it carefully, there might
have been a slightly different ending.*  
*Personally, I wanted to write more stories like Utan's, but it's
difficult.*  
*This work felt more suited for a manga than a book.*  

*I have various strange story ideas in stock, so I'm thinking of
presenting some on an experimental basis.*  
*Thank you always for your comments and typo reports.*  
*See you next time!*

I ended up being very wishy-washy with the sfx, so they were translated
on vibe.  
Thanks for reading :)

*I picked up [Does the Assassin Girl Dream of the Mana
Doll?](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/does-the-assassin-girl-dream-of-the-mana-doll/)
somewhat recently. Check it out if it seems interesting; I think it's
very good so far.  
I want to note that I picked up where femme fables left off at chapter
25, even though the NU releases start at 45. The links for those can all
be found
