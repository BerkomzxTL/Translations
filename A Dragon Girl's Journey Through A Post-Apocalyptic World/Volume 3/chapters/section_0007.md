# 63 Ominous Presence

***"Wafun!"***  
A few weeks have passed since Hachibei's chubbiness problem was
discovered. Hachibei, who has completely returned to his original
weight, was running alongside the kei truck, jumping as if skipping.  
Although I say his weight has returned, he hasn’t actually lost any.
What I mean is, I fed him a lot of eel and had him exercise, and he grew
rapidly, and he looks less like a puppy now.  
But he's not a wolf, he's just a big Shiba Inu...  
In the end, his weight hasn't decreased, and it looks like Hachibei will
gain even more weight from now on, so he can't ride in the bed of the
kei truck anymore. But Hachibei seems to enjoy running now that he has
grown and can move his body, so he doesn't seem to have any regrets
about the truck bed.  
  
Well, if I think about it, Hachibei is a giant animal, so he wouldn't
get summer heat exhaustion. It was my fault for thinking that he would
grow faster because he's a puppy and eats a lot.  
"Weight, huh..."  
I'm driving the kei truck all the time, so I wonder if I'm okay? But in
the first place, using "heat" consumes extra calories, and I don't think
I'm eating enough in the first place. Rather than not enough, I feel
like I can't eat much yet? When I use too much "heat" and I'm starving,
I can eat about half of a giant deer, but it doesn't feel like enough.  
But I'm gradually increasing the amount I can eat at once, so after
enough time, I might be able to grow too.  
  
But my body isn't growing at all...  
I looked it up using the equipment at the abandoned school, but my
height hasn't increased and my weight hasn't changed since I checked at
Granny's house.  
I thought that I had simply stopped growing, but when I saw myself in
the mirror in the abandoned school, I looked the same as I did in the
abandoned hospital where I was born. No, the "Dragon" parts of my horns
and tail are growing, but the human-like parts are still the same,
around my early to mid teens.  
Maybe I'll stay like this forever...?  
No, no, it's only been a year and a half, so maybe I'm just growing
slowly.  
"Let's grow slowly together, okay?"  
***"Wafun?"***  
Hachibei's growth rate should mean he'll live several times longer than
a normal dog. In a few years, Hachibei will be an adult, and in a few
decades, I'll be an adult too... right?  
  
The journey itself has been going smoothly. Hachibei liked the sea and
it was easy to secure food, so we traveled along the national route
close to the sea and finally entered the Kanto region.  
That was a long journey... I think it would have been faster to run, but
in the end, it depends on the detours I take.  
But... I haven't met a single human so far.  
If the sea is nearby, people can catch fish by diving or fishing even if
they can't go out far to fish. It should be relatively easy to get food,
but there've been no such people.  
But I think there are two main possibilities for this.  
One is that humans have been almost completely wiped out by the giant
creatures that went south in pursuit of evacuees.  
I don't want to think about it, but the possibility is high.  
And the other... there was a reason for everyone to evacuate, even if
they had to force themselves to do so.  
  
If it were more north, I think there would be people who would stay like
Granny and the people around her, rather than risking being attacked by
giant creatures. In fact, I saw many large buses and cars that had been
attacked along the way.  
But the closer I got to the Kanto region, the fewer traces of people
there were, which means they decided that it was safer to evacuate even
if they had to push themselves.  
There’s probably a large evacuation center somewhere in this Kanto
region.  
  
The journey has been going smoothly... but as we entered the Kanto
region and moved away from the coast, the atmosphere became a little
different from before.  
"Traces of battle... huh?"  
I couldn't help but stop the car at the sight.  
Military and police-like vehicles, which I had occasionally seen in the
larger cities so far, were destroyed and abandoned. Nearby, a large
number of giant animal bones were visible, buried in the grass.  
This area must have been the defense line from the north. But... giant
creatures aren’t armies.  
They came from the mountains, the forests, the watersides, bypassing
roads made by humans, and attacking with their own individual will to
exterminate the enemy "humans".  
For humans, giant creatures are hostile. But there are some, like those
wolves, that could be understood.  
But maybe I can only think that way because I'm not human...?  
  
***"Kyuu~n?"***  
Hachibei licked my cheek worriedly as I got out of the kei truck and
looked at the remains of the battle.  
"No, it's nothing."  
I ruffled Hachibei's fur as I thought about what to do from now on.  
Hachibei has never seen a human. What kind of reaction will he show when
he meets one? And what actions will humans take towards Hachibei and the
wolves?  
At that time, what will I...?  
  
"...Well, I won't know until that time comes."  
***"Wafu?"***  
"Let's go further today, okay?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
When he heard that we were going a little further, Hachibei happily
wagged his tail in response.  
...This dog is just a kid who loves going for walks, isn't he?  
"Let's go."  
But I have to decide.  
What’s important to me?  
  
From then on, the journey became even slower than before. The traces of
battle continued, and there were many destroyed vehicles, some of which
had to be moved.  
"Teryaa!"  
***"Wafu."***  
The half-hearted shout was just for fun. It had become a routine task to
lift up and throw away cars.  
Hachibei could move the compact cars by himself, but I have to move the
military vehicles. If I were walking, I wouldn't have to do these
things.  
"Hmmm."  
The gas tank is about half full, and I haven't been able to maintain it
for a while, so it might be tough to continue riding in the kei truck.  
But, you know. It'd be a shame since I went to all that trouble of
fixing it.  
Let's go to the next town for now. If I can't get maintenance or
supplies there, I'll give up.  
...I'd switch to a cooler car if I had one.  
  
That's how we progressed, but the slow progress wasn’t just because of
the obstacles.  
Somehow... the air felt heavy.  
That's why Hachibei, who had been running alongside the kei truck, was
more quiet, and when we went to bed, he was snuggling up close to me.
What is it? Even if I answer myself, it’s troubling, but it feels like
that "premonition" I felt when hostile giant animals were approaching?  
However, that premonition manifested before us in a bad way.  
  
"This is..."  
***"Wafuu..."***  
Hachibei took a step back, looking disgusted when he saw it.  
Along the long national route, there was a townscape. In the middle of
the road, which was lined with shops and houses like a suburban town,
there was the corpse of a giant animal.  
"...A lion?"  
The giant animal was a female lion, eight meters in length. It was her
corpse. But she didn't die recently. The "mysterious power" that giant
animals have had completely disappeared, and she was starting to rot.  
It takes a month or two for giant animals, which even microorganisms
don't approach, to rot... but when she died isn't the big problem, it's
"who" killed the giant animal...  
"I'll check it out."  
***"Wafun!?"***  
"No, I'm not going to eat it!?"  
How desperate do you think I am!?  
  
The corpse of the giant lioness had been slashed with something sharp.  
There was not just one such wound. It wasn't an animal's claws or fangs.
There were countless wounds all over her body; all of which looked like
they had been made by a blade.  
"...Let’s proceed carefully. Please be careful, okay?"  
***"...Wau!"***  
Hachibei looked puzzled at my words, but when I stared straight at him,
he made a serious face and replied.  
Let's be careful... the one who defeated the giant lioness might not be
alone.  
  
Several days later, we arrived at a town that was similar to before, but
still quite large.  
There wasn't much, but as we continued straight ahead, we finally saw a
large building. There, small shadows were fighting a giant animal that
looked like a lion.  
That’s...  
"Humans...?"
