# 61 Kei Truck

Having fled the strange giant animal, Hachibei and I continued south
towards our destination.  
The national highway was half-buried and covered in weeds, but it was
still easy to walk on because it was flat. There was a narrow river
running along the highway, and there was also smoked fish, so we didn't
have any trouble finding food.  
"It's mostly straight, isn't it?"  
***"Wafun."***  
There were small towns dotted along the highway, and we were able to
obtain necessary supplies from undamaged houses and factories. But it's
still the countryside, so there weren't many buildings, and there was
nothing notable other than the straight national highway.  
"...How did people live around here?"  
  
A straight road. Few houses. What about schools for children?  
"You can't live without a car, can you?"  
***"Wafun?"***  
Hachibei looked at me with a questioning face as I started thinking
while walking.  
"I'm going to look for something."  
***"Waf!"***  
...He replied cheerfully, but does he understand?  
There were many of the things I was looking for scattered along the way,
but they were all wrecked in accidents or destroyed by giant animals.
Many had also been encroached upon by plants over the past ten years or
more, so there was nothing decent.  
That's why I was searching even in places I hadn't visited much before,
such as the large houses of wealthy farmers and the large factories I
saw.  
And as I was doing that...  
"Ooooh."  
I finally found something that looked promising, and my face broke into
a smile.  
"A decent car!"  
  
What I was looking for was a car. I had only ever seen broken ones
before, but I finally found a proper kei truck in the maintenance yard
of a car shop along the highway.  
Since the road is so straight and wide, I want to try using a car at
least once!  
The car shop wasn't a car dealer, but rather a repair shop that was
affiliated with one. Most of the cars in the parking lot were ruined,
but inside the shuttered maintenance yard, I found a decent kei truck
covered in dust.  
  
"Was it being serviced? Or was the servicing finished?"  
***"Wafuu?"***  
You don't know, do you?I don't know either.  
There were hardly any cars in the parking lot outside. Was it because
people evacuated in the cars that were there? If so, was this abandoned
kei truck still being repaired?  
But, in such a suburban area, everyone who worked here and the customers
would all come by car, and if they were going to escape, they would take
it with them, right? Even if the servicing was finished, they wouldn't
go out of their way to use a customer's car.  
"...Let's check it out."  
  
First, I found the key to the kei truck right away. It was simply stuck
in the driver's seat. So I twisted the key.  
―Crrrrr...burun.  
"Oh."  
―Bthun.  
"Ah..."  
***"Wau! Wau!"***  
It moved for a moment but then stopped immediately, and Hachibei barked
at the suddenly growling kei truck.  
"Okay, no you can’t~"  
I grabbed Hachibei, who was about to jump on the kei truck, and took him
outside through the pried-open shutter.  
"This isn't scary. Understand?"  
***"Wafu..."***  
If he were a normal dog, I'd just tell him to be careful, but even as a
puppy, Hachibei is already as strong as a bear, so the car would
probably break if he bumped into it. I've been feeding him a lot lately,
so his face is gradually becoming more dog-like.  
It can't be helped since it's the first time he's seen a "living" car,
but I need him to understand first or we won't be able to move
forward.  
  
Before investigating the cause of why it won't move, I'll wash it.
Fortunately, the stream was nearby, so I grabbed a few buckets from the
maintenance yard, drew water, and roughly cleaned the dust and dirt off
the outside with a deck brush.  
***"Wafu?"***  
As I scrubbed with the brush, Hachibei seemed to realize that the kei
truck wasn't something to be afraid of, and sniffed it and frowned. I
guess he's not used to the smell of oil and stuff?  
"Hoo..."  
There was quite a bit of stubborn dirt, but after washing it for two
hours, it became quite clean. It's not perfect yet, but it's good enough
for now.  
  
I searched the maintenance yard and office, and collected books and
manuals related to repairs and cars. I don't have the basic knowledge to
investigate the condition of the kei truck. I still read all the books
even though I only found manuals for people who already understood the
technical terms.  
***"Wafu..."***  
Hachibei, who had finished his meal of smoked fish and frogs from the
stream, yawned sleepily. I leaned my back against Hachibei's fur as he
lay down, and continued reading even after it got dark using the
moonlight and my "Dragon's Eyes."  
I still couldn't understand the meanings. But as I read, the contents
gradually began to stick in my head, and "knowledge" began to supplement
it, filling in the gaps.  
  
The strange knowledge I've had since I was born.  
I don't know why I know it, and I don't know how I learned it. The bias
in my knowledge can be troublesome sometimes, but that bias was related
to what I "learned."  
When I smoked food at the abandoned hospital where I was born and at
Jinbei's house, I was only given a few pages of short articles in
magazines, but I was able to adjust the heating and salting well. From
the second time on, I was able to fillet fish and butcher animals
without hesitation.  
Perhaps my "knowledge" filled in the gaps in what I only
half-remembered, and supplemented it as if remembering what I had
forgotten.  
Well, in the end, I don't know why it comes to me, but as I repeatedly
read the materials until morning, I had accumulated enough maintenance
knowledge to be considered an amateur car enthusiast.  
"Shall we give it a try?"  
***"Wafun."***  
Eh? A walk first?  
  
Anyway, when I looked inside, it seemed that the servicing had been
completed, and the inside was clean, even if the outside wasn't. If
that's the case, is the reason why it won't start the battery? It looks
brand new (11 years old), but maybe it’s dead? Also, the oil might be
old.  
I rummaged through the maintenance yard and warehouse, and quickly found
new oil, so I'll drain the old oil first.  
"Hup."  
I lifted the kei truck with one hand and placed a base under the tire to
lift it a little.  
I think... with this newly emerging "knowledge," I located the oil
filler hole under the seat, placed a container under the car body, and
drained the oil.  
"Muddyy~"  
***"Wafuu\~~"***  
I feel like the viscosity is a little high. I'll leave it for a few
hours for now.  
  
The problem is the battery. When I measured it with the machine I found,
it seemed that it was almost empty because it had naturally discharged.
However, it doesn't seem to be damaged or deteriorated in appearance, so
it should work if I charge it. But to do that, I need something to
charge it.  
If I can bring another car and charge it, it would be better to use that
battery. But should I collect batteries just in case?  
Even if I wanted to use a charger, the electricity’s been cut off in the
first place. But I thought there might be one, so I went around to a few
neighboring farmers with Hachibei for a walk, and found an old generator
after a few of them.  
"...Will this work?"  
***"Wafun."***  
Fixing a generator to fix a kei truck is a bit too roundabout. And when
I tried to see if it would work, another problem arose.  
"I need gasoline, don't I?"  
  
Either way, I need it to move the kei truck, but I’ve been putting it
off thinking I could do it last, and now it's the first thing I
need...  
I grabbed the container and soy sauce slosh that were in the maintenance
yard and went round the farmers again. Well, it's okay because we can
also harvest vegetables.  
"This one's no good either."  
***"Wafu."***  
There was no need to check; Hachibei told me it was no good just by
sniffing it.  
Most of the cars abandoned on the national highway were either broken
or, even if they looked decent at first glance, had been exposed to the
elements for more than ten years and the tanks were corroded.  
I have no choice but to get it from a car that's stored in a building,
just like that kei truck. In the first place, gasoline also
deteriorates, so I think cars left outdoors are no good.  
Still, thank you farmers. There was still gasoline left in the tractors
stored in the garages, and after going around to a few houses, I
collected a decent amount.  
  
―......Brrr.  
"I did it."  
Once the generator was running, I connected the charger to it and then
to the battery.  
Meanwhile, I replaced the oil that had finally stopped dripping with new
oil. ...Should I wash the inside first? How? ...Never mind, I guess it's
fine as it is.  
After thinking about it, I gave up and finished changing the oil. It’ll
still take some time to charge, so I checked the tire pressure in the
meantime. The tires were still new and there was a generator, so there
were no problems there either.  
And...  
  
Crrrr...Crrrr...Bthun.  
"No good..."  
***"Kyuun"***  
Hachibei licked me to comfort me as I was feeling down. No, it's cute,
but he smells fishy.  
There's still something wrong, or the gasoline is too old, but the kei
truck's engine won't start. Still, I couldn't give up, so I tried
replacing the plugs with new ones, but it didn't work. But, as I was
turning the key, I suddenly saw what looked like a human figure beyond
the windshield.  
"...Eh."  
......Brrrrrrr.  
"Ah, I did it!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
Hachibei and I rejoiced together as the engine finally started. But
then... I remembered and looked out the windshield, but the figure of
that "girl in a uniform" was nowhere to be seen.  
...Another ghost, I guess.  
  
"Alright, let's go!"  
***"Waf!"***  
I loaded our luggage and Hachibei into the truck bed, and set off in the
kei truck. The road was full of weeds and we couldn't go fast, and it
was faster for us to run, but still, I set off south in the exhilaration
of having done something new.
