# 69 Assault

***"Guru..."***  
As the alpha male of the group growled lowly, the nearby giant lionesses
moved away fearfully.  
He was irritated. There was an "individual" repeatedly encroaching on
his territory, and defeating his subordinates.  
The giant male lion, leader of the pride, held dominion over the vast
ruined city once called "Tokyo." The leader of the pride had absorbed
the groups of giant lions from several zoos in the Kanto region,
expanding his power.  
Though offspring were few, they were born, and the heightened
intelligence meant he did not eliminate all other males, but rather,
those of his offspring with high intelligence... individuals who knew
their place, he placed in various parts of this vast Tokyo, granting
them territories. But several individuals from those prides were being
defeated.  
  
Once, a species called "two-legs" had dominated this world.  
In a struggle that lasted several years, many giant creatures were
defeated by "two-legs" wielding fire-spewing weapons, but even more
"two-legs" fell, greatly reducing their numbers. Overpopulation led to
food shortages, and they couldn't survive the lowered temperatures of
winter, leading to widespread self-destruction.  
For giant animals, they were now only valuable as food.  
But, several years after the "two-leg" population was nearly
annihilated... "two-leg" juveniles with abnormal physical abilities
appeared, and began killing their own kind.  
However, the group leader was not only irritated by that.  
Certainly, the juveniles possessed the physical ability to fight giant
creatures. But, in the last few years, they had been using weak
individuals as bait to investigate the "two-leg" base in the east. If
they gathered their numbers and fought in that inescapable place, they
could annihilate them.  
So, what was the cause of the giant male lion's, the group leader's
irritation?  
It was―  
  
***"Gaaah!"***  
Sensing that "it" had finally appeared, he stood up, and a huge
thunderclap resounded from afar.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
"From now on, I am giving you all a special mission!"  
In a dimly lit warehouse-like place, a middle-aged officer, seemingly
Japanese, shouted.  
Even with the electricity from the few functioning thermal power plants,
they were getting sufficient power, but the warehouse lacked proper
lighting because materials like light bulbs and fluorescent tubes were
precious, but also because he didn't recognize that much humanity in the
dozen or so troops there.  
  
***"Yes sir!"***  
The dozen or so children replied in unison to the officer's words.  
Eighteen children aged eight to ten who had completed basic training,
ready to be deployed to the front lines of the anti-giant beast unit.
Among them, Jennifer, the oldest, felt crushed by the responsibility of
protecting the younger children, standing at the very front with a pale
face  
  
"I will now explain the operation details!"  
The operation's objective was to obtain equipment usable for
long-distance communication from the radio tower in Tokyo.  
Armed with something to negotiate with the United States, the military
and corporate executives decided to move forward with a previously
planned operation.  
Jennifer and regular soldiers had previously gone into the city to
search for electronic components and mass-produced industrial goods, but
this time the importance was different. For that reason, fifty regular
soldiers, including conscripts from the refugees, would accompany
Jennifer and the others on this operation.  
"In that event, your role is to neutralize any giant beasts you
discover. At worst, draw the giant beasts away from the objective. Don't
forget that's what your lives are for!"  
***"...yes sir."***  
  
The Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit and the regular soldiers were bait
and shields. While Jennifer and the others held back the giant beasts, a
special forces unit would escort ten technicians into the radio tower,
secure the materials, and then retreat. Jennifer and the others were
forbidden from retreating until that withdrawal was complete.  
  
"..."  
Jennifer unconsciously bit her lip at the severity of the operation's
details.  
Even with fifty regular soldiers, they would probably be useless. They
no longer had tanks with firepower and armor like before the mutation,
and while they had armored vehicles and machine guns, ammunition was
limited.  
Infantry armed with assault rifles that had been repeatedly repaired
with mismatched parts, using decade-old ammunition that might misfire at
any moment, were no match for giant beasts.  
Inevitably, Jennifer and The Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit would have
to stand at the front lines, and if they retreated and the regular
soldiers suffered casualties, it would become a problem. Some of the
volunteer soldiers were sympathetic to them, these "children," but if
the people who had been conscripted and feared Jennifer and the others
suffered casualties, their families would criticize them.  
No matter how much power they had, they were still children. If they
were criticized by the people they were protecting, without any sense of
camaraderie, more and more children would close their hearts.  
And... children who closed their hearts were the ones who died first.  
"Now then, the operation will commence tomorrow morning at 0600――"  
  
―DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!  
  
Suddenly, a thunderclap like lightning striking nearby reverberated, and
several people let out small screams.  
"What..."  
The officer, his words interrupted, frowned and tried to continue, but
the sound of a commotion reached them from afar, and the officer,
irritated, questioned the subordinates he had brought with him.  
"What's happening? Confirm it!"  
"Yes, sir!"  
The questioned subordinate contacted someone on his mobile radio, but
something seemed to be happening on the other end as well, and after a
confusing exchange, his face turned pale.  
"What is it! Report clearly!"  
"Y-yes, sir! Giant beasts..."  
The subordinate, beginning his report with a blue face, swallowed to
collect his thoughts, paused for a beat, and then began to speak.  
"Giant beasts... a horde of giant beasts is attacking from the west of
the base!!"  
  
\*\*\*  
  
***"Gaaaaaaah!!!"***  
  
It was more than just a horde of giant animals.  
"Kyaaaaah!"  
"The wall's going to break!"  
"What are the Self-Defense Forces doing!?"  
"Get the children to the center!"  
The base, built at the petrochemical complex, had few existing
buildings, so homes like prefabricated houses were built in the gaps
between storage tanks, forming a city.  
To prevent giant beasts from entering the walls and attacking the
storage tanks, no internal defenses had been deliberately constructed.  
The outer walls were made of steel frames and concrete gathered from the
surrounding area, and had defended against giant beast attacks several
times in the past decade, but the refugees were bewildered by the
"number of the horde" attacking this time.  
  
It wasn't just the giant lions that claimed the ruins of Tokyo as their
territory.  
Not only carnivorous animals such as Asian black bears and hyenas, but
also horses and boars that could be their prey, as well as alligators
and hippos that should have been in the water.  
As if it were the immediate aftermath of the world's cataclysm, all the
giant creatures seemed to be cooperating with hostility towards humans,
reminding people of past terrors.  
  
"Protect the gate!"  
The soldiers guarding the gate showered bullets from atop the outer
wall, but they couldn't penetrate the hides of large giant creatures,
let alone medium-sized ones.  
"Aim for the eyes!"  
Even knowing it was difficult to aim with high-recoil firearms, they
couldn't help but shout. Still, one would think that if the eyes, a
vital point for living creatures, were targeted, they would falter, but
the giant creatures repeated their attacks on the wall without
hesitation.  
  
Thud!!  
Boars and hippos, each over ten meters long, crashed into the wall. Even
though it was made of concrete, it was impossible to construct a
uniformly strong wall with limited resources, and cracks ran through it
with that single blow.  
***"Booo!"***  
In the instant that the gunfire stopped due to the vibrations, a giant
deer ran up the wall, which was over ten meters high, and impaled a
soldier with its antlers. Following after, carnivorous animals such as
lions and leopards used the backs of the hippos and boars as footholds
to climb over the wall and break in.  
***"Gaaaaaaah!"***  
Carnivorous beasts attacked and trampled the people who had not yet been
able to evacuate.  
  
"Fire!"  
It was the special forces, leading the regular soldiers, who arrived on
the scene.  
The machine gun installed on the armored car unleashed a deafening roar
and attacked a rampaging giant leopard, blowing it away in a spray of
blood.  
Two machine guns targeted giant animals, firing rockets to finish them
off.  
"All of you, it's showtime for the first time in a while!"  
At the captain's words, the special forces members mercilessly hammered
in explosives, and the special forces captain had a slight smile on his
face as he watched.  
Due to limited resources, the special forces were not given many
opportunities to operate, and they were dissatisfied with that. Unlike
immediately after the cataclysm, a certain amount of information about
giant beasts had been gathered. He wanted to show that there was no
problem if they were there, without relying on children like those, and
that they should streamline the unit's operations more.  
They were fully capable of fighting giant beasts. But that sense of
elation was shattered in the next moment.  
  
Dwoooooon!!  
The wall finally gave way and collapsed, and a massive number of giant
creatures poured into the wall like a dam breaking.  
Concrete cannot be made without sand. When making it with insufficient
materials, the humans at the time must have used sea sand, and the
brittle concrete could not withstand the attacks of large giant
beasts.  
A giant alligator, not caring for the machine guns, crushed an armored
vehicle and devoured the special forces members.  
  
"Why..."  
Jennifer and the others also went to the scene, stunned by the sight of
the wall, which had existed since they were old enough to understand
things, being breached.  
"I'll stop them!"  
Even so, she mustered her strength and gave instructions to her
comrades. Despair in her heart.  
How did this happen? What caused the giant beasts to suddenly rampage?  
The giant beasts' actions seemed as if they were being chased by
"something," as if they were frightened.  
(Please... someone...)  
  
\*\*\*  
  
In the dark hospital room where the doctors had left their posts and no
one was left, Hanatsubaki was restrained and lying down alone.  
"...Hey hey."  
Inside the room, filled with a gaseous sedative to neutralize
Hanatsubaki, a black-haired girl wearing a black sailor uniform was
looking down at the unconscious girl.  
"The 'humans' are asking for help, y'know~? You good with that~?"  
The girl spoke while flicking Hanatsubaki's forehead with her finger.  
"Gotta say, I'm lookin' forward to your choice."  
  
At that moment, the girl's figure disappeared from the hospital room.  
And then...  
―Crack.  
The metal fittings restraining Hanatsubaki groaned, and Hanatsubaki's
entire body began to be covered in bright red scales.
