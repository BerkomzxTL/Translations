# 80 What Remains

Dogooooooooooooon!!!!  
  
The hydrogen and oxygen from the decomposed water ignited, causing a
huge explosion and multiple thunder-like roars.  
The shockwave blew away the river water and surrounding windows,
collapsing several buildings and bridges.  
The explosive flames rose high into the sky, using the decomposed and
expanded atmosphere as a fuse, creating a mushroom cloud that scattered
the overcast sky.  
  
"............"  
Jushaaaaaa..........  
The remaining moisture at the bottom of the riverbed turned into steam
due to the extreme heat. As the riverbed instantly dried and cracked, I
remained covered in scorching red scales, knelt, and pointed the tip of
the equally scorching antler spear towards "that."  
  
***"............"***  
There, just like me, the Raijū stood, its gaze fixed sharply on me.  
But... The fur that had shone like the night sky was burned along with
the skin beneath, one eye was horribly crushed, and the remaining
glaring eye was gradually beginning to cloud over.  
The Raijū was dying...  
But... even so, it had not lost its will to fight.  
  
―Thud.  
The dying Raijū's huge body stepped forward. Its claws were chipped, one
of its giant canine teeth was broken, and charred skin peeled off with
each step.  
I grimaced at the shock damage remaining throughout my body, but still
stood up and readied the antler spear with trembling hands...  
―Crack!  
The moment the Raijū's horn and the antler spear touched, both
shattered, and the Raijū collapsed beside me.  
Thud...  
The broken antler spear slipped from my hand, and the Raijū with its
broken horn and I stared at each other in silence.  
A faint static electricity-like spark rose between us. I momentarily
closed my eyes at the grinning Raijū, and then―plunged my claws into the
Raijū's heart.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Gaan! Gaan!  
***"Wau!"***  
"Ah, hey! Don’t come any closer!"  
When I scolded Hachibei, who had been peeking at my work, Hachibei
jumped back from the "heat" and pressed his nose with his front paws.  
"Ahh, I told you so."  
***"Kyuuun..."***  
  
Hachibei... or rather, Jennifer and the others were safe.  
There were some injuries from the rubble that had flown around in the
explosion, but apparently, that caused the remaining giant creatures to
lose their will to fight and scatter.  
There were only two or three left, and the special forces captain had
judged that they were no longer a threat and didn’t pursue them. Well,
there were quite a few casualties from the battles up to that point, so
it seems pursuing them was impossible anyway.  
The technicians also suffered only minor damage, laughing that there
were only injuries from people tripping from the shock of that
explosion.  
  
Gaan! Gaan!  
***"Wau!"***  
Hachibei chimed in as I worked.  
The humans seem to be unable to move for a while as they treat the
injured and maintain their equipment, so in the meantime, I decided to
work by hand on the riverbank where the water had returned.  
Gaan!  
"―Tsubaki, I brought it!"  
"Thanks, Jennifer."  
  
After Jennifer finished treating herself, she brought what I had asked
for, so I stopped working for a moment to accept it.  
"That's the last spare, okay?"  
"Got it."  
―Crack.  
When I stood up, the black, soot-covered scales that had been covering
my body in patches peeled off, revealing unblemished, pale
copper-colored skin.  
  
Even though I can move through flame, I took considerable damage from
the shock of that explosion. But the Raijū, with its last thoughts,
demanded that I "devour it" as the victor's right, and I was able to
heal my injuries by eating its heart.  
...I don't know what it was thinking until the very end, but I think it
had its own pride in being born in this world.  
  
What Jennifer brought was a spare leather outfit.  
Yaeko is likely to scold me for already destroying new equipment, but I
don't think there's anything that could withstand that explosion. Isn't
it amazing enough that it withstood the lightning strike?  
As I was putting on the spare leather outfit that Yaeko had given me
just in case, Jennifer, who was watching, made a strange face.  
"Huh? What's wrong? Does something still hurt?"  
"No, I'm fine, and so are the other kids. If it's just this much, we'll
recover quickly after eating."  
  
Jennifer and the others on the front lines seemed to have the worst
injuries, but since their durability is higher than that of ordinary
humans, there was no damage to their internal organs, and if it's this
much, it'll heal if they eat meat, just like me and Hachibei.  
The children could eat the giant creatures they defeated, but some of
the humans were still resistant to it even after it was processed, so
the children with minor injuries had been gathering beached river fish
with Hachibei until just now.  
However, it seemed the Captain remembered that I had told him how a
Shiba Inu named Jinbei ate the processed meat and became a little
stronger, so he decided to take the initiative and eat the processed
meat of the giant creatures.  
  
"Not that, Tsubaki... your horns have grown? And your tail too."  
"Really?"  
***"Wafun?"***  
Hachibei thinks so too? Since eating the Raijū's heart, my physical
abilities seem to have grown again. Because of that, my horns have grown
slightly, and my tail has gotten a little bigger. Maybe my canine teeth
have grown a little too.  
For some reason, my body hasn't grown! Jennifer and the others will
probably overtake my height soon.  
  
"More importantly, Tsubaki, what are you doing?"  
"Making a new spear?"  
The antler spear was broken in the battle with the Raijū. It had never
broken no matter how roughly I treated it, but it seems it was too much
to ask for in that battle.  
So I tried to mend the antler spear. Using the "horn" of the Raijū that
broke at the end.  
Like the antler spear hardened by my blood, the Raijū's horn also has a
strength that humans cannot process. Still, like the bones of other
giant creatures, I think it would become brittle if the "mysterious
power" were to be lost, but that's where I thought,  
Could I use my scales? ...I mean.  
My scales are made of my blood. I crushed the scales that had peeled off
as my injuries healed into powder, used them on the part where the
broken antler spear and the Raijū's horn were joined together, and
tempered it with the "Dragon's Flame."  
  
Gaan! I hit the red-hot spear with a piece of iron frame I picked up.  
The iron frame seemed like it was going to give out first, but after
scorching it with my flames and hitting it several times, the excess
parts peeled off as soot, and even the part of the Raijū's horn turned
red.  
"Step back."  
Juaaaaa.....  
When I finally dipped it in the river water to cool it down all at once,
a new antler spear appeared. It had a cherry blossom color and a
distorted naginata-like shape.  
  
"Heeh... won’t it fall apart?"  
"...Probably."  
Did it really stick properly...? I swung it when I heard Jennifer's
remark, and the iron frame was cut in half.  
"...It cut it."  
"...Isn't the cross-section a little melted?"  
I thought the Raijū's horn would be sharp enough to cut, but if you look
closely, the cross-section was melted as if scorched by heat.  
...I should stop swinging it around when someone is nearby.  
  
And―  
"Alright, let's go!!"  
After resting for about half a day, we departed under the captain's
command.  
Having arrived at our destination without losing a single member, in
front of the giant radio tower that was so tall that we had to look up,
we renewed our determination and stepped inside.
