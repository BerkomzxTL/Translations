# 74 New Equipment

"Tsubaki, we're going too!"  
We were going to steal equipment from a giant radio tower in Tokyo.
Jennifer said this when I decided to participate in the plan, and the
children of the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit nodded in agreement.  
"But... don't you know it's dangerous?"  
"Of course, we understand."  
  
The unit heading to the giant radio tower is made up of surviving
special forces members and volunteers.  
The person who became the captain of the new special forces was not
exactly a sensible person... but still, he was a normal person who felt
guilty about using children.  
So that person didn't ask Jennifer and the others to participate in the
operation, because he hadn't been able to do anything for them who had
been treated coldly until now.  
The reason for this is that the upper echelons of this shelter still
don't know how to handle my existence. My presence by Jennifer and the
others has reduced the number of times the children are sent on
dangerous missions, but even so, they’re insisting on participating in
the operation.  
  
One of the reasons for this may be Jennifer and the others' low
self-esteem.  
The children, who have been treated coldly by adults all along and have
been made to believe that fighting is their only value, were afraid of
becoming unnecessary.  
Things have improved quite a bit, though. And the rest will be resolved
when they gain knowledge and become adults, but after all, the biggest
thing is "my" existence.  
They were treated coldly by adults, and the only person who cared about
them was me, a non-human.  
That's why Jennifer and the others, like infants clinging to their
parents, want to be more useful to me than to the human adults.  
  
"Okay... fine. But you have to eat properly and study, okay?"  
"Okay! Got it!"  
Even if I'm worried about the children, refusing them here could make
their hearts unstable again. Well, I’ll just have to do my best to
protect them.  
And then I'll leave it to Hachibei, the healing element.  
***"Wafun..."***  
Hachibei, who was still surrounded by children, gave me a sidelong
glance.  
Well, it's alright, isn't it? The normal children who have returned to
the city were looking at them with envy. The barrier between them and
the general public has been lowered quite a bit, but they're still not
able to live together yet.  
  
And so, the raid operation on the radio tower, which I, Hachibei, and
Jennifer and the others were to participate in, couldn't start right
away.  
First of all, more than half of the special forces' equipment was
broken, and it would take two weeks to repair it. In addition, there was
the replenishment of the special forces, the selection of volunteers,
the transfer of technicians to select and remove the equipment from the
radio tower, and the preparation of food, so in reality it seemed like
it would start a month later, in the fall.  
It couldn’t be helped, because manpower was also needed for the wheat
and rice harvest. When I told the person in charge of food about how I
had left some rice seeds at Aki and Rin's place, they were very
regretful about the Tohoku varieties, and it seems they’re thinking of
sending Jennifer and the others to interact with them sometime.  
  
Jennifer and the others needed to prepare as well. They’ll be provided
with the same food and other supplies as the regular soldiers, but the
equipment is a problem.  
Combat uniforms for children that are specialized for shock resistance.
The material was not a problem because it's chemical fiber, but children
grow quickly and will outgrow them quickly. Until now, they used to give
hand-me-downs to the smaller children, but the person in charge of
making the equipment said that this would cause problems with
durability.  
  
"Well, well, the cute dragon girl, right? Nice to meet you."  
"Huh..."  
The person who appeared with such a casual attitude was a female
technician in her thirties.  
What can I say, she's a rather unique person, wearing worn-out work
clothes and a dirty lab coat, with her long hair not even combed, and a
cigarette dangling from her mouth that smelled bad.  
"Do you know her?"  
"... I don't know her."  
She wasfrom the department that was preparing Jennifer and the others'
equipment, but she said she didn’t know her. The woman grinned at
Jennifer, who was hiding behind me and wary like a kitten.  
"Makes sense. I haven't introduced myself yet. Call me Yaeko. You
probably know the old geezer, but he was reluctant to update the kiddo's
equipment, so now I'm here."  
  
Apparently, the previous person in charge had been giving the special
forces products made using high-quality tools and, in return, would
receive luxury canned goods and such from the former captain of the
special forces.  
Then, with the former captain's death in battle, there was an internal
whistleblower, and with my arrival, the upper echelons and moderates,
who had become opportunistic, changed the person in charge in order to
provide the children with new equipment.  
The reason why this woman... Yaeko, became the person in charge was
because of the simplistic decision that a woman would be better for
dealing with children.  
  
"Anyway, there's new equipment, so all you kids should come with me.
Tsubaki-chan too."  
"Me too?"  
"You need new equipment too!"  
New equipment...? For me? Don't you know I can only wear leather?  
"Look, I really really want your help in making it."  
Saying that, Yaeko started walking quickly, and I and the children...
the older children above the age of nine, hurriedly chased after her.  
"First of all, your fur clothes, Tsubaki-chan, are here."  
"Why!?"  
  
Fur that doesn't get holes even when hit by bullets. It was determined
that it was the fur of a giant creature, but the fur of a giant deer can
be pierced even by the children's spears, so it's not that strong.  
So as a result of the investigation, they hypothesized that my blood had
permeated and changed its properties.  
"My blood?"  
"Right!"  
  
So they wondered if they could make strong armor by using my blood, and
asked the hospital's biological research team for a blood sample, but
the syringe wouldn't go through my skin.  
So they thought that they could strengthen the leather by using the
blood of the mutated new humans―the children―who were born after the
world mutation, just like me, and they used the blood collected during
the regular checkups to experiment.  
"Without permission..."  
"Super sorry about that!"  
  
Yaeko put her hands together and apologized to Jennifer, who was glaring
at her with a sidelong glance... but I don't see any sincerity.  
The leather that was produced by experimenting in this way wasn't as
strong as my fur outfit, though it seemed to exhibit strong durability.
But...  
"No one could wear it."  
"Huh?"  
  
Leather products that were soaked in diluted children's blood apparently
made the wearer feel uncomfortable or very unsettled.  
It couldn’t be used for the armor of soldiers who have to act carefully.
Changing the concentration or soaking time didn't improve it, and if it
was diluted too much, the effect would be lost.  
Just in case, Yaeko tried on my fur outfit, but she apparently became
sick and couldn't move.  
"... So, will you give me my clothes back?"  
"Just a little more. I want to do just a little more research, but
didn’t I say I'd rather make new armor?"  
  
Is that what it's leading to...?  
Yaeko hypothesized that since I was wearing it normally, only the person
whose blood was used could use it.  
She brought the children here to check if the person themself could wear
the prototype armor without feeling any discomfort.  
"So, Tsubaki-chan. Give me some blood."  
"Ehhh..."  
  
And then we arrived at the research institute, and the person whose
blood was used had to equip it.  
"It's mine after all..."  
"Because you're the unit commander."  
It was Jennifer's blood that was used. Jennifer, who was wearing it,
frowned deeply, but it wasn't discomfort.  
"It's very easy to wear... unfortunately."  
"Because your blood was used without permission, you know."  
  
Well, that can't be helped. There were also several other prototypes,
and the kids themselves were wearing them or exchanging them and
discussing the fit.  
"I guess it can't be helped..."  
It wasn't very pleasant, but I felt bad about letting only Jennifer and
the others do it, and I was also a little interested.  
I made a cut on my palm with my nail and put the blood into a small
vial.  
"Is this okay?"  
"It's better to have a lot, but this is enough."  
It seems that only a really small amount was needed. If it's successful,
Jennifer and the others' survival rate will increase, and my defense
power might increase too? Well, my scales are the strongest, though.  
  
And so, the children of the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit and I
provided blood, and then two weeks later, Yaeko finally contacted us to
say that the armor was complete.
