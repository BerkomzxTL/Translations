# 58 The Unseen

Snap!  
"Alright!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
To my shout, Hachibei chimed in, and with the antler spear I had stuck
into the gap of the vending machine, I pried the lid open.  
  
We continued traveling south along the river and arrived at a city.  
I'm calling it a city, but it's not a city with rows of skyscrapers and
commercial buildings. It's a relatively new residential area with many
vacant lots, and there are hardly any shops, let alone tall buildings.  
So that's how it is, so even though there was damage from giant animals,
it was only partially destroyed, and there were many buildings that were
unscathed, but anyway, there's just nothing here.  
We've only been exploring for a few hours, so maybe they're hiding
somewhere, but Hachibei was complaining of being thirsty, so I pried
open the nearest vending machine.  
  
"...Can you drink it?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
Because the plastic bottles that are over ten years old were probably
bad, I tasted the sports drink in the can before giving it to Hachibei.
At first, Hachibei was puzzled by the sweetness, but once he realized it
was easy to drink, he started gulping it down.  
I gave Hachibei something with less sweetness, and I quenched my thirst
with a juice that was almost 0 percent fruit juice. Then, Hachibei
became interested in it and began to chew up the scattered cans and
drink the contents. Well, I don't particularly intend to stop him,
but...  
"...Hachibei. Is the sweet red bean soup delicious?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
To my question, Hachibei barked happily with his mouth covered in brown
leftovers.  
  
For the time being, I’ve collected quite a bit of the supplies I
initially aimed to gather in the city.  
45-liter garbage bags, which are useful everywhere. Handy chopsticks and
spoons for cooking. A small saucepan, which is surprisingly hard to live
without. A large amount of salt and seasonings, which I absolutely
wanted. Plastic bottles for storing water. And a larger nylon bag to
store them in.  
These were things in every household, but because they’re everywhere,
it's easy to get distracted. Especially the saucepan; after going around
to a few houses, I ended up borrowing a brand new (11 years old) one
from a store.  
  
"I wonder what we should do for dinner?"  
***"Wafun?"***  
To my mutter, Hachibei tilted his head.  
The tail of the giant arapaima that I brought as a substitute for a
bento box was consumed in a few days. Like me, Hachibei seems to be able
to store up a certain amount of food, but he's also big, so he usually
consumes a lot.  
In this city, there were many houses with unlocked doors, probably
because people evacuated in a hurry, but there were hardly any canned
goods left. The few stores that there were had also been raided by other
evacuees, so nothing edible could be found.  
But well, if we go back to the river, there'll be fish, and also
crayfish and frogs, so we won't be in trouble. But, if that's the only
thing we eat, I'll get tired of it.  
  
As if invited by the setting sun, we headed west. There were hardly any
houses left, and it was all rice fields, but I also found a small
farm.  
There was also a small stream that served as an irrigation canal along
the rice fields, so I was thinking of staying around here tonight when I
suddenly noticed a stone with letters carved on it. It was placed on a
path that was covered and buried in a large amount of grass.  
"Ah, a temple... no, a shrine?"  
  
Unlike Granny's place, it hasn’t been well maintained and seems to be
being encroached upon by giant trees...  
But I've learned. I learned from Granny that there's probably leftover
New Year’s and Summer gifts that haven't been used up.  
"Hachibei-chan, let's go."  
***"Wafun...?"***  
Hachibei gave me a skeptical look as I enthusiastically pushed my way
through the overgrown former path. As we pushed our way up the slope for
about fifty meters, we found the shrine I was aiming for... but.  
***"Wafun?"***  
"Yeah... doesn't look good."  
  
Although it had escaped the encroachment of nature, the small shrine,
which had become shaded by the giantized surrounding trees, was
half-buried in a large amount of fallen leaves and rotted soil.  
I was about to leave, thinking there was probably nothing there,
but...  
***"Wafun!"***  
Hachibei started digging up the dilapidated shrine.  
"What's wrong?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
When I asked, perplexed, Hachibei turned around and wagged his tail
happily. Then he started digging up the structure again.  
Hmm? Not...playing? I don't know what's there, but if that’s what
Hachibei wants to do...  
"...I guess it can't be helped."  
  
Hachibei and I began digging up the shrine.  
Because it was shaded, there were hardly any weeds, and we pulled out
the saplings that had encroached into the grounds as much as possible,
roots and all.  
I jumped onto the roof and used the saplings as a broom to sweep off the
rotted leaves that had accumulated, while Hachibei just kept digging
with his front paws.  
I borrowed a shovel... a spade? Something with a flat tip, from a nearby
farmer's shed, gathered the fallen leaves that Hachibei had dug up in
the center, and then blew them far away with my wings.  
We continued such work for several hours. When the sun was about to set,
the cleaning was finally completed, with Hachibei holding a sapling in
his mouth and me running around sweeping.  
  
"Ooh\~~"  
***"Wafun."***  
It's strang. Even though we only cleaned it roughly, when light shone
through the gaps in the trees we pruned, it created a somewhat sacred
atmosphere.  
Hachibei was staring intently at the main hall and wagging his tail. I
know that there's nothing in the back from when we cleaned it, but does
Hachibei know something?  
"For now, let's have dinner!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
And Hachibei is most interested in "food."  
  
"Today's menu is spaghetti."  
***"Wafun?"***  
The farmer from whom I borrowed the shovel earlier seemed to be the
caretaker that managed this small shrine, and there were some gift-like
items left behind.  
A box of dried pasta that’s over ten years old, but... well, it was in a
bag, so it's probably okay. At least, it’s nothing that we, who can eat
potentially dangerous creatures raw, can't eat.  
I lit a campfire on the shrine's stone pavement, drew water from the
stream into the ridiculously large Chinese wok that I borrowed, and
boiled it relentlessly... all three bags.  
***"Wau wau!"***  
"It's, it's still okay!"  
I forcefully pushed down the noodles, which were about to overflow from
the 60cm pot after absorbing the water, and continued to boil them.
After draining the water, I dumped all the contents of the meat
sauce-like can that came with it, stirred everything together, and made
a pseudo-Bolognese.  
"See! Easy, right!"  
***"Wafun..."***  
Hachibei looked at me suspiciously at the mountain of spaghetti that was
easily enough for more than ten people.  
  
In the end, it was pretty tasty. Well, some parts were still too hard,
some parts were mushy, and there was a slightly strange smell, but
neither Hachibei nor I cared.  
I ate 20% and Hachibei ate 80%. After finishing it in a flash, we sat
around the campfire and fell asleep in a strangely peaceful mood.  
  
Then, the next morning, as we were about to leave the shrine to depart,
Hachibei wagged his tail at the two guardian dogs. To my "Dragon Eyes,"
it seemed as if the shrine's main hall was shining faintly.  
"...Let's go."  
***"Wafun!"***  
Surely, there may be something that I can't see. Something I couldn’t
see, but Hachibei was sensing.  
  
"............"  
After leaving the narrow path leading from the shrine, I was greeted by
"something" gathering there.  
A lot of "people" that I could faintly see with my focused "Dragon
Eyes"...  
Hmm... They have the shape of people, but they aren't people. The
countless beings who were once people, who had gathered from somewhere
in the purified shrine, were all staring at "me."  
Hachibei was wagging his tail happily, so they aren't bad existences.
But... it seemed that the people who had nowhere to go were relying on
me.  
"...Yeah, okay."  
  
I took a deep breath and blew out flames from my mouth.  
The bright red flames gradually shifted into a pale blue, and sent all
the beings who were once "people," scorched by the "Dragon's Flame," up
into the sky.  
***"Wafun!"***  
"Yeah, let's go!"  
Even if the encounter was accidental, surely there was a meaning behind
it.  
We grabbed our luggage and ran even more energetically towards the
south.
