# 73 A Moment Of Peace

Having repelled the swarm of giant creatures attacking the human
stronghold, the remaining creatures scattered and fled. The surviving
soldiers and the people who were still there cheered at the sight.  
The people here, because they saw me as different from humans, deployed
the military and attacked without any dialogue. Just like the people at
the old prison site, the adults saw those who didn't fit their norms as
targets for elimination, just like the giant creatures.  
As proof of that, the gazes directed at me after I defeated the giant
creatures contained a certain kind of astonishment...  
  
"Y-you!"  
That blonde girl looked at me and let out a shriek.  
―Crack...  
I looked down to see what had happened and saw that all the scales had
fallen off my body, returning me to my pale copper-colored skin. The
problem was... I didn't have my fur clothing.  
  
"Waaah!"  
Most of the scales had fallen off, and I noticed the gazes around me...
or rather, the blonde girl cried out and covered me with a large cloth
that was lying nearby.  
"Uhi..."  
But my skin didn't accept the fabric, so I instinctively tore it off,
and the women around me, seemingly coming to their senses, swarmed
around me, covering me with cloth, and scolded the men who were staring
blankly.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
...Somehow, I was accepted into a part of this shelter, almost without
me realizing.  
The ‘part’ refers to the soldiers who survived on the front lines and
the people who couldn't evacuate. Especially the women and young men.  
Well, I can kind of understand why the women accepted me, but why the
young men who were still children before the world became like this?  
  
"It's obvious! It's because Tsubaki is a girl and that..."  
"...?"  
What's obvious? Jennifer, the blonde girl, was the one who said that.  
She and her friends were staying with me. Or rather, Hachibei and I are
visiting where they live.  
***"Kyuun..."***  
"...You're popular, Hachibei."  
Currently, Hachibei was being hugged by a lot of children, and he was
being gently petted with a troubled look on his face.  
I've been thinking this since the battle, but the children's mental
state is not good. Hachibei has grown a bit, but he's still like a
stuffed animal, so I hope he can do his best with animal therapy.  
***"Wafun!?"***  
Do your best~  
Besides, the children are not only in a dangerous mental state, but
their environment is also bad.  
The dormitory is a derelict building with hardly any electricity, and
except for Jennifer, there are only children under the age of ten, and
they don't have any toys and many of them can't read.  
So by me being here, I'm protecting the children.  
  
Even though I've been accepted by a part of the population, many of the
higher-ups, who are former executives of major corporations and military
personnel, are still wary of me.  
A hard-line faction that treated children as weapons and harbored a
grudge against the giant creatures? ...Among them, the one who was
particularly cold toward the children was the captain of the special
forces who captured me, and because that person lost to the giant
creatures, the hard-liners' influence has decreased considerably, so
it's gotten much better, but the way they treat me won't change
suddenly.  
That's why I asked the women who shared their food with me to make sure
that the children were also given proper meals.  
But well, the reason such selfishness is allowed is because, now that
the special forces have been almost completely annihilated, there's no
one who can beat "me," who can defeat the giant creatures.  
  
Kang, kang.  
"Dinner's ready~"  
I knocked a frying pan with a ladle and called out, and the children who
were clinging to Hachibei came over, urged by him.  
I was cooking for the children, since, naturally, they didn't know
how.  
I'm wearing clothes, of course. My best outfit, my fur clothing,
disappeared somewhere during that commotion. When I explained the
situation, Jennifer tore some pieces off an old leather sofa and brought
them to me, so I'm now wearing them wrapped around my chest and waist.  
I'm not using a frying pan or ladle for cooking, but I just felt like
hitting it.  
  
Even if they start distributing proper food, they won't get enough right
away. Since the world became like this, plants have grown larger and
grown faster, so there seems to be enough vegetables, but since the
enclosure is limited, wheat and rice are precious and won't be
distributed right away.  
In particular, because pigs and cows have also grown huge, milk is
dependent on a small number of goats, and they can't be used for meat.
Tuna and other fish have grown huge, so they can't catch much, so animal
protein is very precious.  
"...Is this okay for cooking?"  
"It can't be helped for now..."  
  
But we can eat the meat of giant creatures.  
It emits a strange power, and even insects and microorganisms don't
swarm around it and it doesn't rot like normal creatures. According to
Jinbei's reaction before, he even hated getting close to it, but once
it’s cooked, it’ll rot normally, and normal people can eat it, but
before that, it should be difficult to process.  
  
***"Itadakimasu!"***  
As if finally remembering how hungry they were, the children started
eating the "raw meat" of the giant creatures energetically.  
It's just lightly seared on the surface and sprinkled with salt, but the
children who have adapted to this world, like me and Hachibei, seem to
feel the strange power that the giant creatures have as delicious. They
happily ate even this thing that couldn’t be called cooking, which was
just seared and cut.  
  
The giant creatures that attacked this time were mostly burned by me,
but the bodies of the large crocodiles and boars still had plenty of raw
parts left.  
Jennifer, who had no cooking experience, helped me with the cooking (?)
as everyone's "Onee-chan," but she didn't seem convinced.  
  
Jennifer's Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit was separate from the
jurisdiction of the higher-level organization, the special forces,
because the latter was barely able to act.  
Some of the upper echelons who are moderates have come to see me, but
the hard-liners still want to use Jennifer and the others to take back
the city from the giant creatures. But even those moderates feel that
"I" am both a hope and a handful in the face of the threat of giant
creatures.  
  
I'm seen as a new existence, the same as the giant creatures they
shun.  
Even Jennifer and the others, who have the same appearance and were born
from them, were treated coldly because of their aversion to giant
creatures. Some people frowned at this, but the majority of public
opinion prevented them from taking action.  
With the presence of Hachibei, who is a giant creature, albeit a docile
one, people with a strong aversion would like me to leave this shelter
if possible.  
The reason they've accepted me, even if only tentatively, is because
they're concerned about the giant creature attacks and because of the
existence of the United States.  
  
"A 'Dragon' that's different from me..."  
A moderate person told me about its existence.  
It seems that it was in the information exchanged with the US military
reconnaissance plane that visited only once, but the US military hasn't
visited since then. I don't know if the US is at its limit, or if it's
judged that Japan, which was almost completely destroyed in the
counteroffensive operation, is not necessary, but the upper echelons
here, including the existence of "me," are considering contacting them
again.  
  
"I wonder..."  
"What's wrong?"  
Jennifer, who was nearby, reacted to my words that I suddenly uttered.  
"Nn, it's nothing."  
That day, we went to the ruined city with the children whose injuries
had healed and whose minds had begun to stabilize.  
There were few books in the shelter, and there were e-books, but
Jennifer and the others weren't given tablets, which were precious
machines. So this time, along with hunting giant creatures, we came to
look for textbooks and other materials that the children could use from
a city that had been relatively less damaged.  
By the way, Hachibei is staying home. There are still children who
haven't recovered yet.  
  
For now, I'll teach them how to read and write. If I teach them
arithmetic and simple things, and if they can read books, they'll have
more options when they grow up.  
I don't know if the children will stay there or leave when that time
comes, but I thought that if they could process giant animals and make
them edible for the general public, they would create their own value.  
Right now, we've hunted a giant camel that had made its lair here, and
we're hanging it from a building to drain the blood.  
...Normal people can't eat it if we don't drain the blood. The giant
creatures we defeated in the shelter couldn't be used as food for the
general public because of that.  
  
"......"  
The existence of a "Dragon" somewhere. I don't know how that relates to
me, but the military's top brass asked me to cooperate in an operation
to seize equipment from a giant radio tower in order to contact the
United States.  
Honestly, I'm thinking, ‘Who are you to ask?’, but I also want to know
that information.  
But I had one concern. That is, the giant creatures that attacked the
shelter were afraid of "something."  
The thunderclap that Jennifer and the others heard just before the
attack...  
I felt uneasy, but I decided to participate in the giant radio tower
capture operation.
