# 60 Running

"Alright, let's go."  
***"Wafun!"***  
Even though we were attacked by a random ostrich in the middle of the
night, we managed to salvage some usable supplies from the
half-destroyed coffee shop and set off.  
Just in case, I decided to take both roasted and dried raw coffee beans
with me. If I find a book somewhere along the way, I'll study it
again.  
"Ah, hey."  
***"Waf!"***  
Suddenly, Hachibei took off, and I chased after him. I think he'd come
back on his own if I left him, but we haven’t found any food around here
yet, and it's a pain to carry Hachibei, who's already bigger than me and
has an empty stomach. ...I guess I could fly with him then. He'll just
have to give up if I burn him again.  
Even so...  
"This area is... a town, huh."  
  
I always thought it was just a village with scattered farm houses along
the national highway, but when I looked closely, there were narrow paths
buried in weeds and fallen leaves, and I could see what looked like
houses buried in the forest. Still, this area has more ground than
asphalt, unlike the city. Also, most of the houses have collapsed,
eroded by giant trees.  
The supplies are... probably no good. Since they're farmhouses, there
might be bags of grain left in the sheds, but grain from ten years ago
has probably already returned to the soil, right? And...  
"There's probably something around..."  
I feel like the encounter rate with giant creatures increases when I go
into forests and mountains.  
I thought the reason why there were so many zoo cases among the giant
animals we've encountered so far was because there aren't many large
wild animals in Japan, but wild animals are more wary than animals that
have been raised, right?  
Invasive species with no natural enemies might be similar. But I thought
that if the place was open, wild giant creatures with increased
intelligence might not approach.  
The residential areas are far from the road, so they're being swallowed
by giant trees, but the area around the road is wide and covered in tall
grasslands, so we might be attacked less often.  
  
***"Wafuu!"***  
"Okay, okay."  
Hachibei barked for me to come quickly, while he was being buried in the
surprisingly tall grass. The grass isn't so thick that it blocks my
view, but it's quite annoying.  
"Alright~!"  
I lightly infused both legs with "heat" and ran at full speed, blowing
away the waist-high grass.  
***"Waf!"***  
Seeing that, Hachibei ran through the grass as if trying to compete.
Hachibei is also a giant animal. Even if he's still a puppy, grass of
this level isn't an obstacle, and he ran through it like a lawnmower.  
I also started to have fun and joined him, blowing away the grass along
with the ground.  
***"Wafuu!"***  
"Ahaha!"  
And as the two of us ran through the grassland―  
  
DODODODODODODODODO――!  
  
A tall, giant object that looked like something I've seen before was
sprinting across the grassland next to us, a few hundred meters away.  
Is that... the giant ostrich!? It attacked the coffee shop in the middle
of the night, destroyed it, and then went somewhere, but was it still
around here?  
As I casually watched the giant ostrich sprinting across the grassland,
it suddenly turned its face towards us and flapped its wings as it
approached and ran alongside us. I instinctively braced myself, but even
though the giant ostrich was getting closer, it didn’t attack, and just
flapped its wings as if playing.  
"...Ehh~..."  
What is this? What is it thinking? I don't really understand, but does
that mean it doesn't have any hostile intentions?  
If so, that's fine, but...?  
***"Wafun!"***  
...If Hachibei is having fun, I guess it's okay. The moment I thought
that―  
  
***"――――!?"***  
  
The giant ostrich reacted to Hachibei, looked at us, and made an
expression that clearly said *I've been tricked *with its bird-like
face.  
***"GWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!"***  
"Eh, wait, why!?"  
***"Waf!?"***  
The giant ostrich expressed its anger as it ran alongside us, flapping
its wings and bumping into us.  
Hachibei and I were caught off guard and confused as we received the
attack.  
"―Ah, Hachibei!"  
***"Wau!"***  
I spotted a large "river" in the direction we were heading, and changed
course with a sharp turn.  
***"GWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!?"***  
DOPPOOOOON!  
The giant ostrich didn’t notice the river ahead, and plunged straight
in, thrashing and struggling as it was swept downstream. Hachibei and I
stared at it in amazement, and I couldn’t help but let out a sigh.  
"I don't know..."  
***"Waf..."***  
  
Well, what's done is done. For now, since there was a large river, we
decided to get food there. In other words, catching fish.  
***"Waf!"***  
Hachibei jumped into the river and caught one-meter-class fish one after
another. But as expected, most of the large fish were invasive species.
Hachibei doesn't seem to mind much, but large invasive species are
omnivorous, so their meat often smells bad.  
"So, we'll use this."  
***"Wafuu?"***  
I spread out the blue tarp I borrowed from a nearby farm and showed it
to him.  
  
Today's meal is survival food. ...Well, it always is.  
First, I used my tusk knife to scale and gut the snakehead, carp, and
catfish that Hachibei worked hard to catch. Then, I chopped off the
heads and threw them into the river, where Hachibei pounced and ate
them, as if he had been waiting for that moment.  
I washed the opened bodies, skewered them on branches, coated them with
the large amount of salt I brought, and left them for a while.  
In the meantime, I made a frame using cut-down trees and covered it with
the blue tarp.  
The smell seems strong, so it would’ve been nice to have some cherry
blossoms, but since there aren't any, I picked up fallen branches of a
beech-like tree and crushed them into small pieces.  
I lined up the dried fish inside the blue tarp, lit the beech chips,
closed the entrance, and waited for a few hours for it to be done.  
"Easy, right?"  
***"Waf?"***  
Hachibei made a pitiful face when he learned that he had to wait for a
few hours. ...After all, the fish heads weren't even a snack for him.  
"It's okay. Look."  
***"Waf!"***  
I pointed to the river, where many fish had gathered around the area
where I threw away the guts, and Hachibei happily jumped in and started
eating the fish raw. Ah, give me some too.  
  
By the time the sun went down, the moisture had been removed and the
smoked invasive fish were ready. Today, we were able to eat a lot of raw
fish, so I’ll re-grill a few for dinner over a campfire and eat them
little by little.  
"Good?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
It seems to be good. Doesn't Hachibei think everything is delicious
except for spicy things?  
Well, I thought it was delicious too, so I'll take it as a win. There
was some remaining odor, but I didn’t think it was a problem.  
"That's right..."  
While we’re here, I’ll use up the roasted coffee beans.  
***"Wafun?"***  
Hachibei tilted his head at me as I started preparing a small pot. Maybe
the reason it tasted so bad before was because it wasn't roasted enough,
so I'll roast it a little more.  
As I shook the pot, a faint, pleasant aroma wafted up. I didn’t have a
tool to grind it into powder, so after roasting, I crushed it little by
little with the handle of my tusk knife.  
I put the powder in the copper cup I brought from the coffee shop... How
much water should I use? I scooped up and boiled water from the river,
let it cool while letting the sediment settle, and then poured the clear
liquid into the cup and brewed the coffee at a boiling temperature.  
And then, letting the grounds settle just enough so the coffee didn’t
get cold... a sip.  
"Hmm... it's not bad... I guess?"  
***"Wafun"***  
***"Gwee."***  
…...Huh?  
  
***"GWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!"***  
"It's back again!?"  
Dokan!  
***"Wau!"***  
Hachibei and I jumped away from the giant ostrich, which suddenly
attacked us with its beak.  
It’s an odd guy, but if it clearly has hostile intentions, then it's my
enemy.  
"Huh...?"  
***"GWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"***  
For some reason, the giant ostrich didn't care about us, and was instead
desperately attacking the small pot.  
No, wait? It’s just attacking the coffee beans that spilled from the
overturned pot.  
This is... could it be that it was lured by the smell of coffee? But it
doesn't seem like it likes it, so maybe it hates the smell of coffee?  
***"Gwee..."***  
The giant ostrich's gaze landed on me... no, on the coffee cup I'm
holding.  
***"GWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, Gwee!!"***  
  
Seriously!? The reason it attacked the coffee shop yesterday was because
it hates the smell of coffee!?  
I instinctively ran away from the giant ostrich, which suddenly jumped
at me. No, I don't think I needed to run away, but I was running away
because I didn't understand what was going on.  
I ran at full speed with the coffee cup in my arms. The giant ostrich
chased after me.  
***"Wafun!"***  
For some reason, Hachibei was running alongside me in a cheerful mood,
thinking it was playtime.  
"Heyyyyyyy!?"  
You're a giant animal, right!? You're smart, right!? Isn’t it like, you
hate humans, or you want to eat a dragon?! Something like that,
right!?  
***"GWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!?"***  
The giant ostrich, which was running alongside me, looked surprised when
it saw me and made a face as if it had been *tricked*.  
Again!? What were you tricked by!  
  
"Hey!"  
As I ran, I threw the coffee cup I was holding into the river, and the
giant ostrich and Hachibei jumped in after it. The giant ostrich flapped
its wings as it was swept downstream.  
"Hachibei!?"  
***"Wafun"***  
Before I knew it, only Hachibei had swam back.  
I don't know...  
  
I felt a sense of exhaustion as I packed my things and decided not to
stay the night here. I left with Hachibei. I hope it doesn't come back
again.  
Later, in a picture book I found, I learned that ostriches approach
things that are running because they think they're companions, but they
attack if they're not companions. By the way, it didn't mention that
they hated coffee.  
Doesn't intelligence increase when they become giant...?
