# 71 Little Dragon

"Dragon..."  
Jennifer's dazed mutter echoed through the petrochemical complex that
had become a battlefield.  
Before her eyes was a single "aberration." It still had a human shape,
but its entire body was covered in bright red scales, with horns, a
tail... and wings to soar through the sky.  
―Truly, it was the form of a "dragon" from legend, as humans imagine
it―  
  
***"――――――――――――――――――――"***  
The girl, transformed into a dragon, roared with a "voice" that humans
could not understand.  
It wasn't the soul-shaking roar that Jennifer had experienced before.
But that roar stirred the soul, and even the giant beasts that had been
trying to attack humans stopped and turned to look.  
What the giant beasts felt wasn't the melody of inspiration and awe that
Jennifer felt, but the selection of the "dragon", the pinnacle of all
predators.  
  
Not the "dragon's roar" that selects who may stand before the "Dragon,"
but the "Dragon's Song" to select foolish adversaries who would dare to
oppose it....  
  
In that instant, flames erupted around the small dragon, leaving only
streaks of fire before the "dragon" vanished with a speed that escaped
the eye. In a flash, it seized the head of a giant black panther that
had shown a moment of fear. It slammed the giant beast, more than ten
times its own size, into the ground, and crushed its skull.  
Having killed the giant black panther in one blow, the giant beasts were
overcome with terror at the "Dragon's Eyes" glaring at them.  
  
***"――――――――――――――――――――――――!!!"***  
The humanoid "dragon" roared.  
Spewing explosive flames from its scaled wings, the "dragon" shot forth,
seized the neck of a giant lioness that was in its path, and tore it off
in an instant.  
Flames engulfed the giant lioness, with fire was erupting from the
wound.  
The wings spewing flames roared, and the "dragon" shot into the sky like
a cannonball, slicing through the clouds at supersonic speed. Then
plunged straight down, crashing into the ground with an impact that blew
away the hordes of giant beasts.  
Explosions erupted as if missiles had been fired, instantly swallowing,
blowing away, and turning to ash the hordes of giant beasts left unable
to resist.  
Within that hellfire, only the "dragon" roared to the heavens, seeking
its next prey.  
  
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
At that sight, one of the special forces suddenly began to fire wildly
at the "dragon."  
As expected, the bullets softened from the intense heat and couldn't
even scratch the scales, but that gunfire prompted the surrounding
special forces members to begin attacking the "dragon" as if they had
reached their limit.  
  
"W-What are you doing?!"  
Jennifer frantically shouted to stop them, but some of the half-crazed
members pointed their guns even at Jennifer's Giant Beast
Countermeasures Unit, and even the calm captain among them, with
bloodshot eyes and foam at his mouth, began to fire his own assault
rifle.  
"Do it, eaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!"  
  
―The "Dragon's Song"―  
The roar that selects the enemy inflicts fear and confusion on those who
harbor hostility or malice toward the "Dragon."  
Confused by this, the special forces members attacked the "dragon" out
of "fear," and even when the members who retained their sanity tried to
stop them, those who had lost their minds saw them as enemies as well.  
Amidst this, some of the special forces members charged at the "dragon"
while screaming.  
***"――――――――――"***  
The "dragon" glared at them, spread its wings, and swept away the
charging special forces members with a blast of flame, causing them to
collapse.  
  
"...What...is this?"  
Jennifer muttered in astonishment at the sight of the "dragon" that had
been single-handedly slaughtering the giant beasts that had only been
terrifying existences until now, and that showed no mercy even to humans
who opposed it.  
A "dragon" in human form. A "human" in dragon form...  
Jennifer was confused that the kind person who had been the only one to
care for her on the battlefield had become an existence that merely used
violence.  
"Could it be..."  
Jennifer realized that the person who had become the "dragon" was not in
her right mind.  
Did something happen during the capture? Or did they do something to her
at the research institute? She didn't know the reason, but she
understood that her current state was not favorable.  
  
"What about the others?!"  
Jennifer, who had been confused by the extraordinary situation, finally
remembered her comrades.  
"Everyone, retreat for now! Quickly!"  
Jennifer, who had picked up the boy who had lost consciousness while
protecting her, shouted, and those who could move began to retreat,
carrying the injured.  
Most of the giant beasts were focused on the "dragon" and the rampaging
special forces. It seemed that there were no dead comrades yet, but who
knew what would happen if they were attacked now.  
Now that the captain was out of his mind, it was an opportunity to
retreat. However...  
(Is this okay...?)  
For a moment, her feet froze, fearing that if the base suffered
significant damage, they might lose their place.  
At that moment―  
"Jennifer!!"  
Someone called out to her. A shadow fell from above, and when she looked
up, she saw a giant goral, its body half-burned, looking down at her
with eyes full of hatred.  
***"Bueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!!"***  
The giant goral brayed and swung its head down at Jennifer, who was
carrying her companion and unable to move.  
  
―Dogoon!!  
  
"...Eh?"  
At that moment, something large suddenly jumped in from the side and
knocked the defenseless giant goral away.  
The "thing," which was the color of nicely toasted bread and as big as a
house, puffed out its chest, put down the package it had been carrying
in its mouth; barking once.  
  
***"Wafun!"***  
  
"............Huh?"  
The giant beast, which looked like a Shiba Inu puppy she had seen in an
e-book encyclopedia when her family was still alive, sniffed Jennifer's
scent and tilted its head with round eyes while wagging its tail.  
"Y-You're..."  
If she remembered correctly, it should be the giant beast that was with
the dragon person. Why had it appeared here?  
She didn't know, but Jennifer realized that the reason she wasn't being
attacked was the "antler spear" that she had brought as a good luck
charm and kept strapped to her back.  
  
***"Kyuu~n?"***  
The giant Shiba Inu looked around, spotted the "dragon" rampaging in the
flames, and its expression lit up. Jennifer hastily tried to get in
front of the giant Shiba Inu, which had re-gripped the package and began
to trot towards it.  
"W-Wait!"  
Even if it seemed to be fond of the dragon person, it was still a giant
beast, and she didn't know what it was thinking or when it would bare
its fangs at them. But she couldn't easily lose an existence that might
be able to do something about the current dragon person.  
More than that...  
"That person isn't right in the head right now! You'll be killed if you
go!"  
At those innocent, round eyes and adorable gestures, Jennifer found
herself not wanting to let this existence die.  
"U-Um..."  
"I'll help!"  
Perhaps because they were children, the children who had free hands
tried to stop the giant Shiba Inu's actions, but due to the difference
in size, they were dragged along and left behind.  
  
***"――――――――――――――!"***  
At that moment, the "dragon," which had been tearing apart and burning a
giant boar, noticed the newly appeared "giant Shiba Inu."  
Spewing flames from its wings, the "dragon" attacked in one burst.  
But―  
***"Wafun"***  
The sharp claws stopped just before it as the giant Shiba Inu barked
once, and from the package that the tail-wagging giant Shiba Inu had
dropped and unwrapped, a heart that was big enough to embrace fell
out.  
***"Wafun!"***  
The "dragon," with another bark from the giant Shiba Inu, slowly picked
up the giant heart, devoured it greedily, and perhaps because its hunger
was satisfied, the scales on its face and abdomen began to peel off,
revealing the face of a bewildered girl.  
  
"...Hachibei!?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
Hachibei jumped on his partner who had returned to normal, and licked
Hanatsubaki’s cheek.
