# 66 Ambush

Petrochemical complex, military headquarters.  
It was an armed group formed by the U.S. military and the Self-Defense
Forces, one of the ruling classes in this petrochemical complex area,
and an organization that aimed to protect the area.  
However, there were only less than 2,000 original military personnel,
and although they were conscripting from refugees, it wasn't enough to
counter the threat of the giant beasts.  
  
"Is it correct that the "Unknown" had horns and a reptilian tail?"  
"That is correct."  
To the words of the Black male, a former U.S. soldier, a seemingly
Japanese man nodded solemnly from among the multiple staff officers
gathered.  
  
Eleven years had passed since the world's mutation, and the giant
beasts' rampage had subsided into a lull as they were wary of and fought
each other. But that wasn't a good thing for the humans. It meant that
"humans," the common enemy of the giant beasts, had decreased in number
to the point where they could no longer resist.  
  
Countries with large populations could no longer import food and fuel,
and were almost completely destroyed. Many developing countries that had
preserved nature were overrun by giant beasts and no longer exist.  
The only places that still retained the form of a nation were those that
were able to quickly abandon their people. Even in those countries, they
were just eating away at what they had, and there was no prospect for
the future.  
How many of the human species are left in this world? Were they just
waiting to be eaten by giant beasts and perish?  
But humans had not yet given up.  
  
In order for humans to regain power, world-scale cooperation was
necessary. Like this region, the military and corporations moved quickly
to secure stockpiled fuel and were able to preserve the technology and
lifestyle from before the world's mutation to some extent, but that was
only a temporary measure.  
How many years can we use the current reserves? Even if we can secure
other safe stockpiled fuel regions, how many decades will it last? It
will surely run out someday.  
Solar power generation had become considerably less efficient due to the
lifespan of the panels. The safe dams around the world could no longer
discharge water without people to manage them, causing them to collapse
and causing many casualties.  
  
Fortunately, however, the oil-producing regions of the Middle East did
not have many large animals that had grown to a huge size, and giantized
livestock had been separated due to the climate, so the area was
supposedly relatively stable.  
The United States lost 70% of its states, but the survivors united and
were now starting to mass-produce biofuel.  
That information came from the United States. The communication network
had no relay stations, and most of the satellites were no longer useful,
but the United States used the sky with few giant beasts and made
efforts to collect information using large long-distance aircraft.  
At that time, an aircraft that reached Japan established communication,
and information was obtained. However, the aircraft could not land in
Japan, which had no safe runways or aviation fuel, and the aircraft
returned to the United States after communicating for about several tens
of minutes.  
That was three years ago... Since then, no aircraft visited again, and
it was uncertain how many human forces remained.  
However... in the information that was compressed and sent during that
communication, there was a description of the cause of the world's
mutation.  
  
Eurasia. In the depths of that continent where a great power perished,
they saw something like a giant "dragon"...  
  
"Make contact with that ‘Unknown.’ If necessary, dispatch a special
forces unit to capture it for research."  
  
＊＊＊  
  
"Let's go!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
When I shouted loudly at the sun, which I hadn't seen in a long time,
Hachibei wagged his tail happily.  
  
I had decided on our next destination, but I needed to prepare to head
there. There was a safe used car dealer, so I took the kei truck there,
refilled it with relatively decent gasoline, and did simple maintenance
such as an oil change. I guess the gasoline was old or the maintenance
was insufficient, but I felt like the oil was dirty...  
While I was doing the maintenance, a typhoon hit directly. Luckily, I
was able to manually lower the shutters, so Hachibei and I waited for it
to pass while consuming the meat of the giant female lion.  
The meat was supposed to be for lunch...  
  
―Brrrnn.  
So the typhoon passed and it was a clear day for the first time in a
while.  
Somehow the kei truck was in good condition, and I started driving
energetically with Hachibei running alongside, wagging his tail.  
"............"  
***"Wau."***  
The road surface was muddy from the typhoon. Hachibei was also covered
in mud. Several times the tires got stuck in the mud, and I had to push
it each time.  
Still, after a few hours, the soil on the road surface dried, and when I
could drive properly, I noticed on the map that there was a large lake
ahead of us.  
  
"Let's take a little detour."  
***"Wafun!"***  
After calling out to Hachibei, we set course toward the lake.  
However, even though we've entered the Kanto region, it's not becoming
urban at all. Maybe it's also because we came through the national road
instead of getting near the station, but the area was full of low-rise
buildings that looked like residential areas.  
But, I feel like there are more and more old, large houses. There are
fields around here, so it seems like you could live by digging a well...
but, I guess civilization can't be forgotten after all, huh.  
The closer to the city, the more of these people there were, and perhaps
they believed that civilization still remained further south, and so
they were attacked by giant animals and disappeared.  
  
"You're getting a bath!"  
***"Wafu!?"***  
As soon as we arrived at the lake, I carried Hachibei and threw him with
all my strength. ...About fifty meters.  
I rushed to the water's edge, following Hachibei, who landed with a big
splash, and Hachibei, who jumped out of the water, splashed water on
me.  
"Buha!"  
***"Wafu!"***  
While playing like that, we washed away each other's mud, and while
grilling the fish Hachibei caught over a campfire, I also hung the
washed fur on the spear to dry.  
  
***"Wafu?"***  
"What's wrong?"  
When I turned my eyes in the direction Hachibei was looking, there was
something floating in the sky on the other side of the lake...  
It's not a bird... Somehow the movement seems artificial.  
"I wonder what that is..."  
Thinking so, when I focused my consciousness as if searching for
"presence," I was able to notice a faint something that was different
from animals or fish.  
  
When I noticed that "presence," I felt a sense of discomfort with it.  
It was a clinging feeling that I had noticed since I left the town where
I fought the children and serviced the kei truck.  
...Someone was watching us. No, I don't think they could’ve started
moving immediately and easily found us, who had been in the maintenance
shop the whole time. So...we were ambushed?  
Who is it? A giant animal with intelligence? Or... those who have the
technology to make that artificial object flying in the sky... humans?  
  
"...Let's move."  
***"Wafu?"***  
I called out to Hachibei, who was eating a raw freshwater fish that
looked like trout. I grabbed the skewer of grilled fish and crunched it
as it was and got into the kei truck.  
For now, let's move from here. I was going to contact them myself, but
being passive somehow doesn't feel right.  
  
We returned along the river that flows into the lake, and started
crossing the long bridge. Perhaps because I wanted to get away quickly,
the bridge, which was about a hundred meters long, felt very long.  
The abandoned cars that were left there also became annoying. Just a
little more, just a few more meters... And then, as I crossed the bridge
and stepped on the accelerator to increase the speed, I saw an
artificial object in the sky beyond the windshield.  
  
―Doooooooon!!  
  
"――!?"  
Kyi, kyiii!! Suddenly the car body tilted and the steering wheel was
pulled. Did the tire puncture!? No, that's not a puncture sound.
That's!  
***"Uuuu!"***  
I hurriedly got out of the car and found Hachibei growling warily
towards the ruins.  
I also held up my antler spear and glared in that direction, and from
the shadow of the ruins, a dozen or so "adults" with the same equipment
as those children appeared and pointed their weapons at me.
