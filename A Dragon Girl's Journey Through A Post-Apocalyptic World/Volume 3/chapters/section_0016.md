# 72 Dragon Person

***“Wafu!”***  
"Yeah, let's do it."  
Hachibei and I braced ourselves against the surviving giant creatures
that surrounded us warily.  
Judging from the number of corpses, about half of them had been taken
down by "me" going on a rampage, but there were still over twenty
left.  
  
I was fully awake. It wasn't like I didn't remember anything at all.  
I vaguely remembered what happened after I was captured that time. It
felt like watching it in a dream, so some of it might be from the dream,
but I still understood that this was the petrochemical complex we were
heading towards, and that it was a base for humans.  
And that this place was currently being attacked by giant creatures. And
that "I" had been rampaging as a "Dragon"...  
I don’t understand why they hadn't run away, given how much damage they
had taken, but I’ll eliminate these nuisances for now.  
  
"...U-um,"  
A voice called out from behind me as I was about to dash forward. At the
same time, I felt a familiar "presence," and when I turned around, the
blonde girl was holding something out to me with a sorry look on her
face.  
"My antler spear..."  
Did this girl pick it up for me? My other partner. The "antler spear,"
which had become more reddish with use and was now a reddish ivory
color, I nodded and accepted.  
"W-we too..."  
The girl and the children who were not yet badly injured readied their
weapons. Were they going to fight with me? But...  
"It's okay."  
She had a desperate look on her face. The hostility she had shown at
first was already gone, and more importantly, I didn't feel any malice
from them.  
Their appearance reminded me of Aki and Rin, and I reflexively stroked
their heads, causing them to widen their eyes in surprise.  
"I'll take them down."  
  
The peeling bright red scales covered my limbs. When the scales covered
from my waist to my back, my wings spread out again, and flames spewed
out from the gaps in the scales.  
Daan!!  
***“Gyagyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?”***  
Propelled by the force of the flames, I jumped forward and pierced the
giant boar right between its eyebrows with my spear.  
Even with that, the giant animal didn't die instantly. The red-hot
antler spear blew flames from the wound, burning the giant boar's head
to ashes.  
***“Gaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!”***  
From the side, a giant hyena attacked. I pulled out the antler spear
while dodging the hyena's claws, and blew its face off with a sweep of
my tail.  
Taking advantage of the gap in that attack, a giant hippopotamus jumped
at me, trying to crush me with its massive body.  
"Haaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!"  
I inhaled deeply, and showered the giant hippopotamus with inescapable
flames.  
***“Bumoaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!”***  
The giant hippopotamus, pushed back by the force of the flames, was
instantly engulfed, its entire body burned. It rolled around, writhing
in agony, before dying in the flames.  
What a waste! Including the ones I defeated when I was a "Dragon," most
of the edible parts are burned!  
  
"Then―‘Cut'!"  
I placed one hand on the ground, stretched my tail out horizontally, and
spewed the "heat" from my wings like a jet engine.  
With that momentum, I flew straight through, and the sharp scaled wings
sliced off the heads of the giant deer and the giant antelope.  
―Zusasaaaaaaa!\*  
My scale-covered feet scraped against the asphalt as if to brake, and,
still flying straight, I cleaved the giant leopard and the giant black
leopard in two.  
  
My body feels light. My physical abilities and physical strength have
also improved.  
I don't know the reason why the "Dragon" inside me awakened, but the
awakened power was sufficient for me, even in my current state, to
defeat the giant creatures.  
  
***“Grrr…”***  
The remaining giant animals finally became afraid of me as I had
annihilated the remaining third of them in the blink of an eye.  
No, it seemed like they had been afraid of "something" from the
beginning, but now, the fear of me, who was in front of them and killing
them, began to outweigh it.  
Hachibei was also cooperating with the children to defeat the giant
lioness. Everyone was injured, but their will to fight was still
stronger.  
  
***“Gaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!”***  
The last remaining giant lioness roared―and then ran towards the broken
wall without fighting, and the remaining giant creatures began to
scatter in pursuit.  
But―  
"Not that way!!"  
A distressed voice rang out from the blonde girl who had noticed.  
Beyond that was... a town!?  
  
The last large giant creature, a giant rhinoceros, lost its escape route
and ran towards the town where people were, with a body as large as a
large bus. Not only that, but several giant deer and giant horses
followed.  
If I adjusted the angle now, could I shoot the giant rhinoceros in the
head with a flash of "Dragon's Breath"?  
"No way!"  
The town where people lived was under an oil storage tank. I didn't know
if there was still oil left in it, but if I shot it, it would hit it!  
"Then!"  
I spewed flames from my wings and chased after the giant rhinoceros.
Hurry!!  
  
\*\*\*  
  
"I..."  
The special forces and their captain, freed from the terror of the
"Dragon's Song," tried to understand the situation, though still
dazed.  
Probably that "monster" they had captured had escaped, taking advantage
of the giant beast attack. And, colluding with the giant beasts, it
attacked them, and did something like hypnotism to rob them of their
consciousness.  
"That's why something like that should be frozen as soon as
possible..."  
"C-Captain!"  
The captain, who was trying to shift the blame for his own failure in
anger and dissatisfaction, was called out by a desperate voice from his
subordinate.  
"What is it..."  
There was no need to ask. The captain, noticing the vibrations and
rushing sounds approaching from under his feet, turned around and
realized that a giant rhinoceros beast was approaching.  
  
"E-engage it!!"  
Having been in this position before the anomaly, he gave the order
immediately.  
Even though it was a large giant beast, it was only one. If they used
the remaining machine guns and explosives, they could at least stall it.
The captain judged that, but what he heard was not a repetition or the
sound of gunfire to engage it, but the screams of the soldiers who were
running away as fast as they could.  
"What are you―"  
―Doing? The voice that was about to shout in anger stopped.  
The members of the squad who were reluctant or even rebellious about
capturing the "monster" without speaking to it were not affected by the
"Dragon's Song" that selected enemies, and so they left the scene to
stop the giant beast together with the regular soldiers.  
And the soldiers who had been obedient to the captain had been selected
by the "Dragon's Song," which caused them to panic and charge
recklessly, resulting in most of them being unable to fight.  
  
"Ah, I..."  
―Dododododododododododododododododododododododododododododo!  
The captain was unable to finish what he was about to say, as he was
knocked away by the giant rhinoceros, and the surviving soldiers who had
fled were trampled and blown away by the giant beasts following
behind.  
His internal organs crushed by that blow, the captain, spitting blood as
he flew through the air, remembered why he had initially picked up a
weapon.  
He had lost his wife and children in the giant beast attack, and had
taken up arms out of hatred for the giant beasts and the world, but he
remembered that at first, he had wanted to protect someone... his
family.  
In the captain's eyes, flying through the blue sky, was the figure of a
bright red "Dragon."  
(Ah... how beautiful...)  
  
\*\*\*  
  
There were soldiers protecting the residents. Even so, they were unable
to evacuate everyone to the back, and many people were late in
escaping.  
Using my wings, I flew over the heads of the giant creatures in one go,
jumped down a little in front of the soldiers who were protecting the
residents, and, spreading my wings wide as if to protect them,
shouted.  
"Hachibei!! Everyone, get out of the line of fire!!"  
If I said this much, Hachibei would understand.  
Believing that my "partner (Hachibei)" was hurriedly evacuating the
children, I turned my voice into a roar.  
  
"―Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!"  
  
The "heat" of my entire body gathered in my mouth, and the roar was
released as a flash of light.  
The band of light, probably as big as a person’s wingspan―"Dragon's
Breath"―pierced through the giant rhinoceros that was coming straight
towards me, and burned the giant creatures behind it to death in an
instant.  
That flash of light did not stop, blowing away several giant creatures
that were trying to escape from the destroyed wall, burning them to
ashes.  
  
"...Is it over?"  
I murmured, as the aftereffects of the attack shook the air like a heat
haze.  
There were no giant creatures rampaging within sight, and the giant
creatures that had been fighting with Hachibei and the general soldiers
and had lost their escape route had also fled through the broken wall
after seeing my "Dragon's Breath."  
We finally won. When I exhaled, after a moment of silence, a scream-like
voice rang out from behind.  
There were still humans...  
I remembered my appearance and what I had done. I guess they can't be
like Granny after all, huh.  
But...  
"...Eh?"  
  
When I turned around at that scream, there were people there, not
screaming, but smiling and cheering.
