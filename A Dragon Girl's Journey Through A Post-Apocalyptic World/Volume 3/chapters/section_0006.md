# 62 The Signs of Summer

Our journey has been smooth since we got the kei truck. It's hard to get
decent gasoline, and it's not very fast, but it's good for carrying a
lot of stuff.  
Even so, Hachibei's weight, even as a puppy, is considerable. It was a
close call even for the kei truck, but I was able to pack more luggage
than if I had carried it by hand.  
The problem is...  
***"Wafu..."***  
Is it that Hachibei is worn out by the heat?  
It was still spring when we left Jinbei's place, but it's going to be my
second summer.  
As a dragon, I'm fine even in fire, but Hachibei is fluffy and
experiencing summer for the first time. He was slumped in the back of
the kei truck, exposed to the scorching sun while we were traveling
south on the national highway.  
"...Shave your fur?"  
***"Wafu!?"***  
  
Well, I was (half) joking, but Hachibei seemed to hate it so much that
he rolled off the truck bed to distance himself. What? So you’re fine.  
It's typical for fluffy dogs to look scrawny when their fur is shaved,
but I know. He's been eating good food lately, so his belly is in
trouble. A normal dog might not care, but a highly intelligent giant
animal might be concerned. That wolf mom would definitely care.  
Could it be?  
"Will your mom scold you for not being wolf-like?"  
***"...Waf."***  
I knew it. Still...  
"Summer heat, huh..."  
***"Wafuu..."***  
  
The kei truck has air conditioning, but it hasn't been maintained, so
it's moldy, and Hachibei won’t fit in the passenger seat anyway.  
What kind of food would give him energy? Vitamins? He eats quite a bit
of vegetables, but is it different from that? He's a dog, so… meat would
probably be better, but for beating summer heat, pork is good, right?  
Pigs must have grown to be giant-sized, but I've never seen one, so I
think they've probably become food for carnivores or something in the
last ten years.  
We ate all the smoked fish a long time ago, so what should we do?  
"...Hmm?"  
After driving south for a while and passing through a small town, I saw
a river again.  
...I've encountered giant animals several times in wide rivers, so to be
honest, I don’t have a good impression of them. But if he eats fresh
fish raw, Hachibei might feel better, so I stopped the kei truck. At
that moment, I noticed a scent tickling my nose. This is—  
"Hachibei, let's go to the sea!"  
***"Wafu?"***  
  
There were no buildings around the river, and when I strained my eyes
along the grassy riverbank, I could see something that looked like the
sea in the distance.  
I want to eat seafood again after a long time, and I want Hachibei to
eat it too. With my current abilities, I should be able to catch a lot
if I have a net.  
"Let's go."  
***"Wafu!"***  
There seemed to be an embankment that looked like a promenade along the
grassy riverbank, but it was impossible for the kei truck to go there,
so Hachibei happily chased after me as I started running.  
...He's fine after all.  
However, there was nothing. There was nothing but the wind turbines and
grassland that were along the way.  
***"Wafun!"***  
"What's wrong?"  
Hachibei stopped me just as we were approaching the sea. Huh? ...A ship?
A fishing boat?  
"...A fishing port?"  
I thought fishing ports were located facing the sea, but there was an
L-shaped fishing port that seemed to carve out the side of the river.  
As expected, the ships are rotten, and there’s nothing new, but perhaps
the reason why there are so few fishing boats is that the people that
stayed behind tried to catch fish. They were probably attacked by giant
creatures.  
Hachibei looked curious at the smell of the tide, which he was smelling
for the first time, and I slowly walked along while looking at the
remnants of human life.  
"Shall we go to the sea?"  
***"Wafu!"***  
  
It's hard to imagine there being any big fish in such a secluded fishing
port. When I peeked into the water, it was pitch black and I could only
see overgrown seaweed.  
"...Huh?"  
I saw the wreckage of what looked like a ship in the gap between the
seaweed. This is....  
"―――!?"  
At that moment, something like a shining "eye" from the bottom of the
sea at the port shot at me.  
  
SPLAAAAASHHHHHHH!!!!  
  
"Giant creature!?"  
***"Wau!"***  
A jet-black "pillar" suddenly appeared, shot out with a large spray of
water, and disappeared again back into the water.  
Next to on-guard Hachibei, I held up my antler spear.  
What was that? The total length was more than ten meters.... Because of
the spray, I could only see a slender shadow like a snake, but can sea
snakes grow that big?  
If it's not a sea snake, then it's probably a moray eel....  
A carnivorous fish with a ferocious appearance, known as the gangster of
the sea. But contrary to its appearance, it's quite delicious, according
to a new "knowledge" that popped into my head.  
I came to catch fresh fish to prevent summer heat fatigue, but why does
it have to be like this? As I was muttering to myself, the presumably
giant moray eel surfaced again and attacked me.  
  
SPLAAAAASHHHHHHH!  
"―Tch."  
The jet-black shadow that jumped out after us knocked over an abandoned
car and disappeared into the water again.  
***"Wau!"***  
Hachibei pounced on the black shadow that had jumped out again, and I
also rushed in holding my antler spear. But—  
Sliiiiiiip.  
"Eh..."  
***"Wafu!?"***  
Hachibei's fangs and the spear slid on the surface of the black shadow,
and the attacks missed.  
I called Hachibei back and retreated to the wide parking lot as the
black shadow disappeared into the water again with swift movements.  
"HAAAAAA!!"  
With cracking sounds, my arms and legs were covered with bright red
scales, and "heat" like flames erupted from the gaps in the scales.  
  
SPLAAAAASHHHHHHH!  
  
The surface of the water erupted once again, and I crashed into it
head-on with my scorching hot antler spear.  
Bashuu!!  
The mucus on the surface evaporated in an instant, piercing the head of
the black shadow... but, huh? This is...?  
A jet-black, smooth body surface. A long, wriggling creature still
convulsing violently.  
"An eel!?"  
  
Are there eels in the sea!? No, it's a river up to a point, but is it
okay either way!? Do they only go to the sea when they lay eggs!? And
this isn't a normal eel, it's a giant mottled eel!? Can they grow this
big!?  
"Haaah..."  
***"Wau!"***  
As I sat down, completely exhausted, Hachibei wagged his tail, asking if
he could eat it.  
"It should be delicious... probably."  
  
In the middle of the spacious parking lot, I used my spear to pin it
down and open it up all at once with my scaled arm and claws. Ummm? I
don't have a steamer, so I guess I'll cut it open on the belly side.  
"Don't eat it raw."  
***"Kyuun."***  
I think the blood is poisonous, so you can't eat it raw, right? I ended
up cutting the meat into chunks, and then grilling it on skewers for
almost half a day, but it was delicious.  
  
In the end, it turned out to be an eel instead of a sea fish, but thanks
to that, Hachibei, who was feeling a bit of summer heat fatigue,
regained his energy.  
The next day, after playing in the sea all day long, when I tried to
load the remaining large amount of meat into the kei truck and set
off...  
—Brrrrr....  
"Huh?"  
When I checked the kei truck, which was moving slowly, I found that the
tires were half-sunken.  
"Hachibei..."  
***"Wafu..."***  
When I nonchalantly stuck my hand into his fur and pinched his squishy
belly, Hachibei hid his face with his front paws as if he was ashamed.  
"Is this also the cause of summer heat fatigue..."  
I realized that the cause of everything was Hachibei's excessive weight
and lack of exercise, so from then on, Hachibei ended up running outside
the kei truck.  
Even if you have a means of transportation, you still need exercise.  
Do your best, Hachibei!
