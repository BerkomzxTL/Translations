# 76 City Of Ruins

"What's Tokyo like now?"  
"I've only been there once, and I don't know the old Tokyo so I can't
tell the difference, but it was just huge."  
  
In order to seize the equipment needed for long-distance communication
from the giant radio tower, we were currently heading to the ruins of
Tokyo. I was riding in an armored truck with the children of Jennifer's
Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit.  
Even though it's called a truck, it's surrounded by walls instead of a
tarpaulin, and there are proper simple seats even though there’s no
windows. It's a bit cramped because it's carrying equipment, but the
ride isn't bad. ...It's not bad, but the roads are either cracked or
buried in dirt, so it's quite bumpy.  
The soldier driving said that we couldn’t go faster on such roads, and
we have to be wary of giant animal attacks, so even the distance that
would’ve taken half a day before the mutations will take about two days
to arrive.  
  
Well, there's not much point in me riding in the truck. Hachibei was
happily running outside, and his Shiba Inu-like appearance seemed to be
popular with the old soldiers who were familiar with pre-mutation Shiba
Inus. He was jumping at jerky-like treats thrown from the windows.  
Once, I got tired of riding in the truck and tried running with
Hachibei, but I was stopped by the Special Forces Captain along the way.
He begged me to stop because it would distract the driver and was bad
for the eyes.  
What do you mean, bad for the eyes!?  
I'm hiding things properly!  
  
Anyway, back to the present, present-day Tokyo seems to be a giant ruin,
as expected.  
I only know the old Tokyo through "knowledge", but I think it's like the
cities in Tohoku near Granny's place, with most of it swallowed up by
giant trees and only tall buildings sticking out. But when Jennifer says
it’s *big*, does she just mean that there are a lot of tall buildings?  
Conversely, other residential areas were swallowed up by the forest, and
almost all supplies were wiped out, apparently.  
  
"When we came here before, we came to get 'electronic components'? We
collected thousands of small things called 'smartphones' and went
home."  
"So you collect those kinds of things too."  
I wonder if mass production of electronic products is impossible even at
the petrochemical complex. Just being able to refine fuel and generate
electricity is a good cheat base, though.  
"But I was also forced to collect a lot of alcohol and tobacco, so I
wonder if there were a lot of people like Yaeko."  
"...That's right."  
  
I guess people still want luxury goods. Even if sake brewing and tobacco
production become possible in the future, those kinds of luxury goods
will become valuable, and anything left in the ruins that's edible will
be even more valuable.  
Come to think of it, the previous Special Forces Captain was eating
fancy canned goods, right? I'd never seen anything like that before, but
maybe they were left in department stores?  
Ah, the canned goods at the house of the parishioner at Granny's place
seemed like luxury items. There wasn't any caviar, of course... If
sturgeon got giant, maybe we wouldn't be able to eat it anymore.  
  
"―Hmm?"  
"Tsubaki, what's wrong?"  
Jennifer and the other children looked at me with puzzled expressions as
I suddenly turned my face somewhere from inside the truck, where it
wasn't possible to see outside.  
"It's a giant beast. The 'presence' is getting closer."  
"―!"  
The children jumped into action at my words, which I muttered without
any particular tension. Jennifer ran to the communication device and
raised her voice.  
"This is Jennifer of The Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit! Tsubaki has
sensed the presence of a giant beast!"  
*"――Understood. Can you tell how many there are?――"*  
"Tsubaki―one!"  
She turned around, and I held up one finger, and she reported
immediately.  
Wow... Jennifer, you're really like a soldier.  
*"――Can The Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit move?――"*  
"Yes, of course―"  
  
"You don't need to go out, Jennifer and everyone. Hachibei and I will
defeat it."  
I think Hachibei might be able to defeat it on his own, but... is it
still too dangerous? As I thought about it and tried to stand up with my
antler spear, Jennifer grabbed my hand.  
"We'll go out to check the new equipment. ―Captain! We're going out!"  
*"――Understood. We'll keep an eye on the surroundings――"*  
  
Immediately, all vehicles were ordered to stop, and the children jumped
out of the truck with weapons in hand.  
Well, I guess it's okay. With that equipment, they shouldn't get
seriously injured even if they get hit directly... but I'm still going
to go watch.  
Having made that decision, I also got out of the truck, and Jennifer,
without any specific instructions, figured out the direction from the
way I was facing. She lined up diagonally to the right in front of me,
with the older children at the center.  
"...It's here."  
The moment I felt It, a black shadow burst out of the forest in the
direction the children were heading, blowing away the leaves.  
***"Bmooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!"***  
  
What jumped out was a 5 meter tall... cow? ...No, it's not a normal cow.
Maybe a water buffalo? Unlike the cows in my "knowledge," its entire
body was muscular, and one of its horns was broken.  
Cows themselves are often targeted by other giant beasts, but the scars
all over its body and its "presence" showed that it was a powerful
individual that had survived harsh battles. Perhaps because of this, it
seemed to have a fierce temperament, and despite being a herbivore, it
attacked us on purpose because it had a grudge against humans.  
...Is this another zoo case? Or maybe a safari park?  
  
"Fire!!"  
***"Bmooooooooooo!!"***  
Jennifer wasn’t the only one in the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit
with a gun anymore. Several children, wielding high-caliber rifles, the
kind used for hunting bears, fired at the head of the charging giant
water buffalo and stopped its movement.  
"Spear team!"  
At Jennifer's voice, the stronger children jumped out with steel spears
and slashed at its legs.  
For a normal human, even an adult would only be able to inflict
scratches at best, but the attacks of the children with high physical
abilities inflicted deep wounds, and the giant water buffalo faltered
from its injured right foreleg.  
  
―Dadaan!!  
As if timing it perfectly, Jennifer fired a volley from her high-caliber
sniper rifle.  
The first bullet ricocheted off its skull, but the second bullet was
shot into the mouth of the giant water buffalo that raised its face from
the impact, and it spewed out a large amount of blood.  
But―  
  
***"Bruu..."***  
Whether the bullet didn't reach its brain, or because of the vitality of
the giant beast, the giant water buffalo and Jennifer were still glaring
at each other. The moment she moved her shoulder slightly, as if taking
that as a signal, the second spear team that had been sneaking up jumped
in all at once and pierced the giant beast's neck.  
  
―Thud.  
Finally, the giant water buffalo collapsed with its eyes rolled back.  
"Jennifer!"  
"I know!"  
Daaan!!  
Jennifer shouted at me when I called out to her, then fired a bullet
into the head of the buffalo. It had been pretending to be dead. The
water buffalo, which had been shaking its body violently, finally had
its life extinguished.  
  
It had high intelligence. More than that, it had a strong obsession.
That's why you can't let your guard down around giant beasts.  
But if they become allies, they're reassuring... right, Hachibei?  
***"Wafun!"***  
Hachibei, who had been preparing to jump out as soon as the children
were in danger, was wagging his tail happily.  
...He seems very happy. Hmm... Beef for dinner tonight.  
  
The first day passed like that, and on the second day, with the increase
in houses and buildings, the speed of progress slowed down to prepare
for attacks from the surroundings.  
The timing may have been a little bad. Summer was over, but tall weeds
had grown during that time, and the increase in fallen leaves in autumn
made it feel even more difficult to move around.  
"Arrival is expected to be around noon tomorrow."  
Jennifer told me that when she came back from a break-time meeting. It
seems like we’ll be able to arrive without any major problems, even
though we’re behind schedule.  
  
I thought that as we got closer to Tokyo, we'd only see buildings
swallowed up by the forest and that progress would slow down even more,
but that wasn't the case.  
The streets of Tokyo have roads that are higher than the forest, such as
elevated roads and expressways, and there were almost no fallen leaves,
so we're making more progress than I thought. But...  
"Jennifer?"  
Jennifer's face was a little stern, even though we're supposedly making
good progress. Some of the children had similar puzzled expressions, and
when I called out to her, she muttered in a small voice, as if spilling
out her anxiety.  
"...No giant beasts are attacking."  
  
Apparently, up until now, at least five or six giant beasts would’ve
attacked by the time they reached this area. In particular, if they were
found by the giant lion packs that claimed Tokyo as their territory,
they would’ve had to consider retreating depending on the number.  
The pack leader, a giant male lion, was especially dangerous. There were
other male lions that managed the area, but they weren’t as threatening.
But the pack leader was a size larger than the others, and had killed
many soldiers.  
Jennifer and the others were discussing that the pack leader may have
been involved in instigating the other giant beasts as they were
frightened during the previous attack on the shelter.  
A giant male lion... The giant gorilla leader was also a size larger
than the females and had the strength to command the other individuals.
If the giant male has the power to dominate this area, I'll have to be
the one to face it.  
But―  
"Tsubaki?"  
"No, it's nothing."  
What was the "thunder" that they said they heard during the shelter
attack...? It was like a thorn stuck deep in the back of my mind.  
  
The elevated road continued to near the giant radio tower, which was our
destination. After staying overnight on the way, we started moving early
in the morning and I felt a slight sense of unease.  
"It's dark..."  
It should be bright in the morning since it's still autumn, but it was
still dim outside no matter how much time passed.  
"It's true... There are clouds."  
Jennifer told me that she had checked outside from the back since there
were no windows. The children were discussing whether they should change
their equipment if it was going to rain, but my uneasiness didn't go
away.  
At that moment―  
  
Doooooooon!!  
Suddenly, a sound like thunder rang out, and the younger children let
out small screams.  
***"―Uuuuu"***  
I heard Hachibei's growl from outside, and with a foreboding heart, I
quickly jumped out of the truck and saw a huge radio tower so tall I had
to look up... and on the building in front of it, a giant carnivorous
beast clad in lightning devouring what appeared to be the corpse of a
giant male lion.
