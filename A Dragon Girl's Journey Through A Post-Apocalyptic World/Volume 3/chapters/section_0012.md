# 68 City Of People

Kanto Petrochemical Complex. The largest complex in Japan, boasting the
highest crude oil refining capacity.  
The surviving companies and the military decided to use this place as a
base for survival. While accepting some evacuees, they built an outer
wall and strived to maintain civilization.  
It was the largest evacuation site in Kanto, with a small town built
inside the outer walls. Crops were grown, electric lights were lit, and
people lived a life close to what they had before the mutations, albeit
minimally.  
  
But... the faces of the people living there were not exactly bright.  
Due to the rapid growth of mutated plants, enough wheat and vegetables
are harvested to feed tens of thousands of people. Although chickens are
the only common livestock, the meat of giant creatures could also be
processed and eaten.  
Shopping was possible in the town using the old Japanese yen, clothing
made of synthetic fibers was sold, and music was played.  
However, these were gradually dwindling finite resources.  
  
The variety of vegetables was limited and monotonous. Because going
offshore for fish invited attacks from giant creatures, only small fish
could be caught. There was plenty of salt, but soy sauce production
couldn't keep up, leaving only chemically synthesized products or fish
sauce. Rice, which requires a large amount of fresh water, could only be
eaten a few times a year at best. Everything was in short supply.  
New books weren't being made, and the number of e-books and movies that
could be viewed in data form was decreasing due to equipment
deterioration.  
Modern civilization is a consumer culture, and it cannot function unless
new things are constantly replenished.  
  
Items that cannot be produced in this area must be obtained from
somewhere else.  
However, the threat of giant creatures was more severe than expected.
Most of the units dispatched to secure the lacking supplies had been
wiped out, and the supplies obtained in exchange for their lives were
given to the upper echelons of companies and the military.  
People who had lived in an information society were isolated from
information, and their hearts were weakened by a future with no end in
sight.  
But, however...  
An existence that might be able to break through that situation came
flying in.  
  
"How is the condition of the subject?"  
"Not very good, sir."  
In a room in a hospital that existed before the mutations, something
resembling a girl with horns and reddish-brown skin was restrained on a
bed.  
Reports indicated that a high "heat" was felt even through the team
members' gloves when she was captured, but the subject's body
temperature had now decreased and was almost the same as the room
temperature. However, "not very good" did not mean she was dying.  
Even in that state, her heart rate and pulse were almost the same as
those of a typical young woman, her breathing was normal, and there was
nothing wrong with her except for her body temperature.  
However, when military doctors and corporate researchers tried to
examine the subject's body and draw blood, the needle would not pierce
her skin. Her skin, which looked ordinary at first glance, became as
hard as steel the moment a certain amount of pressure was applied. When
tools were used instead, the skin instantly became covered in bright red
scales if the pressure was increased further, resulting in the
destruction of valuable tools in exchange for obtaining only a tiny
fragment of a scale.  
It was presumed that the subject was in a state of hibernation or
near-hibernation by lowering her body temperature. She wouldn't die
immediately even in this state, but research wasn't progressing.  
  
An assault rifle at close range could damage the scales, but currently,
she could only be kept quiet by continuously using sleeping gas, and
causing that much harm could awaken her.  
She was currently in a state of hibernation due to forced sleep, but she
was a uniquely dangerous individual who required special forces and a
Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit to capture.  
  
"What about keeping her at a low temperature if she's like a reptile?"  
"I don't know if that will be effective. Besides, if she dies, it's all
for nothing, sir."  
A Japanese man who appeared to be a researcher shook his head at the
words of a man who seemed to be a high-ranking U.S. military officer.
This "subject" could become the hope of this base.  
A U.S. reconnaissance plane that came only once every few years. Knowing
from the information of other countries that there were still surviving
countries and people, the people here gained hope that human forces
could still recover.  
However, it has not appeared since then, and some have pessimistically
speculated that they may have been abandoned by the United States.  
Are the few surviving U.S. troops in Japan no longer comrades? Has
Japan, a friendly country, become unimportant? Is it because of the
burden of the many refugees who cannot fight and only consume
resources?  
  
People need hope to live. Especially for those who lived before the
mutations, the current situation is no different from despair. They need
hope to overcome despair.  
The information given by the reconnaissance plane. The existence of a
"dragon" in the depths of the Eurasian continent.  
If that existence is related to this global-scale mutation, it needs to
be investigated.  
With the military power in this country, it was difficult not only to
cooperate with the U.S. operations but even to go to the site. There
were doctors, but there were almost no biology experts, making them more
of a burden than a fighting force.  
However, the United States would be interested in this subject... a girl
with horns, a tail, and strong scales, possessing the characteristics of
a "dragon." If that happened, this base would be able to take on a
globally important position when humanity launches an offensive led by
the United States.  
But before that, it was necessary to carry out the operation that had
been planned for some time, in parallel with researching the subject.  
Most of the communications satellites were no longer accessible, but if
the United States still existed, there should still be satellites in
operation. To communicate with them, it was necessary to seize the
equipment needed for communication from Japan's largest radio tower in
Tokyo.  
  
Humans need hope, and they have obtained a "hope" that could overturn
their situation.  
But if... the reason why the U.S. military reconnaissance plane didn't
come was not that they abandoned them... The "despair" that the United
States had already collapsed was something that everyone thought about
in the back of their minds but could not bring themselves to say.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
"Here, you have to take care of your wounds properly."  
"Yes."  
The Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit. Despite its importance, the
children isolated in the building used as a military facility gathered
together and healed their wounds.  
Jennifer, as the only surviving elder, was taking care of the younger
children.  
Recently, she has not shown much emotion. She re-wrapped the bandage on
the arm of an eight-year-old boy who was squatting down, leaving his
wound unattended.  
  
This boy was one of the children who accompanied the last capture, and
he was injured when a bullet grazed him.  
"Here... take this 'medicine'."  
"But that's Jennifer's..."  
"I'm still okay."  
Jennifer was hit by friendly fire in the previous battle. Her synthetic
fiber armor prevented a fatal wound, but Jennifer smiled with slight
dark circles under her eyes at the worried boy.  
  
Jennifer and the other new children with unusual powers not only have
high physical abilities but also strong fighting instincts, survival
skills, and natural healing abilities.  
At the beginning of their training, they were treated when they were
injured, but because even a fracture would heal in about ten days, they
gradually stopped receiving proper treatment. Unless the injury was very
serious, they could only do self-treatment with disinfection and
bandages.  
  
Even if their injuries heal quickly, they still feel pain. Because they
can move even when they are in pain due to their high physical
abilities, even the injured ones were forced to do normal training from
the next day, and no day went by without pain.  
The "medicine" provided to Jennifer and the others was what relieved
that "pain."  
Jennifer gave the "medicine" to the small child who was groaning in pain
from training and endured it herself, but she could not sleep at night
because of the pain and was losing energy.  
  
There were just over fifty children, including the infants isolated in
the welfare facility.  
At first, there were more than a hundred, and even though nearly ten
children were sent every year, the number of children, who were used
almost as expendable pawns, was decreasing.  
(I have to protect these children...)  
Protecting the younger children all by herself. But, that effort was in
vain. Jennifer's heart was on the verge of breaking as her comrades died
in battle with giant beasts one after another.  
She was currently maintaining her composure out of a sense of
responsibility, but she didn’t know what would happen if any more of her
comrades died.  
But...  
  
"...That girl."  
When she noticed the "antler spear" that she had somehow brought back,
her heart softened a little.  
Jennifer's heart was shaken by her eyes and words, which were the first
to show concern for her since her parents were killed by giant beasts
when she was a child. When she hugged the spear, it seemed to ease the
pain a little, and she felt like she could sleep a little now.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
***“Wafun!”***  
―Thud.  
A giant deer, over five meters tall, collapsed with a ground-shaking
sound. Hachibei, who had grown from a puppy to a small dog in just a few
days, stood on top of it and barked.  
Hachibei regretted having to leave Hanatsubaki, but he acted without
hesitation. He couldn't help Hanatsubaki because he was still young. So,
to gain power quickly, he chose to defeat giant animals as a "source of
nourishment," and grow, like Hanatsubaki.  
  
Hachibei greedily devoured the giant deer, which was larger than
himself. He wrapped only the heart in a curtain he had skillfully taken
from someone's house as a souvenir for Hanatsubaki, held it in his
mouth, and started running.  
To the human base where Hanatsubaki was captured.  
***“Wafun!”***
