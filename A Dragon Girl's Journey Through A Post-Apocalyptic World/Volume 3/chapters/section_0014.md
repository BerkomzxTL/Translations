# 70 Awakening

In the dark room, Hanatsubaki's entire body was covered in crimson
scales. Unlike before, when only her limbs and back, which strongly
retained the form of a human, were covered, even her abdomen and face
were now covered in scales.  
  
As the "Dragon" factor intensified, the toxins within her body were
broken down by the internal "heat," and her consciousness quietly
awakened. Simultaneously, the temperature of the hospital room isolating
Hanatsubaki began to rise.  
  
The room temperature, already exceeding thirty degrees Celsius due to
the summer, continued to climb to fifty... seventy, causing water to
gush from the barely functioning sprinklers, creating massive amounts of
steam due to the high heat.  
  
Alarms blared throughout the hospital, and researchers who had left
their posts to gather research materials for evacuation rushed back.  
"What's happening?!"  
"I, I don't know!"  
Beyond the large glass window in the anteroom leading to the isolation
room, everything was obscured by a large amount of steam and water
droplets, making it impossible to see inside. More than that, the heat,
even detectable through the glass, bewildered the researchers.  
  
"...Did a giant beast attack cause the sprinklers to malfunction?"  
One of the researchers muttered, but that didn't explain the abnormal
heat. As an older researcher considered whether an electrical short had
caused a fire, a younger researcher turned back with a pale face.  
"More importantly, if the subject dies because of this heat..."  
The operation was based on the premise of securing this subject with the
characteristics of a "Dragon." The young researcher panicked, realizing
it would be their responsibility if the subject died. The older
researcher frowned, realizing they needed manpower.  
"Immediately call for protective suits and backup—"  
  
—Crackle—  
  
At that moment, they heard a creaking sound from beyond the glass
window, and they fell quiet. The sound reminded them of a description of
the subject's characteristics in the report from the military—the
description of emitting so much "heat" that gloves would ignite.  
"This is bad..."  
If the "heat" originated from the subject, the subject probably wouldn't
die. But they realized the possibility that the sleeping gas, which was
periodically dispersed in the room by the sprinklers, had been
neutralized.  
"Call the soldiers, now!!"  
  
—Snap—  
  
The sound of metal fittings breaking. The older researcher, realizing
that the awakened subject had broken free of the restraints, took out a
handgun from the provided locker.  
"Chief!"  
"If this one gets out now, with giant beasts attacking, we won't be able
to control it!"  
They couldn't let this subject die. Even if it wasn't human, the older
researcher thought it might obey if a gun was pointed at it, and he
tossed a spare gun to the younger researcher.  
"Prepare immediately—"  
  
WHOOOSSSHHHH!!  
Red flames erupted beyond the glass window, causing cracks to spread
across the large, fire-resistant glass.  
Crash!!  
"Uwaaah!?"  
The glass shattered, and the two researchers tumbled into the hallway as
flames and steam poured out.  
"It's hot, it's hot!"  
While the steam-burned researcher rolled around in pain, the older
researcher, also burned, raised the gun with reddened hands.  
BOOOOM!!  
At that moment, the iron door of the isolation room was blown off and
impaled into the wall next to the researcher.  
  
An eerie "shadow" was visible through the steam. The older researcher,
forgetting even the pain of the burns, understood that it was the
subject and hastily aimed the gun.  
"...St, stop!"  
The older researcher managed to call out. But from the moving "shadow,"
a golden light glared at him, and he inadvertently pulled the trigger.  
Bang!  
The bullet, fired at point-blank range, luckily hit the subject. But the
bullet was deflected by something hard, and as if triggered by that, a
strange sound began to echo.  
  
***"――――――――――――――――――――――"***  
  
A "voice" that humans could not produce grew in volume, and at that
moment, the roar was released as a massive flash of light.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
"Don't falter!! Rifle squad, deploy!!"  
The special forces captain shouted while retreating from the swarm of
giant beasts pouring in through the destroyed wall. One of the two
machine guns had been crushed along with its armored vehicle by a giant
crocodile, but the other was still operational. Special forces members
deployed to fill the gap, and began sniping with anti-physical rifles.  
(Damn it! To think this many would come at once!)  
The captain thought to himself as he gave instructions.  
If there were only about ten, they could have defeated the giant beasts
without relying on the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit. Even if the
entire giant lion pack based in Tokyo had attacked, they could have
driven them away with machine guns, even if civilians were harmed.  
(We should have focused more on exterminating giant beasts, without
thinking about those brats…)  
  
The captain had wanted to demonstrate his power, but he inadvertently
revealed his true feelings due to the crisis, which was the first in
several years.  
New humans, different from them, the old humans, adapted to the current
world. Archaeologists had told them that the old humans would be driven
out by the new humans in just a few centuries.  
That "fear of the future" caused them to excessive mistreat the children
of the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit, and lessened the guilt of using
them up by thinking of them as a different species from themselves.  
It is not the old humans who should perish.  
That was the latent thought held by the upper management controlling
this base, making them unnecessarily stubborn and unwilling to consider
coexistence with the new humans.  
"Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit, get to the front line and hold back
the giant beasts! That's your reason for existence!"  
  
\*\*\*  
  
"...Everyone, let's move forward!"  
Jennifer, who had been dealing with the swarm of beasts away from the
special forces, made the agonizing decision for the younger children in
response to the captain's order.  
Among the children who still retained their sanity and showed
expressions of despair, the children whose emotions had become thin and
worn out blindly followed instructions.  
She knew that sending such children to the front would result in
casualties. The children, who had not been taught the skills necessary
for survival, feared losing their "place" at this base.  
Jennifer suppressed her fear to secure their place as well, gripping the
sniper rifle she had retrieved and the "antler spear" she had brought as
a good luck charm.  
"Follow me!"  
  
Jennifer had no choice but to move forward in order to save as many as
possible.  
As she charged in with terrifying speed, holding the retrieved sniper
rifle, a giant hyena attacked her, but Jennifer pulled the trigger of
the rifle she had shoved into its mouth along with her arm before it
could bite off her shoulder.  
BOOOOM!!  
The recoil sent them both flying, and just as the giant hyena, not
immediately killed, tried to attack Jennifer with hateful eyes, several
other children slashed the giant hyena's neck with spears.  
"Jennifer!"  
"I'm okay... let's go!"  
Jennifer forced a smile so that they wouldn't see her pain to the
children who rushed over.  
The "antler spear" strapped to her back had momentarily prevented the
giant beast's fangs from biting into her. Jennifer recalled the face of
"that person" who was the only one who worried about them, and again
readied the sniper rifle.  
  
She wouldn't let any more comrades die. Even if it was so painful that
she wanted to erase her emotions, the children's hearts were not yet
dead. If there was hope, their hearts would surely return.  
To that end, Jennifer gritted her teeth and charged into the swarm of
giant beasts at the head of the group.  
  
"Hold them back! Don't let them get to their families!"  
Volunteer soldiers from the refugees fired their guns from atop the
gate. If they didn't hold them back here, their families would be
attacked.  
But their numbers were dwindling, and only a few squads remained when
Jennifer and the others arrived.  
"Where are the special forces!?"  
The special forces, who were supposed to be holding them back together,
were nowhere to be seen. As Jennifer scanned the area while fighting the
giant beasts, she noticed that they had retreated, and were even using
the general soldiers and the Giant Beast Countermeasures Unit as bait,
and were trying to fire mortars set up on the ground.  
Don, don, don!  
  
"Everyone, scatter!!"  
Jennifer's throat-shattering scream was drowned out, and mortar shells
fell on Jennifer and the others as if to incinerate them along with the
swarm of giant beasts.  
Jennifer reached out to a general soldier who was also stunned, but a
shell fell near the soldier, blowing him away from the back.  
"...Why."  
Jennifer, covered in the blood and gore, muttered in astonishment, and
one of the boys picked her up and ran.  
"Hold on!"  
"W, what am I..."  
What were they fighting for? Were they not even allowed to seek a
glimmer of hope?  
***"GAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
"Uwaaah!"  
One of the giant lionesses, having clawed its way through the shelling,
blew them both away as if venting its anger on something, even though it
was covered in blood.  
"Kuh!"  
The boy who had fallen was bleeding from the head and unmoving. The
giant lioness raised her claws at Jennifer, who was shielding the boy.  
"Someone—"  
  
—Help me—  
  
A cry from the soul— At that moment, a beam of light shot through one of
the distant hospital buildings, incinerated several giant beasts as if
wielding a giant spear, and pierced the skull of the giant lioness
attacking Jennifer.  
"What is..."  
Not "what." "Something" strong was coming from that direction.  
Erupting flames. It shook the atmosphere like a heat haze and bisected
the torso of a giant crocodile in its path while raising a burst of
flames, and incinerated it in an instant.  
Amidst the evaporating crimson steam, "it" blew away the bloody haze
with "wings" spewing flames, revealing its form.  
  
Crimson scales covering its entire body. Four red crystal horns on its
head. And its back, with a tail thick and as tall as a person. It formed
into a four-legged, forward-leaning posture, with large, scaly wings
sparkling as they spewed flames.  
That figure was truly like that of a legendary—  
"—Dragon—"  
  
At that moment, "man" witnessed a human-shaped "Dragon"
