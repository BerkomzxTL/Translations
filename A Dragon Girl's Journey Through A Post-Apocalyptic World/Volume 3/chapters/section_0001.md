# 57 South…

**Volume 3: The World Of The Future**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Hachibei-chan, I think I want to fly."  
***"Wafun?"***  
Hachibei tilted his head at my words.  
  
Leaving Jinbei and his family's home, I resumed my journey with a new
companion, a big Shiba Inu puppy named Hachibei.  
Hachibei is full of energy, but since he's still a puppy, his legs are
short and he's slow. He looks like a big puppy, almost the same size as
a life-sized bear plushie. Isn't he basically a bear at this point? But
he has a strong teddy bear vibe.  
It’d be fine to just keep running through city areas and grasslands, but
unfortunately Jinbei's house is in the mountains, so we had to cross a
mountain to get back to where I was.  
That's why...  
  
"Let's fly!"  
***"Wafun!?"***  
I jumped onto Hachibei's back, who’s bigger than a human, gathered the
"heat" of my body on my back, and spread bright red, scaled wings from
around my shoulder blades with a crackling sound.  
"Here we go!"  
***"Wau wau wau!!"***  
"Heat" gushed out like a jet from the scales of my wings, which were
larger than my height when fully spread. As we began to float from the
ground, Hachibei whined as if pleading.  
"It's okay."  
I also have experience flying while carrying a lot of meat, so I'm used
to a certain amount of weight.  
At that time, I couldn't fly very fast because it was too heavy, but now
that my stamina has recovered, I'm sure it'll be okay!  
  
Doooon!!  
  
***"Kyan!?"***  
At that moment, we shot off like a cannonball, leaving behind a contrail
and a roar that shook the air.  
"Whoa, wai―"  
***"Kyan!!"***  
Perhaps I had underestimated the weight, but the speed far exceeded my
expectations. Not only that, but Hachibei was frightened and started
thrashing around, causing him to lose his balance. After flinging over
the mountain in an instance, we lost speed, and then glided and plunged
like skipping stones into a river somewhere.  
Zappaaaaaan!!  
  
And...  
"No, I'm sorry."  
***"Wafun..."***  
After getting out of the river, we were both soaking wet, and I
apologized profusely. Hachibei licked his burnt tail while barking at
me.  
Hachibei wasn’t thrashing because he was afraid of flying, but rather it
seems it’s because the "heat" gushing out from my wings was burning his
tail.  
Hachibei is classified as a giant animal, so although his fur was burnt,
he wasn't burned, so it's just barely safe. This time, it was probably
because I couldn't cover Hachibei's size with my body size.  
It’d be dangerous if I flew while carrying humans or something with
this. I'm glad I noticed. ...But even before that, I feel like they
might be crushed by the pressure of the launch...  
  
"...Okay, let's eat! Okay?"  
I suggested food to cheer him up. Several hours have passed since we
last ate, and while my fuel efficiency is good when I'm not fighting,
Hachibei is growing, so the moment he heard *food*, he raised his head
and wagged his tail.  
***"Wafun!"***  
...Is it okay for him to be so easily won over? I understand a little
why his mother gave him to me. No, before that, why does he understand
human language? There weren't people around who talked, right? Did he
learn it in the few days he spent with me? Isn't that amazing?  
  
"Even so, what should we eat..."  
This is probably the river where I was attacked by the giant crocodile
in terms of distance and direction, but it's not a landscape I've seen
before. I'm thinking that if I walk, there might be a town...  
***"Wafun."***  
Hachibei, wagging his tail, shook off the water droplets, and then
jumped into the river.  
...What was the point of shaking off the water? Hachibei started playing
in the river, splashing around, and when he started dog-paddling to a
deep spot, he suddenly jumped a few meters. When he looked up, he was
holding a big fish.  
"Ohhh~"  
As expected, wild puppies are strong. When I couldn't help but clap,
Hachibei puffed out his chest proudly.  
"...Eh?"  
  
At that moment, the surface of the river behind Hachibei swelled
greatly.  
Zappaaaaaaan!!  
"Hachibei!"  
What appeared was a huge jaw. Just as it was about to bare its fangs at
Hachibei, I readied my antler spear and shot out like an arrow using my
legs and tail.  
  
Dogoon!  
***"Kyan!?"***  
***"――――――――――――!!"***  
The moment before it bit, my kick landed on the giant jaw, and the
screams of Hachibei and the (presumed) giant animal echoed.  
Even if I say it’s giant, it's only giant compared to normal animals.
It's not as big as the giant crocodile. The giant animal that I kicked
changed direction as if bouncing off the surface of the river and
attacked me, who had hurt it.  
This is...  
"Arapaima!?"  
  
I'm pretty sure it's a huge fish from around South America, right!?
Again, is it from some aquarium or zoo!?  
"............"  
I avoided the attack without panicking and observed it. I know I'm being
carefree, but I have enough leeway to observe.  
Because, isn't this strange? Arapaima, if they're big, grow up to about
four meters, right? If they're that big, I understand them growing
giant, but this arapaima only looks to be a dozen or so meters long.  
If the original size is a few meters, it wouldn't be strange if it was
dozens of meters when it became giant, right? Could it still be young?
While observing it cautiously, I sensed something as I watched it
swimming uncomfortably in the wide river.  
"...They can't swim when they get big..."  
  
Even if the river is big, it doesn't have a depth of dozens of meters
like a lake. The arapaima here isn't young, and I realized with a
feeling of relief that if it became dozens of meters as an adult, it
would become unable to move and starve to death.  
"...Eii."  
***"――――――――!"***  
I stabbed my red-hot antler spear into the head of the giant arapaima
floundering near the shallows to finish it off. ...I feel like this was
the easiest one so far. Even so, I think it would have taken time if I
hadn't become able to use "heat" freely.  
"Hachibei is...?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
When I looked for the puppy that had disappeared without me noticing,
Hachibei had already come out of the river and was sitting well-behaved
and wagging his tail as if waiting to be fed.  
  
After killing the giant arapaima, I dragged it to the shore and cut off
several kilograms of fillets with my antler spear and tusk knife while
dismantling it. Then Hachibei, who had been waiting, devoured them one
after another.  
"You eat a lot."  
***"Wafun!"***  
Hachibei wagged his tail with (probably) a smile at my half-exasperated
mutter.  
He must have already eaten over a hundred kilograms, but it seems like
he can still eat. Can he store food like I can? If not, it's going to be
difficult to feed him from now on.  
If this were normal, Jinbei's fields would probably have been eaten up
by the puppies by now, so I want to believe that he’s able to stockpile
food.  
...And is it just my imagination, or does Hachibei seem to be getting
slightly bigger?  
  
I think Hachibei and I ate about 30% of it. I want to take about 100
kilograms, but I don't have a leather bag.  
My current belongings consist of just my leather clothes, antler spear,
and tusk knife. I left everything, including Granny's seed rice, with
the children, but I should’ve retrieved at least the bag without trying
to look cool...  
I thought I wouldn't be able to part with the children unless it was at
that moment.  
"It can't be helped..."  
I don't have the hobby of making bags out of arapaima skin after all.
It'd smell fishy.  
I cut off about two meters of the giant arapaima's tail, and with an
"Alright!" I hoisted it onto my shoulder.  
  
"Let's go then, Hachibei. First, let's recover the supplies!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
  
Hachibei and I nodded to each other and started running along the
riverside road.  
To the south... to the place where the shelter was said to be.  
In search of the reason why this world became like this, and the meaning
of my birth.
