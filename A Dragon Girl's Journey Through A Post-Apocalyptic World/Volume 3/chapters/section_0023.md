# 79 The Future To Come

"Don't let them near the technicians!!"  
The commander of the special forces raised his voice as the attacking
giant beasts approached.  
The enemies they were facing were five giant lionesses and three giant
hyenas. Honestly, the numbers were beyond what this unit could handle,
but their morale was higher than that of the giant beasts who were being
controlled and forced to fight.  
"Yes, sir!"  
Jennifer replied with vigor, dodging claws with her high physical
ability and blasting a giant hyena with rifle bullets at close range.  
The hyena's head snapped back from the impact, and soldiers cheered as
Hachibei and the children with spears jumped in to finish it off,
gaining hope.  
  
(...How convenient.)  
The captain muttered to himself in his mind.  
The previous person in charge hated the giant beasts that killed his
family, and the transformed world that created them. He wasn't the only
one, the radicals in the upper echelons felt the same way.  
The captain understood their feelings, as he too had lost friends and
subordinates. But they directed that hatred towards the young children
who had gained abnormal powers.  
He understood some of it, but if he opposed it because he didn't like
it, he would lose his place. This world was no longer a place where you
could easily leave the community like before.  
  
It was then that the girl with the dragon-like physical characteristics
appeared.  
Many people still felt aversion to her existence. Some feared her
abnormal combat power.  
But her figure, defeating giant beasts with overwhelming power, blew a
gust of wind into the shelter life, which seemed to be just a slow march
to extinction in fear, and gave people a glimmer of hope.  
  
Those who felt it the most were probably the children who were still
fighting on the front lines.  
Despite all that they had been through, they went out to the front lines
to protect the humans.  
That dragon girl not only protected the children, but also gave them a
"future."  
The previous person in charge didn't give the children knowledge and
made them fight as if to use them up, probably because he thought that
when they grew up, they would become a threat to the old humans.  
But that was not the case. These children were the hope that humans
could still live in this world.  
It would still take time for the upper echelons and some of the radicals
to understand that. Until then...he considered it his atonement for not
being able to protect the children in the past, to protect them until
they become adults.  
  
It all started with the coming of the dragon girl.  
Some of the U.S. soldiers still couldn't accept her. Even so, the reason
why the shelter community accepted her was because she was a
cute-looking girl, but the captain smiled wryly, thinking that's just
how the Japanese are.  
"Alright, let's go! Let's show them the power of humans!"  
  
―At the moment the captain shouted that.  
A huge thunderclap roared from over the elevated highway.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
***"GaaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaa!!"***  
From the bridge over the river, the Raijū fired off a huge bolt of
lightning.  
As the spherical lightning strike seemed to fill the wide river, I tried
to leave, but―  
"―!?"  
Electricity was discharged from the lightning ball, turning the
surroundings into plasma, and the electric shock entangled me as I tried
to fly away.  
What happened!? The electricity discharged into the atmosphere was
affecting me too. But I shouldn't be taking damage by something like
this...could it be!?  
  
ZapppaaaaaAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAaaan!!  
"Tch!"  
A large number of objects jumped out of the river in succession and
entangled me.  
That guy! He's crazy! He created a magnetic field using electricity!?
That's impossible!?  
Metal objects such as bicycles and hangers that had fallen into the
river became the core and entangled me, depriving me of my freedom.  
I faced the approaching giant lightning ball―  
"―...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!"  
I immediately raised my voice and fired the "Dragon's Breath" at the
lightning ball and the Raijū beyond it.  
  
BaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
The giant lightning ball and "Dragon's Breath" collided, and the impact
shattered the glass of the buildings that remained along the river. The
branches and leaves of the overgrown giant trees were blown away, and
the burning leaves collided with the water that attacked a moment later,
scattering water vapor.  
"Kuh..."  
I knelt on the exposed riverbed, which had been instantly evaporated and
blown away.  
I didn't expect him to try to burn me to death. Even so, he couldn't
kill me, a dragon, and the new armor was hot, but not yet broken.  
―Juuwaaaaaa.....  
After a few seconds, the blown away water began to return, touching my
heated body and turning into steam. Seeing the water beginning to
collect at my feet, I soared into the sky before being submerged.  
The Raijū―  
  
"―!"  
***"Gaooooooooooooooooooo!!"***  
As if waiting for me to rise from the water, the Raijū, running along
the side of the overpass, attacked.  
Bakiin!!  
The lightning-charged claws and the glowing hot antler spear collided,
repelling each other.  
I used my wings to fly over the river and landed on a low building, and
the Raijū, thinking I would chase it, frowned and fired lightning from
across the river.  
"Haaaaaa!!"  
I also pointed the tips of my wings at the Raijū and fired fireballs to
intercept the lightning.  
"............"  
***"............"***  
The Raijū and I glared at each other across the river.  
As expected, it's strong... But why isn't it pursuing? I'm starting to
feel hungry from using too much "heat," but maybe the Raijū is exhausted
too.  
  
The Raijū started moving to the left, and I followed it.  
The first bridge was cut in two by my flash, but the Raijū headed to the
opposite bridge, and as we began to cross at the same time, we collided
in the center of the bridge.  
Gan!  
The Raijū's claws and my antler spear collided, scattering sparks. I
braced myself with my claws and tail to avoid being bounced back by the
difference in physique, and pushed back with the power of my
flame-spewing wings.  
Gan! Gon!  
I made up for the size difference with flames, and we exchanged blows on
the bridge.  
  
***"Gaaaa!!"***  
The Raijū, frustrated by not being able to break through, swung down its
lightning-covered horn.  
I also gripped the spear with both arms filled with "heat," and slammed
it down with all my might while spewing flames.  
Baan!!  
"Tsu!"  
The burst of lightning struck me, and a powerful light flashed in the
depths of my eyes.  
  
―What is this...?  
I can see an unfamiliar scene. Electrical signals? Is this the Raijū's
memory?  
A herd of giant tigers. The Raijū exhibiting abnormal power――  
Killing the giant tigers who were attacking despite being family―  
A slight sense of loneliness. Even so, the Raijū chose to be alone―  
The Raijū sought power. Ah, I see...  
  
The Raijū believed that eventually, this world will be filled with
mutations like itself.  
Even if there are differences in the amount of power, there will come a
time when they will rule this world.  
For that time, the Raijū sought power and craved battles with powerful
enemies.  
But...humans are also changing.  
Children with power... Small changes such as elongated canines and
pointed ears were beginning to occur in young children like Riku and
Sora.  
But if that's the case, then this world is―  
The moment I was about to reach a conclusion...  
In the darkened world, a black-haired girl wearing a black sailor
uniform smiled mischievously, holding one finger in front of her lips.  
  
―Bachiin!!  
When my vision returned, our powers burst apart, the center of the
cracked bridge collapsed, and the Raijū and I were thrown into the air
in an instant.  
***"Guooooooooooooooooooooooo!!"***  
The Raijū hurriedly tried to return to the bridge. I knew it... Even if
it has a way to decompose water, it doesn't want to fight by the river
with a lot of water.  
Even so, the reason it didn't change the location was because of its
pride as a strong person...but.  
"I won't let you escape!"  
***"Gaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
I grabbed the Raijū's horn and flew straight down using the force of my
wings.  
DoboooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!  
***"Gaoooooooooooooooooo!"***  
I jumped into the river, and the electric shock spread across the
surface of the water. My hands were burned by the horns of the Raijū as
it emitted electricity, but I didn't let go and pulled him further to
the bottom of the water.  
  
***"Guoooooooooooooooo!!!!"***  
Realizing my intentions, the Raijū emitted a massive electric shock, not
caring that it would be diffused. Is it planning to decompose all this
water!?  
The river fish were burned by the electric shock and jumped up over a
wide area, and the decomposed water disappeared, causing the center of
the river to unnaturally cave in.  
The Beast tried to shake off the electricity that was no longer being
diffused within it, but seeing what I was about to do, it panicked and
tried to get away.  
But it's too late―  
"I can withstand 'heat,' but how about you?"  
  
I spewed a large amount of flames from my mouth. What’s here now?  
The place was filled with a large amount of hydrogen and oxygen, which
then reacted to the flames to create a massive explosion.
