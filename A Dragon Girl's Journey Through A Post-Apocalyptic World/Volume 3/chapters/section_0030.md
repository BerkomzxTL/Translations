# 86 Respective Reasons

"A different world… ‘Dragon’…"  
I muttered in astonishment at the words of the black dragon Waleum
before my eyes.  
Another world...? Another world!? Assuming such a world exists, why
would a dragon from that world appear in this world? Could it be
that...  
"This world changing is..."  
...because of this black dragon? As if reading my mind filled with such
doubts, Waleum nodded quietly.  
  
***"Indeed.*** ***By my arrival**, this world has undergone
transformation."***  
  
This dragon? This one dragon coming here caused the world to become like
this? And the reason is to fight me!?  
The black dragon narrowed his eyes in pity at my confusion, and quietly
shifted his gaze.  
  
***"If you desire knowledge about this world, you should ask the person
involved. The 'accomplice' in this matter."***  
  
"...Eh?"  
The person at the end of that gaze—Tamachii—gave me, who was
dumbfounded, a troubled-looking... yet completely innocent smile.  
"Tamachii...? What does this mean?"  
"Aha~, I guess I gotta explain, huh... well, there's no helping it."  
As I glared at her with half-closed eyes, Tamachii sat down on a folding
chair she took out from somewhere, and began to speak as if telling a
fairy tale to a small child.  
"This dragon's world, Mundus, is on the verge of destruction—"  
  
The other world, Mundus—a world with only day and night. Light and
darkness.  
Day and night switch every half day, there is no rotation, no dusk or
dawn, and when half of the world is covered in light, the other half is
shrouded in darkness.  
Where there is light, fire burns, and where there is darkness, water
springs forth.  
Before long, plants grew in that world, animals were born, and
intelligent beings that could be called humans created civilizations and
lived in peace.  
But that peace was gradually being lost...  
  
Little by little, just a little, half a step a day, the "night" began to
devour the "day."  
Mundus, after hundreds of millions of years, suddenly "transformed."  
The world was gradually... but surely changing. The fire that burned in
the light of day gradually waned, and the water that sprang up at night
overflowed.  
Intelligent beings began to seek out the cause and struggled to stop
it.  
But step by step, the night continued to spread, the overflowing water
covered the land, and the world, having lost its fire, froze over.  
Then, several years later... as life after life died out and perished,
the "world (Mundus)" gave birth to a new "dragon."  
  
***"That is the 'Dragon of Darkness', me."***  
  
What was the cause of the world's destruction?  
As the number of intelligent creatures increased and they began to
consume the world as if it were their own, the creatures forgot their
gratitude to the world, and "darkness" was born in their hearts.  
That "darkness" finally exceeded the world's correction limit and bared
its fangs at the world's creatures.  
  
"But you know, 'the world' was aware of it, too. But..."  
  
"The world" did nothing even though it was aware of the cause.  
Until the darkness filled the world and the life consuming the world
decreased...  
And after confirming that life had decreased by a certain amount, "the
world" sent the excess "night" to another world.  
With the "dragon" it had created as a guide.  
  
"...What is that 'night'?"  
Why did just that coming here cause this world to become like this?  
What is the true nature of that "night"?  
"It was just good timing. This world was also getting super crowded, and
heading towards destruction."  
  
The otherworld Mundus was on the verge of destruction due to an
overabundance of “night.” And in this world, the planet's balance had
collapsed because environmental pollution became severe and humans
stopped respecting nature, and because ‘that’ became insufficient, this
world was also heading down the path of ruin.  
However, no matter how powerful the "dragon" sent from another world
was, it’s not easy to cross from world to world. However, the Earth,
which was being exposed to gradual destruction due to the lack of
‘that’, summoned the "dragon" itself to accept Mundus' excessive
"night."  
  
"To obtain what it needed. And... to reduce the excess of 'humans'."  
"Yep."  
Tamachii smiled at my answer.  
As long as the number of people in this world continues to increase, the
world will continue down the path of destruction. But perhaps humans
could have realized this and avoided this fate.  
But this world chose to exterminate humanity rather than awaken it.  
The true nature of that power is—  
"The daytime light of Mundus is the power of the 'sun.' And the darkness
of night is—"  
  
—"Magical energy"—  
  
Magical energy, mana, supernatural power. Spirits create these things
from nature. If the world were a single life form, magical energy would
be the "blood," something necessary for the world.  
In the other world, Mundus, magical energy probablyserved as a
substitute for night.  
And on Earth, as "magical energy" filled the world, living things began
to "demonize," driving out humans, and monsters like Raijūs and yeti
began to be born.  
Individuals who could adapt to magical energy and use it as "power" were
born from humans. Eventually all humans would transform into "new
humans" adapted to magical energy.  
Not only physical abilities, but also the physical transformations of
young children like Riku and Sora are probably because of that.  
"And that's how Hanatsubaki-chan was born."  
"I am..."  
  
The "dragon" is what manages magical energy.  
"Dragons" had disappeared from Earth, where it had long been depleted,
but as magical energy was sent from Mundus, Earth gave birth to a
"dragon" again.  
"Y'know, you should've awakened sooner, but the appearance of the dragon
egg activated a volcano, and the human investigation team retrieved it,
so it took a long ten years for you to awaken."  
  
In Mundus, where magical energy served as a substitute for night, the
Dragon of Darkness was born, and on Earth, where spiritual power other
than fire had declined, the "Fire Dragon" was born.  
But...  
"There was a tiny problem. But it's not my fault, okay?"  
  
Tamachii explained that the problem was that the amount of magical
energy sent from Mundus was too much for the Earth's capacity.  
As Earth expected, over ninety percent of humanity died out, and they're
on the verge of extinction.  
But variant species, legitimate "monsters" like Raijūs, were being born
sooner than expected.  
Originally, if I, a Fire Dragon, had absorbed the "heat" of the volcano
and been born in a few years, I should have been able to manage it to
some extent, but humans interfered with that, and because there was more
magical energy than expected, Earth was now facing destruction again
sooner than the new humans could grow.  
  
"Mundus planned to sneak in more magical energy than we expected from
the beginning."  
From the beginning, the "dragon" from Mundus and the "dragon" of Earth
were destined to fight.  
It was trying to push me aside, take the seat of the "dragon" in this
world, and turn this Earth into a garbage dump.  
But—  
  
"I'd be cool with that though. Because this is a world that was once on
the verge of destruction. So, I only gave Hanatsubaki-chan the minimum
amount of 'knowledge' and wanted you to see this world for yourself, and
as the representative of this world, choose the future of this
planet."  
Tamachii, smiling kindly and saying that she would let me choose, looked
like a mother watching over her child.  
"...Tamachii, what are you?"  
When I asked her that again, Tamachii, having finished her rough
explanation, softly whispered with a smile still on her face.  
  
"I am 'Earth'.... The 'will' of this planet."
