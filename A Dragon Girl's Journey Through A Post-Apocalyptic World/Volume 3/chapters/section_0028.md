# 84 The Girl In The Sailor Uniform

"Damn, totally a perfect day for a drive!"  
"...Yeah, it is."  
***"Kyuun..."***  
The excessively long bridge that spans from prefecture to prefecture
hasn't been maintained for over ten years, but it poses no problem for a
single kei truck to pass. I thought there might be abandoned cars along
the way, but it seems the government stopped traffic to watch out for
giant sea creatures, and only a decayed barricade was left at the
entrance.  
It's really amazing it's still intact. There's some rust due to being
over the sea, but it only creaks a little. The weather is indeed perfect
for a drive, but Hachibei and I could only be perplexed by the carefree
voice coming from the kei truck's passenger seat.  
...Seriously, what is this!?  
  
A black-haired girl in a sailor uniform was hitchhiking at the entrance
of the bridge...  
About my height, not tall, and around the same age, mid-teens. Her
glossy black hair is cut neatly at shoulder length, and she's
incredibly cute... But she has a strange way of speaking.  
As I was still trying to process what was going on, that girl ran up to
the kei truck I had stopped with a smile, got into the passenger seat,
and somehow, we ended up giving her a ride.  
  
"Looky, Hachibei-chan, fish sausage~!"  
***"Wafun!?"***  
Hachibei, who had a pink object tossed at him from the passenger window,
was confused but jumped at it nonetheless and started munching away. As
I stared in amazement, the girl noticed and grinned.  
"Ah, the expiration date's all good!"  
"...Where did you get that?"  
"Bought it at the supermarket near my place."  
"Which one!?"  
Are they still manufacturing them somewhere!? And there's a store that
sells them? I asked the obvious, but she tilted her head, looking
unsure.  
"Near my place?"  
"I see..."  
  
Her black sailor uniform and shiny black loafers looked brand new, like
they were just taken out of the box. She's been feeding Hachibei fish
sausages that she pulls out of nowhere. If I ask, I doubt she'll answer,
and I feel like I'd lose if I pressed the issue.  
"Ah, Hanatsubaki-chan, wanna coffee gum?"  
"No, thank you..."  
I didn't even tell her my or Hachibei's names!?  
  
"So, what should I call you?"  
Hearing her call my name, I remembered I hadn't asked for hers, so I
asked, and she told me easily.  
"Tamachii’s good."  
"Tamachii... Okay."  
It's probably a nickname, but what if it's her real name? ...Well,
whatever.  
"So? Where do you want to go, Tamachii?"  
My response will depend on that. It's one thing if she's getting off
somewhere along the way, but I'm sure that's not the case.  
"Mnnnnnn... For now, Mount Fuji."  
"...Okay."  
I knew it!  
  
Come to think of it, this girl... Tamachii, isn't she the ghost I
glimpsed during the Utan incident? I think I've seen her here and there
since then. Wasn't the person who taught Aki and Rin how to survive
before disappearing also a girl in a sailor uniform?  
...She's a girl with maximum suspiciousness, but I'm still giving her a
ride because she doesn't seem like a bad person... I don't sense any
malice. On the contrary, I even feel comfortable around her. It's just
that I can't keep up with the absurdities.  
  
"Aha, look, look, Hanatsubaki-chan, a whale! Oiiiii!"  
As Tamachii leaned out of the passenger window and waved, an island
whale, which I think I've seen before, sprayed a spout of water like a
geyser, creating a large rainbow. As if answering Tamachii's call.  
...She's really suspicious, though!  
  
We crossed the bridge before dark and entered Kanagawa. From there, we
headed along the coast and ended up staying at a deserted inn where the
door was unlocked. For some reason.  
Tamachii made seared tuna for us with tuna she got. From somewhere. But
it was so delicious that I held back my questions.  
"Looky, live seafood!"  
***"Wafun!"***  
"Hachibei..."  
He's been completely bribed!  
  
Since Tamachii has become a fellow traveler, I was bracing myself,
thinking she might tell me something. But surprisingly, nothing has
happened, leaving me feeling anticlimactic.  
What's her purpose?  
"Hanatsubaki-chan, this way’s better."  
"Okay~"  
Somehow, she's looking at a road map of this region, but I won't ask!  
But when we actually went there, there were hardly any abandoned cars on
the road, and it seemed we were able to pass through relatively
undamaged areas, so our journey was progressing smoothly.  
But...  
  
"Aha, here here! The hot spring inn with a natural outdoor bath!"  
"Tamachii, you were aiming for this place from the start, weren't
you!?"  
No wonder I thought we were going deeper and deeper!  
It wasn't a large hot spring inn, but a small one known only to those in
the know. Because of that, it had escaped the encroachment of giant
trees and maintained its original appearance almost entirely.  
Well, it can't be helped that it's covered in dust and weeds. If you
look closely, there seemed to be a small vegetable garden among the
weeds, with wild garlic and chives growing. But they were originally
like wild grasses anyway.  
There's a natural hot spring in the forest behind the inn, and it seems
to be an outdoor bath.  
I don't know if hot water is still gushing out without being buried in
soil and grass, but Tamachii, who was already wearing a yukata she found
at the inn, was eager to go, so we all decided to take a bath.  
  
"Just wait, you’ll see~!"  
Tamachii, wearing a yukata, carrying a towel and a yellow washbasin,
walked through the forest lined with stone pavement with a light step.  
"I see..."  
I really wonder what she's thinking... Her scent and appearance are that
of a normal human, but I feel like something is different.  
Well actually, there are so many things to point out that I don't know
where to start...  
"Hanatsubaki-chan, onigiri?"  
Tamachii, with her mouth full of onigiri, offered me a salted rice ball
(with pickled radish) placed on a bamboo leaf.  
I won't say anything!  
  
***"Unnnnnn"***  
"...!"  
As we advanced further and could see what looked like a hut, Hachibei
growled, and I noticed it a moment later. ...Something’s there!  
"Ah, it’s all good."  
However, while we were wary of the "presence" we suddenly felt, Tamachii
continued forward as if she knew what it was.  
***"Kyuun..."***  
"Yeah, let's go."  
  
Tamachii walked on at a carefree pace, and Hachibei and I cautiously
approached the hut... the changing room for the natural outdoor bath.  
The changing room was quite damaged after over ten years, but it didn’t
seem to be falling apart. The inside was unnaturally well-maintained,
with only a few fallen leaves... Was someone taking care of this?  
"Alright, goin' in~!"  
"Ah, wait..."  
Before I could stop her, Tamachii, who had at some point wrapped a bath
towel around herself, headed towards the outdoor bath.  
"―!"  
Then... as if drawn by that, I went out of the changing room, and
there...  
"...Ape?"  
  
"It" glared at me as I muttered.  
It was a giant ape, about five meters tall, with a jet-black face and
snow-white fur, different from gorillas or orangutans. It was soaking in
the hot spring.  
"It's ok."  
Tamachii smiled as she stopped me by placing her hand over mine as I
reflexively reached for my antler spear.  
What is this... a Yeti or something? I felt the same strong power as the
Raijū from this individual. But the reason I didn't notice its
"presence" until I got close, despite its immense power, was because I
didn't sense any hostility from it.  
  
***"..."***  
The outdoor bath was spacious, but the Yeti, due to its large size, was
only doing a foot bath instead of a half-body soak. It glared at us once
more and scratched the nearby ground with its claws.  
There...  
***"If you want bath, take off clothes."***  
"..."  
"Ahaha, true tue."  
Tamachii took off her towel and jumped into the hot water. The Yeti
frowned at Tamachii but sighed as if giving up and placed a small hand
towel on its head.  
"...Let's go in."  
***"Wau..."***  
  
I resigned myself, took off my leather armor in the changing room,
poured hot water over myself, and soaked in the hot water with
Hachibei.  
Is this okay...? I've never even considered taking a bath with a giant
creature I'm encountering for the first time.  
Some giant creatures were friendly like Hachibei and his family, but in
most cases, they used their increased intelligence to push others down
and try to eliminate them. The Yeti showed no interest in us, who were
naturally wary and cautious of it as an enemy.  
Occasionally... it looked somewhere and frowned slightly, but I realized
it was towards Mount Fuji, and I frowned in the same way.  
***"..."***  
The Yeti narrowed its eyes at me like that before closing them as they
were.  
I couldn't read any emotion from its attitude, but somehow I felt like I
had been acknowledged by this Yeti and quietly exhaled.  
...Come to think of it, this is the first time I've taken a proper
bath.  
  
"There's a buncha folk like this too. The 'World''s constantly
changing."  
"Yeah... it is."  
As I stared at the chilled "fruit milk" handed to me by Tamachii, I
nodded with conviction.  
But, I won't say anything!
