# 77 Raijū

*TN: Raijū -\> Thunder Beast, but keeping it*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

―Roar!!  
Thunder rumbled from the cloudy sky along with lightning, illuminating
the figure of the "beast."  
A wide road covered in trees. The enormous creature, using the buildings
that jutted out from the road as footholds, was clearly... too
bizarre.  
  
The giant body of the "beast," which had sunk its teeth into the throat
of a massive male lion one size larger than a female lion, exceeded
twenty meters in total length.  
Wasn't that giant male the one that claimed Tokyo as its territory? It
seems several male lions with the blood of the leader had been confirmed
in the lion's pride, but the difference in size was so great that one
might mistake the one being devoured for one of those cubs.  
And―  
  
***"―――――... Gaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"***  
The giant male lion, which had been listless with its throat bitten,
roared as if summoning its last strength, and clawed at the "beast's"
neck.  
―Clang!  
Making a sound that one wouldn't expect from claws on fur, it was
deflected, but the giant male lion, which escaped from the momentarily
loosened fangs, sprayed a large amount of blood from its neck, jumped
from rooftop to rooftop, and attacked the "beast" with all its might.  
But...  
***"―――――"***  
The "beast" twisted its mouth as if bored, glared down as if looking
down on all living things other than itself, and shot a strong light
from its "horn."  
  
Doooooooon!!  
  
***"――Gaaaaaaaahhhhh..."***  
The giant male lion was shot through by the released "lightning" and
burned in an instant, falling into the forest below while exhaling white
smoke from its mouth.  
... There's no mistake. That's the source of the "thunder" that was
heard during the attack on the shelter.  
  
"Everyone, get back!!"  
The light of the lightning hadn't subsided yet, and I raised my voice
when I realized it was directed at us.  
At my shout, the special forces moved the general soldiers and
technicians back. But, it was no good. The children who were by my side
weren't at a distance where they could evacuate immediately!  
"―Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!"  
I raised my voice as I leaped forward. At the same time as the "beast's"
lightning was shot at us, my "Dragon's Breath" was released as a flash
of light.  
  
―Dooooooooon!!!!  
  
The flash of light completely covered the vision that had grown
accustomed to the dim light, and the two powers that collided shattered
the remaining windows of the buildings and blew away the humans.  
"......"  
The dragon's breath and lightning counteracted each other, blowing away
the clouds for an instant, and the light shining through revealed the
shape of the "beast".  
Simply put, it was a black tiger. What was different from a normal tiger
was that its fur was black and the stripes were red. And the single
silver horn that grew from its forehead.  
That horn released lightning as if it was charged, and the same silver
eyes stared only at me.  
The black tiger... no, the "Raijū," understood. That "I" was the only
one who could fight it here.  
  
***"Gaa..."***  
The Raijū, with a body so large that a ten-story building looked small,
skillfully changed its posture without breaking the building. As it
leaned forward, the corners of its mouth twisted into a wide grin.  
***"Gaaaaawwwwoooooooooooooooooooooo!!"***  
The Raijū roared towards the sky, causing black clouds to swirl and
lightning to flash―  
"Everyone, run!!"  
  
Doooooon!!  
The Raijū, which leaped out as if leaving the sound behind, attacked
me.  
"―Tch!"  
In an instant, I grew scales on both arms and jumped forward, using the
antler spear spewing flames to block the swing of the Raijū's claws that
were releasing sparks of lightning.  
―Clang!!  
"Kyaa!"  
"Jennifer!"  
The children who were trying to stand up were blown away again by the
impact of the lightning and fire colliding.  
"Get back!!"  
  
I shouted towards the back while being bounced back by the difference in
physique. This thing isn't just a gigantic version of a normal creature.
It's clearly beyond the norm.  
"Tsubaki!"  
Even so, Jennifer, who had been fighting as a part of the Giant Beast
Countermeasures Unit, took aim with her sniper rifle while being blown
away, and fired at the Raijū.  
However, the attack grazed the Raijū and was deflected by its fur and
then it became aware of Jennifer's existence with a dissatisfied
expression.  
***"... Grrr"***  
"Tch"  
The Raijū's "presence" attacked Jennifer as pressure.  
The other children were also unable to move due to the pressure, while
the special forces were away to evacuate the technicians.  
  
***"Wau!"***  
At that moment, Hachibei, who was with the children, growled and jumped
at the Raijū.  
"Hachibei!!"  
Boom!!  
At the moment the Raijū's claws were about to slash Hachibei, I managed
to arrive in time and kicked the Raijū's cheek. The claws that cut
through the air were directed at me, scraping the asphalt on the
ground.  
―Clang!  
I blocked the claw with my spear and “heat” erupted from my entire body.
The Raijū took distance as if wary and landed gracefully on a nearby
building.  
  
"Hachibei! Jennifer, are you alright!?"  
***"Wafun!"***  
"... I'm... alright!"  
Hachibei might have died, but his fighting spirit hadn't weakened.
Jennifer had regained her composure and steadied her rifle. Seeing her
like that the other children regained their fighting spirit.  
"Are you alright!"  
The special forces who had evacuated the technicians returned there.  
Humans are in danger of instant death from the Raijū's attacks. If
possible, I want them to run away. But these people have survived in
such a dangerous world. They are by no means weak.  
If the humans were to support me, I could fight. But―  
  
***"... Grrr..."***  
The Raijū leaked a dissatisfied growl at the sight. That Raijū seems to
be seeking a fight and was enjoying it. When I took a step forward and
readied my weapon, as if it was going to do something, the Raijū
suddenly turned its face towards the sky.  
***"Gaaaaawwwwoooooooooooooooooooooo!!"***  
The Raijū's roar shook the cloudy sky. But wasn’t not the kind of roar
that put on "pressure" to start a fight like before. This is…  
  
As if guided by that roar, giant male lions and giant hyenas appeared
from the shadows of the ruined buildings.  
Why are they here? Weren't they fighting alongside the leader of the
pride? But I quickly understood the answer. The giant creatures had lost
their will to fight. They were terrified, and it was clear that the
target of their fear was that Raijū.  
A slight sense of déjà vu... that eerie atmosphere was the same as the
giant creatures that attacked the shelter. Those giant creatures at that
time were running away in fear of this Raijū.  
And the giant creatures that remained here―  
"Everyone, be careful!"  
  
***"―Gaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"***  
The giant creatures that suddenly began to move and attacked us... no,
the humans.  
"Jennifer! Hachibei!"  
"Tsubaki!"  
***"Wau!"***  
The children and the special forces responded instinctively, and
Hachibei leaped out to protect Jennifer and the others. Seeing this, I
was about to rush in to provide support when a lightning bolt surged
towards me.  
"Tch―"  
  
***"Gaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"***  
Clang!!  
The Raijū pounced on me as I dodged the lightning strike, and my spear
spewed flames as it collided with its claws.  
"Haaaaaaaaaaaa!!"  
The Raijū's lightning intercepted the flames I spat out. We both jumped
back as if repelled, and glared at each other from the top of two
buildings across the road.  
I grew scales on my legs and back, spread scaly, bright red wings from
my back, bristled the scales all over my body sharply, and spewed flames
that filled the rooftop. The Raijū also released lightning from its horn
and bristled its fur as if wearing it all over its body.  
I understand... Since you want it so badly, I'll be your opponent!
