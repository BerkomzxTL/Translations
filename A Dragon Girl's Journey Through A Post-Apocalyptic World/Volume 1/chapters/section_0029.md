# 29 \[Side Story\] Jinbei's Tribulations

Bau!  
  
Today, too, Jinbei patrols the vegetable patch. At first, mice and
raccoons would come to target the vegetables, but Jinbei would chase
them away, and ever since the world got colder, they’ve rarely been seen
anymore.
Previously, it was just a matter of patrolling the vegetable patch left
behind by “Master,” but recently, protecting the home garden has also
become Jinbei’s duty.  
Until a little while ago, there was someone else here. Jinbei taught
that person, who knew nothing, where to find food and water, ate meals
together, slept together, and she was a precious companion who hunted a
boar together with him.  
  
Jinbei’s only “Masters” were the elderly couple who used to live in this
house.  
A long time ago, smoke rose from the “tower” visible in the distance,
and Jinbei, who was still young, was frightened by the distant howls of
beasts. After that, several people came to talk to Master, who seemed
very depressed.  
And after a few days, Master removed Jinbei’s collar, gave him a sad
look, and allowed Jinbei to enter the tatami room.  
Since then, Master went out and hasn't returned. But Jinbei has
protected this vegetable patch so that Master could return anytime.  
Jinbei’s only Masters are that elderly couple. But that being with horns
and a tail was a precious “companion” who fought alongside Jinbei.  
  
When his companion left this place, she reached out her hand towards
him. She was probably telling him to come with her. But Jinbei has the
duty of protecting “Master’s” vegetable patch.  
Jinbei promised the companion who left this place that he would protect
the home garden that the companion cherished, so that, just like Master,
she would not have a sad face.  
But…  
  
Kyuu~n…  
  
It was lonely without any "friends" to throw a ball and play together
with.  
A few days later, it gradually got colder, and after a few more days, it
started to snow.  
  
Bau bau!  
  
Jinbei loves this cold, white stuff that falls from the sky.  
It changes shape, melts in the mouth, and unlike playing in the dirt,
Master wouldn't scold him.  
As a Japanese dog resistant to the cold, neither the snow nor the cold
was a hardship.  
However, in winter, the water channels sometimes freeze, and vegetables
become scarce, making it difficult to find food. But this year, there
was the “meat” left by his companion, so he wouldn't get too hungry.  
  
That huge boar was truly terrifying. He fought alongside his companion
to protect Master’s vegetable patch, but his companion suffered a
serious injury.  
Fortunately, because Jinbei licked the wound and healed it, she didn’t
die, but the companion was also a little scared at that time.  
But soon his companion recovered and, after defeating the huge boar, let
out a victorious howl.  
His companion ate the boar’s meat raw, but Jinbei felt something
invisible from the “meat”, the same as with the boar, and was too scared
to eat it.  
However, once his companion cooked it, the fear disappeared, and he was
able to eat it normally.  
He could also eat the thin slices of meat his companion had left behind
just fine.  
His companion, who ate the meat raw, seemed to have become stronger.
Jinbei was scared to eat raw meat, but after licking the companion’s
wound, he felt like he had somehow become a little stronger as well.  
However, even if his body had become somewhat stronger, the larger chunk
of meat the companion left behind, even bigger than Jinbei, was too
tough to eat.  
  
Since then, the snow hasn’t stopped. Playing in the snow alone got
boring quickly. Because his body had become stronger, the cold was less
bothersome than last year, but his spirits were low.  
A mournful roar, like an echo from the distant tower, could be heard…
and he was reminded of his departed companion.  
Jinbei had always been alone. He’d been like this for ten years, but
having a companion, even for a short time, reminded him of his Masters
and made him feel lonely.  
But, at that time, Jinbei didn’t realize that this loneliness was the
same as “peace.”  
  
Bau!?  
  
It appeared suddenly. From the tracks in the snow, it seemed to have
come from the forest.  
It was a huge “wolf.”  
In the white snow, its majestic figure with pure white fur was so
beautiful that Jinbei was captivated.  
However… the white wolf was five meters in length.  
  
Awooooooooo  
  
Thinking that this huge white wolf was surely like that huge boar,
Jinbei whimpered, crouching low. However, the white wolf took one look
at Jinbei then crouched down in the snow.  
There, Jinbei noticed that the white wolf’s fur was stained with blood,
staining the white snow red.  
Surely, this white wolf must have fought a huge animal like that boar,
won or lost, and drifted here with its injuries.  
Looking closely, there were bloodstains continuing along with the tracks
leading from the forest.  
It looked quite weak. Without food, it might die.  
A terrifying huge wolf, just like the huge boar… But Jinbei, who had
felt loneliness after his companion left, hurried back to the house and
presented the white wolf with the huge piece of smoked meat he had
dragged along.  
  
Bau!  
  
***Gau…***  
The white wolf looked suspiciously, its black eyes reflecting Jinbei,
who looked proud, and the smoked meat.  
Maybe it’s hard to eat with him around. After Jinbei barked again and
returned to the house, a sound like bones and meat being crushed could
be heard behind him.  
The next morning…  
  
Bau…  
  
***Gau***  
While Jinbei slept on the wooden floor of the tatami room, the white
wolf was in the garden in front of the house.  
Compared to the white wolf’s huge body, it was a small piece of meat,
but after eating, its strength had returned, and its injuries seemed to
have mostly healed. The white wolf dropped a pure white rabbit in front
of Jinbei.  
Jinbei hadn't seen a rabbit in quite some time. At least, there weren’t
any around here, so it must have hunted one from far away.  
***Gau***  
The white wolf urged Jinbei to hurry up and eat.  
It was probably a thank you for the day before, but it had been a long
time since Jinbei had such a large catch, and he hesitated. Then, the
white wolf bit the rabbit into pieces, and Jinbei, presented with the
dismembered rabbit, had no choice but to eat.  
***Gau***  
Once Jinbei started eating the rabbit, the white wolf wore a satisfied
expression and, for some reason, entered the narrow wooden-floored room
and laid down in Jinbei's bed.  
  
Bau!?  
  
When Jinbei barked in protest, the white wolf approached and sniffed
Jinbei. Jinbei also sniffed and realized that this white wolf was a
“female.”  
What does this female want? Jinbei didn’t understand why she took his
bed, and was left confused and whimpering. As the white wolf, who had
been sniffing, stared at Jinbei, a chill went through him. The moment
Jinbei tried to escape, the white wolf’s foreleg pinned him down.  
  
Kyuu~n…  
  
***Gau***  
Am I going to be eaten? Jinbei thought.  
The white wolf smiled menacingly at the trembling Jinbei, and held him
down as if to say that she would never let him go.  
***Gau***  
  
And so, Jinbei was “eaten” by the female white wolf, and while lying on
his back, he could only count the stains on the ceiling until the matter
ended.  
  
Bau~…  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
*Will Jinbei, who was eaten in various senses, find happiness!?*  
  
*Please be patient until next time!*
