# 10 Jinbei's Farm (5)

The boar was furious. But instead of letting out its anger on a rampage,
it simply waited patiently in the depths of the forest for its wounds
and pain to heal.  
Even the giant boar wasn't born large. When it was smaller than it was
now, its surroundings were full of danger. But as its body grew and it
gained "intelligence," it learned that its large body and thick fur
could become powerful "weapons."  
Its omnivorous nature fortunately allowed it to grow even larger. There
was nothing that could defeat the giant boar; it could easily tear apart
anything with a swipe of its tusks. The giant boar, which claimed this
region as its territory, believed itself to be "noble" due to its high
intelligence.  
But its pride had been defiled.  
An impertinent little animal that incessantly annoyed it with its
irritating "cries."  
And then the two-legged creature that tried to drive it away along with
that small animal.  
It had its eye gouged out by that two-legged creature with its strange
"aura." Confused by the intense "pain," a first for it since birth, it
left the scene, but once it calmed down, "anger" welled up inside.  
It wouldn't forgive. It absolutely could not forgive that two-legged
creature that injured it and inflicted pain upon its noble self.  
  
It pierced the creature's torso with its tusk. But that two-legged
creature wasn't dead.  
It still felt that dreadful "presence," and it felt it gradually growing
stronger.  
***"BumoOoo……"***  
The boar decided to stop waiting. Instead of healing its wounds and
eliminating the pain, the giant boar decided to unleash all this pain,
this humiliation, and began to move again.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
Snap……crackle……  
Crack.  
Mixed with the sound of the crackling bonfire, the scales covering the
small wounds on my hands and feet peeled off.  
The scales covering the wounds were as hard as steel, but as the wounds
healed they lost their hardness, and the scales that turned black and
fell off crumbled easily when crushed between my fingers.  
The fact that parts of the scales, which had been red while healing,
turned black might mean it was expelling toxins, similar to my stomach.
In fact, after crushing them with my fingers, something like soil
remained.  
  
Bau…  
  
"It's nothing, Jinbei."  
Jinbei approached and licked the areas where the scales had peeled
off.  
I had taught him not to lick the scales because they were hard and
dangerous, but it seems he understood that it was okay to lick them
after they peeled off.  
"Ahaha, that tickles. It's okay now."  
After Jinbei licked and cleaned the injured areas, there wasn't even a
single scar or stain on my reddish-tan skin.  
As always, my body is still out of the ordinary, but I'm grateful for it
now.  
It's not just about the healing of my wounds. With this power, I can
protect Jinbei... and the house and fields that Jinbei tried to
protect.  
  
Thud……  
  
"Here it comes..."  
As the moon rose high in the sky, Jinbei and I, armed with my spear,
looked up at its arrival whilewaiting in the garden.  
The giant boar is here. I could feel a strong "aura" approaching along
with the vibrations.  
Just as I can sense its aura, it sensed mine, and it was coming straight
here.  
"Let's go, Jinbei."  
  
Bau!  
  
I readied my spear and ran in the direction the boar was coming from
with Jinbei.  
I didn't tell Jinbei to "wait." Jinbei also has the desire to protect
the fields left behind by his master, and I don't think I should stop
him because of my feelings.  
Still, I don't intend to let Jinbei fight. I’ll settle this with my own
hands… here and now.  
  
Running through the fields with Jinbei, we arrived at the outer
perimeter to meet the giant boar before it reached the garden.  
The moon provided good visibility, so I could see without any problems.
And, from the unseen darkness of the forest, the giant boar appeared,
crushing the trunk of a tree that it had cut down previously.  
Thud…!  
  
***"Bururu ru ru……"***  
  
Blood was still dripping from the wound of its crushed eye, and its
remaining eye glared at me with hatred. Jinbei beside me crouched down
and growled as if mustering up his courage.  
As I brandished the spear that gouged out its eye, the giant boar
lowered its body slightly and tensed its muscles as it glared at me.  
It's wary of this antler spear.  
The giant deer's antler… the spear, tinged faintly red from absorbing my
blood, was originally as hard as iron, but now it’s strong and sharp
enough to easily pierce a vending machine.  
It's wary of the antler spear but probably thinks of me as an
insignificant little creature.  
And it's furious that that little creature injured it.  
But…  
You underestimate me… us.  
  
I tightened my grip on the spear. I turned the dull throbbing pain of my
wound into "heat" as my blood boiled with fighting spirit in this clear
battle against my "enemy".  
As I channeled that "heat" into my arms, my forearms became covered in
red scales, rippling up from my fingertips with red claws, and the spear
I held grew "redder."  
  
“HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!”  
***"BUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
  
The giant boar and I screamed and lunged at the same time.  
The ground I stepped on was blown back as if it were gouged out, and in
an instant, we closed in on each other.  
The giant boar's mammoth-like, sharp tusks aimed for my heart. I
countered by pouring all my "heat" into my arms and thrust with all my
might.  
  
Gakyiiiiiiiin!!  
  
***"Bumoooooooooooooooooo!!"***  
  
The antler spear and the huge tusk collided. A brief stalemate, but I
came out on top in the end.  
The tusk that collided with my spear shattered, and the giant boar
roared in intense pain.  
“Taaaa!”  
I took advantage of the opening and swung the spear at the boar's
remaining eye. But the giant boar, sensing it a moment faster, turned
its head, and the spear pierced its cheek.  
It's no use; the skin and subcutaneous fat were too thick, and the tip
couldn’t reach the flesh.  
***"BuoOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
The giant boar swung its remaining tusk like a headbutt, flinging me and
the spear away.  
“――!”  
As I rolled around, scraping the ground along with the weeds, the
furious giant boar charged towards me like a train.  
When I got up and dodged sideways, the boar, having learned its lesson,
swung its tusk horizontally, and I quickly blocked it with the scales on
my arm, but the scales peeled off, and blood gushed out.  
“This oooooh!”  
I channeled "heat" into my arm and punched the boar between its eyes
with all my might.  
Gwooon!!  
***"――!!"***  
There was a sound like rocks being smashed together, and its forehead
was dented neatly in the shape of my fist.  
But that's all. My light weight means I need speed and momentum to make
my strikes more effective.  
“The spear!?”  
  
――Bau.  
  
"Jinbei!"  
Jinbei dragged the spear in its mouth back to me. I momentarily
separated myself from the giant boar and picked it up.  
“Stay back!”  
I channeled the "heat" from my arm into the spear and charged again at
the giant boar.  
"HAAAAAAAHH!!"  
Gaining momentum, the tip of the reddened antler spear blew away the
flesh under the giant boar's chin. But it was shallow. It only blew away
the fur and fat.  
***"BumooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
The boar roared in fierce pain and anger, raising its upper body using
only its lower body.  
It's huge! Like a wall.  
For a moment, I stopped in my tracks under its imposing size, and the
giant boar brought its upper body down.  
  
BOOM!!  
  
“Gah!”  
The monster swung its jaw down on me, slamming me to the ground. My body
was buried by the impact, which must have weighed several tons, and
blood poured from my mouth.  
***"Buoooooooo!"***  
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”  
The giant boar put its weight on me in an attempt to crush me, but I
resisted with all my might.  
No matter how tough my body is, the damage was severe. Even if I try to
put "heat" into my "voice" like I did when I killed the giant deer, I
just don't have enough "heat."  
My strength gradually faded, and just as I braced myself for the end—  
  
Bau bau bau!!  
  
Jinbei barked ferociously and lunged, and at that moment, the giant
boar's movement faltered.  
Now's my chance!  
“Uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”  
I screamed and plunged my red claws… into the flesh under its chin,
which I had gouged with the spear, and tore it violently.  
***"BuooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
The giant boar, with its wound dug open, raised its chin. I devoured the
torn flesh, put the "heat" that blazed inside my body into both legs,
and kicked up the jaw of the giant boar, which was about the size of a
car, with both legs covered with crimson scales that rippled like
waves.  
***"――――!?"***  
  
Bau bau!!  
  
Jinbei jumped out and pounced at the giant boar's head. The attack,
which couldn't even leave a scratch, made the boar's remaining eye
flutter slightly.  
“Taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”  
Taking advantage of that brief moment, I jumped forward with all my
might and filled my arm with “heat”.  
I'll settle this here!  
My bright red scales stood on end, and I thrust my hand, with sharp red
claws, into the giant boar's remaining eye all the way up to my elbow.  
***"Bu~ooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
  
Even with my arm thrust into its brain, the giant boar continued to
thrash around.  
It gouged the ground and snapped trees, but still I didn't let go,
digging my claws deeper and crushing its brain.  
***"Bo……"***  
The giant boar continued running for several meters, dragging me along
with it, then its body shook with a jerk, “Bikun”, and it stopped
moving, slowly collapsing... and never moved again.  
  
“…………I wonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!”  
Bauuuuuu!  
I pulled my arm out, threw myself down on the ground, and together with
Jinbei I let out a cry of victory... and then I fell into a deep
sleep.  
  
The next morning….  
  
"Jinbei, won't you eat?"  
Kyuu~n…  
  
Jinbei flinched and backed away from the chunk of meat I presented to
him, curling his tail under his body.  
I managed to defeat the giant boar after a fierce battle. But if I leave
the carcass near the field, it might attract other unknown creatures
looking for its flesh, so I decided to dispose of it.  
But it was as big as a bus, so I first had to butcher it. Moreover, like
the giant deer's hide, it could only be cut with my claws or spear, so
it was a pain.  
When I woke up, my arms, which had been covered in scales, had gone back
to normal. It was a relief, but at the same time I felt a little
disappointed as they would’ve made the butchering easier.  
First, I cut the neck and base of the legs to drain some blood. Hanging
it would probably drain more, but I gave up because it’d be impossible
to hang something this big without a large crane.  
Then, I split open its belly and removed the innards. It must have had a
bad diet, because the organs had a rather unpleasant smell, and most of
them had to be thrown away.  
  
Guuuu~....  
Maybe because my injuries weren't fully healed, my stomach rumbled at
the sight of the fresh meat. Raw meat is dangerous, but my stomach has
been strengthened, so it'll probably be fine….  
I roughly cut the meat and wondered what to do with it, then showed
Jinbei the fresh heart and liver I had kept. I asked him if he wanted to
eat some, but before refusing, he was too afraid to even approach.  
"I guess it can't be helped…"  
It's the enemy's meat. It can't be helped. I'll eat it alone.  
I'll start with the heart still dripping with blood. I tore into it with
my claws and bit into it, along with the overflowing blood.  
“Mmm…yeah.”  
There was less of an aversion than I thought there would be... and
before I knew it, I found myself gobbling down the sweet flesh.  
I guess I was more hungry than I realized. The heart alone was about the
same size as me when curled up, yet it disappeared into my stomach as if
by magic.  
“……Kepu.”  
Then I reached for the liver. I bit into it, and a rich flavor spread in
my mouth. As I ate, I felt "heat" in my stomach again.  
Has my stomach been strengthened again? But as I continued to eat, the
heat spread throughout my body, and when I finished eating the liver,
the scales covering my wounds peeled off with a cracking sound.  
  
Bau!  
  
"Yeah, it's healed."  
When the scab-like scales peeled off from the wounds, all the wounds had
disappeared without a trace.  
I was quite exhausted from fighting while injured, but eating the heart
returned me to a net zero from a negative state. And when I ate the
liver, my stomach was full, and I felt "heat" fill my whole body.  
“Nn?”  
  
Bau bau!  
  
Jinbei ran around me curiously, playing with my long tail.  
"Hey, don't do that."  
My body has changed again.  
First, my tail, which was about thirty centimeters long, has grown to
about fifty centimeters, as thick as my arm. Then, when I touched my
head, the red horns, which had been about ten centimeters long, had also
grown by a few centimeters.  
It's only a small amount, but it's a curious change for Jinbei, and a
dramatic change for me.  
My tail, which I could only move slightly, can now be moved freely, like
a leg. It's still short though, so it's not useful yet.  
The horns… won't they get in the way if they grow too long?  
  
Then I borrowed a shovel from the house's shed and dug a large hole far
from the fields.  
I took several parts from the boar, and together with Jinbei, I threw
the butchered boar into the hole, covered it with a large amount of
fallen leaves and dead branches, and then cremated it.  
  
We won. This is our victory, mine and Jinbei's.  
Let's think about it for a moment... Why did the giant boar flinch when
Jinbei barked?  
In the first place, even though Jinbei was here, why did it leave most
of the crops in the field uneaten?  
Maybe… Maybe the boar was chased by dogs before it became so huge.
That's why it was probably startled and retreated without thinking.  
I don't know the truth. But the fact is it actually flinched at Jinbei
and showed a fatal opening.  
So this victory is both of ours, one person and one animal.  
  
The boar carcass, which is still wet, will continue to burn for a few
more days even with a large amount of firewood added to it.  
Jinbei and I gazed deeply at the burning flames and rising smoke before
turning our backs as dusk approached.  
  
"Let's go home, Jinbei."  
Bau!  
  
Let's go back to that house… to do my "final" task.
