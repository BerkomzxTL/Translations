# 14 Life Along The River

I was made aware of how lucky I've been up until now.  
Up until now, even with that giant deer and giant boar, they were single
targets, so I could somehow win and even had the will to fight back. But
really…  
"Four at once is just not fair…"  
  
Deer and boar do stick together as family units, but I feel like they
generally act alone. But, if they're pack animals, I should have
anticipated encountering multiple at once.  
Furthermore, considering they made the tallest building in this area
their base, unless those black giant apes were recently born, they're a
pack that survived battles with humans.  
Honestly, I don't think I can survive fighting that many…  
Even the first and largest one I saw first was two building windows
across… at least six meters tall.  
Even if I somehow managed to lure them out one by one, they also had
normal-sized apes with them, so if those made a fuss, the others would
come running.  
But…  
"I don't have any reason to fight those guys…"  
If they attack me, it would be unavoidable. But, we don’t have a
conflict of interest, so attacking them feels wrong somehow.  
  
I ended up coming all the way back to the river, but I feel like I
didn't need to run this far.  
Until I climbed onto the roof of that hospital, neither I nor the apes
noticed each other, so I think they weren't moving to attack something,
but rather, they were claiming that high-rise building area as their
territory.  
If that's the case, if I avoided the area around the building, I could
have gone around and explored the commercial buildings. But, right now
the apes are probably still on alert, and more than anything, I was so
startled that I don’t want to go near them for a while.  
  
"Where should I go…"  
I was aiming for that building, so my purpose is up in the air, and I'm
just dumbfounded.  
As dusk fell, while listening to the sound of the river flowing, I idly
followed the flowing water with my eyes, and I somehow came up with an
idea.  
"That's right, I'll go to the sea."  
I don't know the geography at all, but a river this big must flow
straight into the sea.  
I want to eat some fish from the sea. It's a spur-of-the-moment
decision, but I've decided on the *sea* as my goal for now.  
It might not fit my purpose of finding out what happened to this world,
but my “knowledge” doesn’t become my own unless I actually see and
experience it, so seeing the sea and the journey there will all become
part of my “life”.  
That day, I climbed a large tree to a ruined apartment building, and
slept in a room where the window lock was open.  
  
Good morning. The next morning, I woke up on a sofa I borrowed on the
upper floor of the apartment, returned to the river, and used the river
water to wash away the dust.  
Even though it’s practically a ruin, I obviously can't make a campfire
inside the apartment, so I made a campfire on the riverbank, roasted,
and ate dried meat. I ate it as it was last night, but it’s definitely
softer and tastier when roasted.  
I wonder if Jinbei is eating properly…  
I felt like I ate quite a lot of meat, but I think I still have over ten
kilograms left.  
Yesterday… while I was running away, the thought of tossing aside my
belongings flashed across my mind for a moment. In the end, I had the
physical ability to spare and I didn’t want to throw away the meat
Jinbei and I made, so I brought it back, but I feel like it would be
better to eat it sooner if it’s going to get in the way of my
movement.  
  
"For now, if I follow the river, I’ll reach the sea?"  
Also, living along the river means there's plenty of water available.
Plus, there are river fish, so I won't have trouble with food.  
But a diet of only protein is a bit… Although my carnivorous body might
be okay with it, I think I should eat something other than meat at least
once a day. …For mood purposes.  
I continued walking along the riverbank.  
Looking at it from here, most of the buildings are short and buried
under trees. Still, the fact that I could still tell it was a city or
town is because I could see apartments and buildings peeking out from
between the trees here and there.  
Considering that, maybe this area isn’t that big of a city after all?  
I think it’s definitely a city since there were that many buildings and
streets, but considering the mountainous farm where Jinbei was, passing
through the forest, then immediately reaching the city, the city limits
must be small.  
The geography of this area… I can’t tell which direction to go if I
don’t know where I am, whether it’s north or south. Even if there are
place names written on telephone poles, it’s not helpful if it’s the
name of a small region instead of the prefecture.  
  
"Ah…"  
…Rain? Around noon, I was thinking of catching some fish in the river,
when it suddenly started raining.  
The clouds had been gradually increasing, so I wasn't too surprised, but
the sky got darker and darker, and the raindrops got stronger, so I
quickly took shelter under a large tree.  
…If I think about it, getting wet might not affect me that much.  
The fur clothes might get damaged if they get too wet, but that’s a
problem for later; they repel water to some extent, and I could even put
the clothes in a plastic garbage bag and walk naked.  
But, moisture is bad for the dried meat. I’ve put it in a plastic bag
just in case, but it might get moldy if it gets too damp.  
  
"Is it going to keep raining…"  
Just to be safe, in the shade of the tree, I collected some dry branches
that weren't wet yet and put them in a garbage bag, but the rain showed
no sign of stopping, and puddles were gradually approaching my feet.  
"Let's go."  
I made an immediate decision to move. I put my removed fur clothes and
leather bag into two 45-liter garbage bags, and ran out in the rain to a
town buried in trees that I saw nearby.  
Splash, splash!  
"Uhyaaaaa"  
As I ran in the rain, making strange noises, I started to have a little
fun.  
The rain was cold, but not cold enough to steal the “heat” inside me,
and it was even quite pleasant.  
  
This area could be called a residential area… but it seems the houses
aren't densely packed, and buildings were scattered among the trees and
weeds.  
It's definitely a “town”, but it has a kind of suburban feel to it.  
Maybe because of that, there were very few destroyed houses, but for
some reason, there were stores with broken shutters in places facing
wide roads.  
"This will do…"  
The glass at the entrance to what appeared to be a storefront, a
single-story building with a glass front, had been broken, but the front
was open—a parking lot?—so the building had been spared from the
encroachment of trees.  
When big trees grow, their roots crack even concrete. The parking lot
was overgrown with weeds, but not enough to become soil, and the inside
was relatively well-preserved.  
"…A supermarket I guess?"  
  
Inside, there were shelves lined with merchandise, and along the back
wall were refrigerated cases of drinks and food.  
After the match between reality and my “knowledge” was complete, and I
recognized this as a supermarket, I looked inside again and found that
there were almost no products left.  
There were some remnants of what might have been prepared foods left on
the shelves, but nothing long-lasting, and shelves with things like
tissues and detergents were also empty.  
Even if supplies stopped coming, did the store manager keep operating
until the very end?  
No… I don't think that's right. There were dust-covered coins scattered
on the counter.  
  
Maybe… but, those giant animals appeared, and everyone evacuated. Most
people probably evacuated then, but some people stayed behind. Then,
some time later, people who ran out of food came and took some.  
…That must be it.  
Now that I think about it, the stores with broken outside shutters are
all food stores and general stores.  
Even if it wasn’t the remaining residents, there's a possibility that
locals from other areas who came by car during their evacuation broke
them and took what they needed. It's just a guess though.  
  
Well, there's a difference between being immediately after the
evacuation with plans to return, or being in ruins already, but I’m in a
similar situation so I won't criticize them.  
But what happened to the people who remained? It seems like a harsh
environment for ordinary humans to survive… While thinking about such
things, I searched for things that could still be used, and once again
realized that there may not be any people left around here anymore.  
There wasn't a single item left in stock, not water, not juice, not
sweets.  
The fact that even the heavy water in plastic bottles, which would have
been a hindrance during evacuation, was gone, is proof that people were
still around even after the infrastructure completely stopped. Still,
the reason I thought there were no people left was because there was
only one type of canned food left.  
"This is one of those that you can't open without a can opener..."  
It looked foreign-made, but it’s not English. Looking at the picture, it
looks like a spicy bean stew?  
Some households might not have can openers, it’s heavy, it looks spicy,
and it probably remained unsold and was left behind. Even so, if people
still remained, they would have taken it even if they had to break the
can to eat it.  
But even those who remained probably didn’t even get to this point, and
felt their limitations within a few weeks after the infrastructure
stopped, and left this place.  
Still…  
"I'll eat it!"  
  
I'll exclude items with a lot of rust on the surface, or cans that are
swollen, because the contents might have leaked.  
I borrowed a few metal shelves and placed them at the entrance with an
overhang, and decided to make a campfire there. …I’m glad I picked up
some dead branches. Then I brought over the canned food and stabbed it
with my tusk knife.  
Clang!  
"…It's not what I expected."  
I was able to make a hole, but it wasn't a clean one. If I were to try
and force it open, the contents would spill, so in the end, I used my
nails to open it little by little.  
"The smell is… okay."  
I put the two opened cans next to the fire to warm them, and a pleasant
aroma wafted through the air.  
"…Spicy!"  
I was flustered by the spicy food I was eating for the first time, and
hurriedly drank water from the bottle.  
Outside, while I was making noise, the sound of rainwater gathering in
the milk pot was playing a quiet tune, like a music box.
