# 16 First Time At The Sea

"It's the seaaaaaaaaa!"  
Three days later, after finally exiting the forest, upon seeing the blue
sea that lay beyond, I impulsively threw down my things and ran towards
it, leaping in—  
"Hiyaa!"  
After being tossed around by large waves, I tumbled and hurriedly
scrambled back to the shore.  
"Wow, that's salty!"  
So this is the sea! Huh! It's not as blue as I thought!  
I got so excited I jumped right in, but salt water isn't good for fur,
is it!  
I hurriedly picked up my belongings and went back upstream, and where
the water turned fresh, I jumped in headfirst.  
  
"The sea!"  
Standing once more on the beach, I raised both hands and shouted towards
the sea.  
  
I properly rinsed my fur clothes in fresh water to remove the salt and
dried it.  
But it’s a little different from the sea I imagined? I had expected a
long stretch of pure white sand and a fishing port, but all I could see
was just a small strip of sandy beach extending from a wide grassland,
directly meeting the sea.  
Well, whatever.  
"Okay, let's go for a swim."  
It's autumn now, and the waves are quite high, but I don't mind, and
it's not cold.  
As a precaution, I filled a plastic bottle I found on the beach with
fresh water, put my belongings in a plastic garbage bag, and started a
fire on the beach.  
I also put the fur clothes I had removed with the rest of my belongings,
stabbed my spear into the ground, and set off!  
  
Splash!  
"Aha!"  
As I ran along the water's edge, the sensation against my feet was
delightful, and my tail wagged vigorously.  
Moving my body feels so good. Thinking it was about time, I waded into
the sea up to my knees, and dove headfirst the moment a wave went out.  
While holding my breath, I opened my eyes slightly. There was slightly
more of a strange sensation than with freshwater, but more than that, I
was surprised by what I saw in the sea.  
Does the sea usually have so little seaweed…? Looking closely, a large
number of black things were densely packed in the crevices of the rocks.
What’s this? Sea urchins?  
They have unusually long spines, and they don't match the sea urchins in
my "knowledge." I might be able to eat them, but their appearance
doesn’t look appealing to me, and since there were only small fish
around, probably because there wasn't much seaweed, I just got out of
the water.  
It's not what I expected!  
  
I reluctantly carried my belongings in the garbage bag and headed south
while holding a burning branch.  
As I continued to walk, the color of the sea seemed to gradually change,
and after about thirty minutes, I set down my luggage and fire, and
entered the sea, where I found more seaweed growing and fish.  
  
I didn't check because I got out so quickly before, but it seems I can
swim properly in the sea even though it’s my first time here. No, I was
able to dive easily, so maybe I don't float?  
Moreover, I can hold my breath for quite a while. I didn't feel short of
breath even after several minutes. I thought I might be able to breathe
underwater, so I tried opening my mouth and almost drowned.  
*"Gobwah"*  
  
The sea had many small fish I didn’t recognize, and not many large ones.
But occasionally there were fish about thirty centimeters long, so I
tried to catch one, but it was faster than me and I couldn't reach it.  
(…Ah!)  
At the edge of my vision, I noticed a single, rather large fish.  
I slowly approached it, being careful not to startle it. Perhaps it
hadn’t seen a human (?) before, it wasn’t very wary of me, but it
instantly ran away the moment I reached out my hand.  
(Eei!)  
Unable to give up, I kicked my feet in the water. That should only have
caused me to struggle, but I suddenly accelerated and grabbed the
fish.  
Eh… what's going on? I was surprised even though I did it myself.
Looking behind me, it seemed I had instinctively used my tail as well as
my feet. I tried waving only my tail like a fish, and was able to swim
quite a distance with just that. I couldn't help but laugh in the sea
and almost drowned again.  
Still, I want to praise myself for not letting go of the fish. Anyway, I
was starting to feel suffocated, so I surfaced, and felt a stinging
sensation on my skin. After checking, I hurriedly returned to the
shore.  
  
"It's a jellyfish…"  
That's right. Jellyfish appear in the autumn… Still, the jellyfish's
stingers didn't seem strong enough to pierce my skin, so I just tossed
it back into the sea with a sigh of relief.  
Now, the sea fish I’ve been longing for! This is… mackerel? Maybe.  
"But doesn't mackerel spoil easily?"  
I don’t think that it’d spoil that quickly, but that's more a matter of
feeling or "vibe." I hurried back to where my luggage was, which was a
bit far away.  
I'm always cautious, but my luggage was unchanged. It seems there aren't
any animals big enough to play pranks. I'm relieved, but it still feels
unnatural.  
There's no point in worrying about things I don't understand. I added
dry driftwood to the smoldering fire to increase the flames, and I'll
start preparing the mackerel!  
"Alright, it's your turn!"  
The tusk knife I took out of my luggage shone brightly in the
sunlight.  
  
Yesterday and the day before, I worked late into the night, and finally
managed to sharpen my tusk knife into a proper blade. It's still too
thick to be called a knife… but for some reason, it started turning
reddish halfway through, and it feels unusually sharp...  
I also managed to make the handle a little thinner, and I still have
some scraps from when I made the leather pouch, so I'll try to make a
proper handle next time.  
"Now then…"  
When I slid the tusk knife over the mackerel on the rock, it was amazing
to see the scales come off effortlessly.  
  
I carefully removed the innards and buried them on the beach. I cut the
mackerel into three pieces and rinsed it with seawater several times
during the process. Well, I'm still not used to it, so it ended up as
more like three or five pieces, but at least I was able to fillet it.  
"...Let's try it."  
Since it's fresh seafood, I'll try eating a piece raw.  
"Mmm… Delicious!"  
I didn't expect it to be this delicious. It's also because of the
saltiness from the seawater, but the strong umami flavor is a different
kind of deliciousness than the raw boar meat.  
It was so delicious that I ended up eating half of it raw without even
removing the small bones. I wanted to eat all of it as is, but since
I’ve done this much, I decided to grill the remaining half.  
The head and remaining bones still had a lot of meat on them so I
roasted those over the fire as well.  
"Mmnnn\~\~~!"  
The salt-grilled mackerel was on a whole other level of deliciousness. I
almost flapped my feet excitedly, and nearly got sand on the bones that
were still being roasted. While holding back, I ate the rest. Finally, I
slowly chewed and crunched on the whole roasted bones and head with my
fangs.  
  
"Fuu~…"  
After eating the large mackerel of almost fifty centimeters, I stretched
my legs out on the beach and exhaled. …I think it was for a big
mackerel, but it wasn't quite enough.  
I think I'll look for it some more... But, I caught that one by chance,
and it seems I'll need tools to catch fish of that size.  
If possible, I'd like to try fishing. I think houses along the coast
might have fishing rods, but why does this area look like a park?
There's only grassland as far as I can see, so I decided to extinguish
the fire and walk south.  
  
"Maybe I should try some seaweed."  
I was thinking about that while walking. Seaweed and kelp can be eaten
by just boiling them, right?  
By the way, I still have my fur clothes stored in my luggage as
protection against the sea breeze. No-one will see me, and it's the sea,
so it's not weird.  
And, even if I don't catch any fish, since I had found those strange sea
urchins, there might also be shellfish. Those can also be eaten just by
roasting them, so I'll look for some.  
"Still..."  
The grassland extends almost to the seashore, and the sandy beach is
narrow. Since I came to the sea, I’ve only been focusing on fish, but
there are plants I've never seen before, so there might be something
edible.  
“…Hm?”  
I noticed a small group of things on a distant island.  
"Mmm… Birds?"  
I don't know if they’re seagulls or black-tailed gulls, but there were
seabirds flying around the island.  
So there are other birds besides small birds… There weren't any crows or
pigeons, so I thought animals of a certain size had disappeared.  
"Can seagulls be eaten..."  
I'm not full yet, so I couldn’t help but let out that thought.  
Maybe I can catch some if I go to that island? But it's a strange
island… It’s quite large, so it should have trees, but there’s only
strangely colored grass.  
Ah… !  
  
Splashhhhhhh!  
  
Suddenly, the sea swelled, and a giant fish emerged from it.  
The huge fish opened its jaws and devoured more than half of the flock
of seabirds in one gulp.  
“…A shark?”  
So they were here, giant creatures! That was definitely a shark. But
judging its size from a distance, it must be at least fifteen meters
long.  
The giant shark devoured the seabirds, leaping up twice, three times.  
The area around that island turned out to be the giant shark's hunting
ground… It’s scary to think that if I had unknowingly swum further out,
I might have been attacked.  
In an instant, it devoured most of the several hundred seabirds. It
seems it wasn’t satisfied, though, as it turned its attention to the
"presence" I was emitting on the shore.  
  
"—!"  
It seems the shark was suppressing its presence in order to target the
seabirds, as it unleashed a powerful "presence" along with killing
intent.  
I quickly threw my luggage behind me and raised my antler spear.  
  
A sea creature coming up onto land…? That's usually impossible. But
according to my "knowledge," killer whales sometimes attack seals on
land.  
Even for a shark of that size, it could probably jump several hundred
meters and return to the sea.  
I can't win against sea creatures in the sea. Should I run? No, it might
attack the moment I turn my back.  
"…"  
The shark and I glared at each other, each watching for an opening.  
But—  
  
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!!  
  
At that moment, the "island" undulated, and a large "mouth" in the sea
attacked the giant shark.  
"—!?"  
A large wave hit me, who was watching dumbfounded, and I was drenched in
seawater. Even as I was tossed about by the waves, I watched in
astonishment as the "island" spouted a huge jet of water, creating a
rainbow in the sky.  
***―――――――――――!!***  
The giant shark let out a soundless scream and was crushed in its
gigantic mouth.  
That wasn't an island! It was several kilometers long, but that was…  
“…A whale…”  
Is this also a kind of giant animal…? There's no way it's something I
should fight.  
It's the same for it too, it seems. For just a moment, it directed its
"presence" towards me, but without particularly caring, it devoured the
giant shark and swam away towards the open sea.  
  
"Aha… Ahahaha! So big!"
