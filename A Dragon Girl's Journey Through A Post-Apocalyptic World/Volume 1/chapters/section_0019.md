# 19 In Search Of A Map

"Uuuu..."  
I've spent a couple of days in this school, poring over books and
cross-referencing my "knowledge," but I still can't figure out why the
town turned to ruins.  
The immediate cause was probably a giant animal, but why did the giant
animals appear? What kind of giant animal was it? What happened after
the fight with the humans? And...  
"Where did all the humans go...?"  
  
I don't think humanity went extinct. I don't think humans are that
weak.  
But at the same time, I also think they didn't all make it
unscathed...  
Even a single giant boar would be impossible to defeat without a tank.
What if it were a bear or a carnivore? With giant sharks and island
whales in the sea like that, fishing and logistics would be impossible.
There might even be giant orcas and octopuses.  
It wouldn’t be surprising if something similar were happening on land,
though with varying degrees.  
What's the world like now...?  
I want to know.  
The only problem is...  
"There's so little information..."  
  
It seems information was only on the internet, as there wasn't even a
newspaper in the library. Not only that, but there wasn't even a map.  
I at least figured out roughly where this place is because the school
has the name of the prefecture on it, but without a map, I can't
pinpoint the exact location. And more importantly, which way should I go
from here, north or south?  
"...It can't be helped."  
I snapped the book shut. I need to stop here, or I'll get lost in
literature and novels forever.  
...The sea is close by so there's food, but I don't want to end up as a
NEET surviving in the wild; that would be too confusing.  
With that decided, I immediately started preparing for my journey. Even
so, the only thing I'm bringing is some dried kelp; I haven't really
gotten anything here.  
"I thought the school would at least have a map..."  
  
If I head to the edge of this town, there might be a large commercial
building, but I gave up on going that far because I was afraid I’d get
lost.  
So my goal is still that big city after all.  
...Those apes were scary, but if I go around from the east side and
sneak in, I should be able to hit a few commercial buildings.  
If there’s a big bookstore, it should definitely have a map… I hope.  
  
First, to avoid getting lost, I headed north towards the sea.  
I'm not going to get that close to the sea, so I'm still wearing my fur
clothing.  
I really want to eat sea fish again. I tried to catch some when I was
looking for shellfish, but they were too fast to catch.  
...Next time, I'll definitely find a fishing rod.  
  
I headed upstream along the path I came from the river. I won't get lost
since I've been this way before, but the difference this time is food.  
...I keep thinking about food all the time, but food is important. A
large part of survival life that isn't camping is searching for food and
water.  
The reason I'm having trouble with food is because I noticed my smoked
meat was starting to spoil.  
I'm an amateur, so it can't be helped, but I think the type of wood I
used for smoking, the time, and the fact that I carried it around in a
plastic bag in a damp place were all bad ideas.  
Basically, it wasn't properly smoked, and I’ve ended up eating it all
before winter came...  
  
Last time, I had dried meat, so I could eat while on the move, but now I
need to take time to search for food.  
Still, there are acorns and a river, so I summoned my strength, entered
the water, and spotted an incredibly large fish shadow. I gave it my all
and stabbed it with my antler spear.  
"What is this..."  
Eh? Another invasive species? Surely it can't be a fish from around
here? It's over a meter long! It has a big head and its eyes are quite
low down. And...  
"Eh, it stinks!"  
The innards and skin smell really bad. But it'll be fine if I process it
properly. Probably!  
It's okay. Most things are fine if you cook them!  
So, I used my tusk knife to skin it, gutted it, and roasted it slowly.
The bones were thick, but it was edible enough. It's big, so it's
fatty...but it still smells bad.  
Looking at it this way, the lack of appropriately sized fish in the sea
is probably because the sharks and whales and other giant animals ate
them all.  
  
And so, I went up the river like that, occasionally climbing up the
apartments along the riverside, and finally, in the distance, I could
see those skyscrapers. It took me days, but if there had been a proper
road, I probably could've made it in about two days...  
At this point, I changed course. If I keep going down this path, I'll
run into the giant apes.  
I filled the two-liter plastic bottle I brought from the school with
boiled water and cautiously entered the city. I still have some of the
roasted fish left, so I should be able to survive for a few days.  
I say city, but it's more of a town around here. There are quite a few
houses, but many are older buildings, mostly wooden, so most of them
have been reclaimed by nature.  
The fact that the houses are old means that there were probably a lot of
people left behind...  
Looking closely, there are burn marks left where people cooked in the
yards of their houses. They were probably reluctant to leave their old
houses until the very last moment, even after the infrastructure
collapsed.  
Maybe they were attached to this land.  
Maybe they didn't have cars to evacuate.  
Maybe they were sad to leave their familiar homes.  
Maybe they were afraid to move to an unfamiliar place.  
But still... there are no more "people" here.  
  
Without infrastructure, people can't survive in a city.  
There's no food. No water. The remaining supplies will eventually run
out. Even those who stayed until the very end couldn't have kept up that
kind of life forever.  
I don't know what happened to those people.  
But... I can't help but hope they're still alive.  
  
If I don't make any detours, I might be able to reach the commercial
building today.  
My goal is to find a large map showing major roads and stations.  
Also any old newspapers that could give me an idea of what things were
like back then.  
It's better to sneak in at night. That way I can sneak in without being
seen by the apes, but...  
"It's pointless if the giant animals have night vision as good as
mine!"  
  
As I walked, the feel of the city began to change a little.  
I don't know why, but there are more buildings with large, high walls.
The roads around here are wide, so there are lots of weeds, but there
aren't many tall trees.  
Is this a place that miraculously escaped the encroachment of trees?
Trees can't spread without seeds, so in this current world where I
haven't seen pigeons or crows, if there's something like a high wall to
block the path, maybe they don't get overtaken that much.  
While I was wondering if there was another reason, I peeked into the
grounds through a large gate, and saw a place that had relatively short
trees and hadn't been completely swallowed up by them.  
This is...  
"...Ah, a temple."  
I finally understood it after cross-referencing it with my
"knowledge."  
Could all the buildings in this area be temples? Why were there so
many?  
Because the grounds were paved with small stones, or maybe because
they've been compacted, the weeds were sparse and there weren't many
trees. Still, some temples were partially destroyed by tree roots, but
more than half were intact.  
  
Other areas were overgrown with trees, or the towns had become ruins,
but this area retained its original appearance as if it were protected
by a god.  
"Flowers are blooming..."  
I had seen flowers blooming among weeds before, but this is the first
time I think I've seen flowers blooming on trees.  
The flowering trees weren't very big, so maybe trees that don't grow
very big just don't grow out of control.  
It's already evening, and I had decided not to take any detours... but
if it's this beautiful, maybe it would be okay to stay here tonight.  
  
I toured the temple grounds. It feels a little strange how there's not
much of a sense of ruin even though there shouldn't be anyone here.  
Behind the property was a cemetery separated by a fence, and
unfortunately, the trees had encroached from the other side, engulfing
half of the many graves.  
Still, there was a strange scent, maybe the lingering smell of
incense.  
I returned to the temple grounds and walked barefoot on the white
gravel.  
"...Awa."  
It's uncomfortable, but the feeling of it touching the soles of my feet
is kind of nice.  
  
I walked around the area and gathered acorns for tonight's dinner. I
still have a little bit of the roasted fish left, so I'll eat that too.
But I didn't want to dirty this white temple ground, so I went out to
the road and made a fire there.  
Snap…  
The sound of the acorns popping in the milk pot over the campfire echoed
in the night.  
"Haa..."  
I gazed at the stars and satisfied my hunger by eating the hot acorns I
had cracked open with my fingernails.  
I couldn’t get much food, but maybe there are some canned goods left in
the commercial buildings? I'll manage somehow... While thinking that, I
returned to the temple grounds, borrowed the covered veranda, and lay
down on the boards to sleep.  
The next morning—  
  
"...My, my, if it isn't a cute little girl in a place like this."  
  
...Eh?
