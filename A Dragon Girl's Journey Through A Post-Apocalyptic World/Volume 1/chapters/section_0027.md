# 27 Granny's House (8)

***"UboOOOOOOOooooh!!"***  
***"Ugaaaaaaaaa!"***  
The first and a third giant female apes appeared while I was glaring at
the male.  
The third one was showing caution, but the first one was quite angry,
perhaps because she has a strong personality.  
But right now, someone like that doesn't matter to me.  
The giant male ape, whose mate and subordinates had been killed, finally
moved from his position of watching from afar.  
  
***"Ugoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!!!"***  
  
The male ape charged, kicking and smashing through the edge of the
rooftop he was using as a foothold.  
Gaaaaaan!  
My antler spear and the giant male ape's claws clashed. But, I couldn’t
break his claws, and the attack from the seven-meter giant sent me
flying away with ease.  
  
Boom!!  
I smashed through window frames and the equipment inside of some
building, getting embedded further into the wall beyond.  
Several bones were cracked, and red scales were once again covering the
wounds all over my body.  
***"Uhohboooooooooooooooooooooh!!!"***  
The first giant female ape that followed me forced its nearly six-meter
body into the three-meter-high ceiling of the room.  
It probably thought it could overpower me with its strength since I'm so
small compared to them.  
But... the one cornered with no escape is you.  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
I raised my “voice”.  
The giant ape's face distorted as it realized that "heat" was being
infused into my voice.  
  
"――――――――――――――――!!"  
  
My voice turned into an incandescent breath, a beam of heat that
instantly evaporated the surrounding snow as it obliterated the upper
body of the first giant female ape, who had been left with no escape.  
The "Dragon's Breath" that I fired diagonally upwards penetrated several
buildings and carved out the top of the skyscraper I had been using as a
landmark all this time.  
  
Hearing the sound of the building in front of me collapsing after being
hit directly, I devoured the liver of the remaining giant ape, and as I
leaped out of the building, the giant male ape attacked me.  
***"Ugoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"***  
Clang!!  
I received the slammed fist with my antler spear and was blown away
again, but this time, I landed while cracking the outer wall of the
building, and then ran up it vertically by digging my toenails in.  
  
The giant female ape, whose two allies were killed, wore an expression
of rage and single-mindedly chased after me, leaping between
buildings.  
I also changed my trajectory midway, jumping between buildings, and as
we crossed paths, my antler spear gouged the giant male ape's fur, and
its claws scraped my flank.  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
In an instant, scales covered my side, and my full-powered kick and the
giant male ape's fist collided, sending us both flying.  
At that moment—  
  
***"UboOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOh!!"***  
Taking advantage of the opening, the third female ape, who had been
hiding, attacked from behind.  
Crack!!  
***"UboOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOh!?"***  
I evaded its attack with a twist, and the tip of my tail, which had
grown to over a meter long, lashed out like a whip, slicing open the
third ape's face.  
I had noticed its "presence." As I put more strength into my arm, the
redness of my spear intensified. I hurled it with "heat," piercing the
third ape, who was clutching its face, and pinning it to the building
like a specimen.  
Landing on the outer wall of the building, I ran through it, landed
directly on top of the embedded spear, then stabbed into the third ape's
heart with my hand.  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
***"UboOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOh!!"***  
We both screamed, and with my arm stuck up to my shoulder, I grabbed its
heart, tore its blood vessels, and ripped out the enormous heart while
being bathed in a torrent of blood.  
  
While I was devouring the heart I gouged out in front of the convulsing
third body, I received a tremendous impact from directly below and was
kicked upwards into the sky by the giant male ape who had caught up.  
The third ape's corpse and I were sent flying into the air. I was blown
all the way to the skyscraper, and after I climbed up to the destroyed
top floor, the giant male ape caught up.  
I spat out the blood that had accumulated in my mouth and confronted the
giant male ape.  
"...Now it's one-on-one."  
***"...Ugoa"***  
In the gently falling white snowscape...  
My "heat" melted the snow, creating steam that made the air shimmer as I
stood with my bare hands poised with claws outstretched.  
The giant male ape looked at me and bared its fangs, its muscles bulging
all over its body.  
At the highest point in this city, we assumed a forward-leaning stance…
and launched ourselves, simultaneously and without exchanging a word.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
*What is this little creature?*  
The giant male ape was puzzled as he faced the creature.  
When he first noticed it, he thought it was an insignificant little
creature. However, it closely resembled the *hairless apes* that once
claimed this territory, yet its "appearance" somehow evoked a disturbing
premonition, prompting him to deploy his subordinate apes as a
precaution.  
  
On the day the world changed—the giant apes gained freedom.  
He was a “gorilla” who had felt stressed by the confinement, the lack of
anything to do, and the mere acquisition of food. So he grew gigantic,
gained wisdom, and trampled the hairless apes to vent his pent-up
frustration.  
In the same place where other animals had been collected from far away
places, just like himself, several of the other animals had become
gigantic like him, and were freed from their cages.  
There were a few battles with other animals, but not many.  
They were strong from the start, and lived in a group. Besides, the
creatures larger than them were herbivores, and some headed to other
lands without fighting. Most of the carnivores prioritized settling
scores with the hairless apes and using them as "food."  
Battles with the hairless apes resulted in the loss of some of their
group, but ultimately they were able to claim this highest point as
their territory.  
They no longer needed to fear anything. With other kinds of apes,
formerly prey for carnivorous beasts, as their servants, gathering food
in exchange for protection meant they wouldn't starve. They considered
themselves to be at the top of the food chain.  
Then one day, this small creature appeared.  
  
This small red creature radiated an unusual "heat."  
It was a pure, flame-like "heat," different from the hateful "fire" used
by hairless apes to fight giant animals.  
And once the red creature appeared again, the giant male incited the
females to attack it.  
Although it was an unknown opponent, it would be a good toy for his
bored females.  
More than that, he unconsciously thought that he wanted the red
creature, which gave off the feeling of an unknown "something," to
disappear if possible.  
  
But the red creature suddenly showed hostility and killed a female.  
Killing his precious female was unforgivable enough, but the red
creature had the audacity to devour her, of all things.  
That could not be allowed. It shouldn't be allowed.  
There should be no being who preys on his females, who reign supreme in
this ecosystem.  
The red creature grew stronger with each thing it devoured, increasing
its "heat".  
Now it was fighting him on equal footing, trying to take something more
from him.  
He would absolutely not forgive such an insolent existence.  
  
No matter how many times it was punched, clawed, and smashed with his
enormous arms, it would always rise again and kick back with equal
force, proving just how much strength its small body possessed.  
The giant male ape transformed the unknown "something" he felt into
rage, and roared fiercely.  
But the red creature returned a roar like “thunder” that shook the
heavens, baring its fangs and glaring at him with its golden eyes with
narrowed slits.  
At that moment, the giant male ape understood.  
The unknown "something" he felt from this creature…  
It was "fear."  
This was not just a small creature.  
This creature… was a "predator" of all giant creatures, including
himself.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
***"――Ugoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
  
The giant male ape suddenly lunged, like a beast reverting to its primal
instincts, without any defense, biting into my shoulder.  
Its enormous fangs sunk in, trying to tear me apart.  
However, at that moment, the area around the embedded fangs was covered
with red scales, and as the fangs were gradually pushed back, a look of
despair appeared on the giant male ape's face.  
"Uoooooooooooooooooah!!"  
I also bit into the giant ape's neck, tearing through its carotid artery
along with the flesh.  
Bathed in the gushing blood, I thrust my red-clawed hand into that
wound, tearing it open, and continued to devour the flesh until its life
was exhausted.
