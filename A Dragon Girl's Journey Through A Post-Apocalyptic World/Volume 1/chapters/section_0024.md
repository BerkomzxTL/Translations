# 24 Granny's House (5)

“……Granny, aren’t you cold?”  
“I’m fine thanks to you bringing plenty of charcoal.”  
As Granny lay down in her futon, she stroked my head as I peered at her
from beside the pillow.  
Granny has a cold. She said she’d come down with it because of the
sudden chill lately.  
I… was too insensitive to the cold to notice sooner. If I had been more
thoughtful, I would’ve done all the outside work myself… I felt
regret.  
Granny had spent many winters here, so she said she was just a little
tired and would be alright, but the world has gotten colder and colder
each year since everyone disappeared.  
  
I added more charcoal to the brazier in the room, put the grill on top,
and placed the kettle on it.  
I need to keep the room as warm as possible, but I also need to
ventilate because of the fire. But the snow outside hasn't stopped
falling since earlier, and the temperature has dropped so much that the
last vestiges of autumn have vanished.  
"You all seem energetic, huh."  
  
—Cluck—  
  
As the snow fell, I popped my head into the chicken coop—actually a
storage shed that Gramps modified—in the giant tree forest, and the
chickens came rushing over.  
Apparently, this shed was here from the beginning and somehow escaped
being consumed by the giant trees. Thanks to them, no snow accumulated
here, so even in this frigid air, the chickens were energetically
pecking at the ground, searching for insects under the fallen leaves.  
I scattered the leftover scraps from our meals and the millet and weeds
I pulled while weeding the garden during the summer, and the chickens
immediately started pecking at them.  
“Ah, there’s something today. I’ll take some~”  
  
—Cluck—  
  
…Do they understand what I’m saying?  
After that, I gathered the leeks and ginger that were buried in the
snow, washed them in the well, got the firewood I split during the
autumn, dug out the hearth which was half-buried in snow, even though it
was under the eaves, and started a fire.  
In the kitchen, I chopped the leeks and ginger as Granny taught me, and
while it was snowing, I simmered kelp in water in a clay pot, removing
it before boiling. Then I added the rice that had been soaking in water
and the ginger, and started cooking it with extra water.  
Without even minding the snow accumulating on my head and tail, I
adjusted the heat to prevent it from boiling over.  
Even though I’m exposing my skin to the snow and walking on the snow
with bare feet, I’m not cold at all.  
But Granny… a human… easily fell ill from these changes in
temperature.  
"... I think I managed it."  
Finally, I added the egg and chopped leeks and cooked them with the
residual heat. I put Granny’s homemade pickled plums and miso paste in a
small bowl and took the clay pot to Granny.  
“Granny, the rice porridge is ready.”  
Egg porridge with leeks and ginger. It might be wrong since it’s my
first time making it alone, but I did taste it, so it's probably fine.  
  
“……Sorry to trouble you. But you don’t have to make rice porridge every
day, you know?”  
“No way. You need to eat properly and get better.”  
Granny was hesitant about having rice porridge every day due to the
limited amount of rice.  
“……Are you eating properly, young lady?”  
“I can eat anything, so I’m fine!”  
Rather than thinking about herself, she kept asking me if I was eating
properly every day.  
  
It’s been three days since Granny caught a cold. Granny said that winter
came early this year. She apparently caught it due to the sudden
temperature change.  
During that time, I caught fish for Granny’s nutrition, and looked for
mushrooms and wild vegetables, but her appetite was getting smaller and
smaller each day.  
Probably, she lacks vitamins. It would be nice if there were fruits, but
there aren't any nearby. If I'd gone up to the mountains, I might have
found kumquats, but I wasted time thinking it was still autumn.  
Dried persimmons would be good, but they weren't ready yet.  
“I wonder if Jinbei will be alright in the snow…”  
Jinbei, a hardy Japanese dog who used to sleep outside in the doghouse
even in winter, seemed like the kind to run around in the snow.  
  
My meals are really okay even if they're just anything. I gave the fish
meat to Granny and ate everything else by roasting the head and bones.  
I also visited the temple I stopped by before and got all the canned
peaches.  
I brought back other soups and nutritious canned goods that Granny might
eat, but she didn't eat much.  
The next day, and the day after that, Granny's condition didn't improve,
and as I began to feel anxious about Granny’s slowly weakening
“presence” … I suddenly remembered.  
  
“Granny, didn’t you say you used to go to the hospital? Were you taking
any medicine?”  
“……I had a lot back then.”  
Even at that time, Granny, who was eighty years old, apparently took
many medications for blood pressure, blood clot prevention, and internal
organs, though she didn’t have any serious problems.  
She had so much that she sometimes skipped days when she felt well, and
sometimes forgot to take them altogether, so she ended up with a lot of
medicine left over.  
Since she had several years’ worth of medicine left, she only took
medication when she felt unwell, even when she started staying here.  
But after Gramps passed away, Granny’s health deteriorated, and she
started taking more, and the large amount of medicine she had eventually
ran out.  
  
“This drawer?”  
“……Yes.”  
Following Granny’s instructions, I opened a drawer in the dresser in the
living room, and found empty pill packaging. There were five types I
needed. Internal organ medicine in particular. And I also want fever
reducers.  
There might be a pharmacy around here. But I don't know if I can find
all the medicine there. I can't even tell the difference between drugs
with the same effect.  
Therefore, I need to go to the hospital where Granny used to go, where
they should have the same medicine.  
That place is…  
“……That hospital I stopped by before.”  
  
That hospital where I encountered the group of giant apes and ran
away.  
Of course, if I’m found, I’ll have to fight four giant apes.  
As I was about to get up from beside Granny’s pillow after making her
porridge, her thin hand grasped my fur clothing.  
  
"...You don't have to go. That place is dangerous, you know. There's a
big ape there..."  
“Yeah, I know.”  
It’s nice that you’re worried about me… but I hate it.  
I absolutely hate the thought of Granny being in trouble while I do
nothing.  
I gently removed Granny’s hand and smiled.  
“It’ll be okay. I’ll sneak in and out.”  
“……Come back right away if it gets dangerous.”  
“Got it.”  
I left some water by Granny’s pillow, added charcoal to the brazier and
water to the kettle, and softly murmured, *I’m off,* to Granny, who had
fallen asleep again, as I left the room.  
  
“……Let’s go.”  
All I’m taking is the antler spear. It’s better to be as light as
possible.  
I slapped my cheek once to psych myself up and ran out into the snow.  
  
The snow hasn't stopped falling since that day.  
It wasn't a blizzard, but snow continued to blanket the fallen leaves
and weeds that covered the road, and I, fiery red, dashed through the
pure white town where snow fell silently.  
I could see the high-rise building in the distance even in the snow, so
I won't get lost. But if I go straight there, I'm more likely to run
into the giant apes, so I detoured, heading towards the river, just like
before.  
Day turned to night, and the temperature seemed to have dropped even
further.  
I'm in a hurry. That anxiety turned into "heat," and my legs sped up.  
Because those giant apes had claimed the area around the building as
their territory, the solitary giant animals in this area had
disappeared, and as a result, Granny was safe. But now, those giant apes
are the biggest obstacle.  
  
After more than an hour of detours, I felt no nostalgia as I finally
caught a glimpse of that abandoned hospital through the gaps in the
trees.  
Where should I enter? Destroying the tree roots covering the first floor
will take time, so I have no choice but to enter from above as before.  
I couldn’t feel the "presence" of those giant apes. I exhaled lightly to
relax my tension, and just as I was looking for a big tree I could
climb―  
  
—Ooh, hohohho—  
  
I heard the cry of an ape nearby, and when I turned around, I saw a
normal-sized ape looking at me and howling from a large tree near the
hospital.  
“—!”  
I’ve been found! To silence the ape, I raised my antler spear high to
throw it.  
  
Kiiiiiiiii!!  
  
However, soon after, apes appeared one after another as if they had been
called.  
This is bad! If a commotion starts here and the giant apes appear, the
hospital might be destroyed, and the medicine might get buried under the
rubble.  
I immediately ran away from the abandoned hospital.  
Why were the apes here? Is this also their territory?  
Or… could it be that because I visited last time, the giant apes are on
guard and had sent lookouts?  
  
As if to obstruct my actions, dozens of apes, I don’t know where they
came from, howled from the trees and attacked me.  
Even a mere ape, if it's a larger individual, is said to have grip
strength that exceeds that of a human.  
Even though each one alone isn't a big deal, if countless apes attach
themselves to me, it’ll be troublesome.  
“Get out of my…”  
I glared at the howling apes, and my hands gripping the antler spear
became enveloped in bright red scales.  
“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy!!”  
  
In a flash—I swung the antler spear sideways, blowing away the apes that
were trying to block my way, slamming them into the trees and
buildings.  
Now the way is clear. I just need to lure them somewhere and then return
to the hospital.  
But at that moment, a piercing gaze and a strong "presence" stopped me
in my tracks.  
  
***"UhooOOOooo…"***  
  
A giant ape watching me from atop a building.  
I was trying to leave the abandoned hospital, but I had unknowingly been
lured into the giant ape's territory.
