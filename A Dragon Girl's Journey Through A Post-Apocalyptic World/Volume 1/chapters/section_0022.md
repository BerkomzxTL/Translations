# 22 Granny's House (3)

"One hundred and fifty-four... You're so small, young lady."  
"Even though you’re the one who’s smaller!?"  
Cluck! A chicken chimed in with my exclamation.  
  
Two weeks have passed since I came to Granny's house.  
Initially, I planned to finish the work Granny couldn't do, explore the
commercial building, and then leave. But Granny kept cooking meals for
me, so I felt bad about just freeloading, so I ended up doing more and
more.  
I went to the river to catch fish, collected persimmons and chestnuts
from the gardens of the large houses, and searched the abandoned stores
for canned goods and alcohol. ...Well, most of the persimmons around
here were bitter.  
"You can make sweets."  
And she gently stroked my head...  
While I was living that life, Granny measured my height against a
pillar. I thought I’d be a little taller, though...  
  
Also, the large map I was looking for was at Granny's house, so I found
it easily.  
This is the area around here. The evacuation was to the "South".  
  
But Granny didn't know exactly where the evacuation destination was, so
I still ended up having to search through commercial buildings to find
newspapers from that time and the latest information.  
  
"The young lady’s hair is cherry blossom-colored, and your skin is
reddish-bronze. They're both quite pale, though."  
Granny remarked while combing my hair, describing my reddish-silver hair
and reddish-tan skin.  
"Then, I'm off~!"  
"Alright, have a good time."  
Granny saw me off, and I began today's work. First, I need to collect
the things that have been depleted because of me.  
When Granny and Gramps decided to stay here, most of the neighbors chose
to evacuate. But the local temple owner was apparently worried about the
two of them and entrusted them with the keys to the temple.  
The places storing daily necessities and food, like stores, were
obviously looted by people who came from elsewhere while evacuating. But
places like temples were hardly ransacked, maybe out of a sense of
taboo.  
There's the aspect of it being sacrilegious, but even desperate people
didn't vandalize them, probably because they never expected the temples
to have any food.  
I didn't think there would be food at the temples either, so I excluded
them from my search.  
  
"Excuse me~"  
The first place I went to was the temple a few houses away.  
The area was almost completely covered by trees, but the main hall was
still intact.  
As I was told, I went around to the back, unlocked the door, and went
inside. It was dusty, but it didn't feel like an abandoned building.  
I went further in and looked for a room with a dresser and a small
storage case. I'd gotten the general location from Granny, but after
searching for about thirty minutes, I finally found what I was looking
for.  
"Found it… Koji starter…"  
It says so on the bag, so I'm sure.  
Granny grows a small amount of rice and soybeans, and she can apparently
also make koji, which is the base for miso and soy sauce, but she can't
make the koji starter.  
The wife of the temple owner here was also someone who made miso at
home, just like Granny.  
Granny's house still has miso from ten years ago in a barrel, but since
she’s been making a little bit each year, the koji starter has started
running low, so I came to look for it.  
  
I've accomplished my main objective, but my purpose in coming to the
temple isn't over yet. When I went further in, there were more than ten
boxes stacked there.  
These are the *gifts* and *gratitudes*, New Year's and Summer gifts,
that the temple received.  
They received a lot of food, but couldn't consume it all, so they
divided it among parishioners and neighbors, but before they could, the
disaster caused by the giant animals happened, and they had to
evacuate.  
"…………"  
I gently touched a yellowed paper stuck to the wall.  
It recorded the date, time, and what they received in elegant writing.  
I think for the first few years it was written in Grandpa's handwriting.
Several years ago, it became Granny's writing, and around two years ago,
it stopped.  
From around that time, she was no longer able to carry heavy things...  
  
"Now then, which one?"  
Changing my mood, I searched for what I needed. Judging from the
attached memo, there must have been ten times this much at first.
Grandpa collected the dried noodles that were prone to mold, and
perishable vacuum-packed goods early on, so all that was left were the
canned items.  
Granny said I could take whatever I liked, and as I followed her note, I
found a can of salad oil.  
"Okay, next!"  
Then I went on to visit other temples.  
I need salad oil, sugar, salt, and stock. And sake and shochu.  
The sake isn't for drinking, it's for cooking, and the shochu can be
used as a disinfectant, but it was specifically mentioned because it's
needed for making dried persimmons.  
My bad, Granny. I'm sorry.  
At the second temple, I got salt and sugar... but why is this sugar in a
pack shaped like a sea bream¹?  
And at the fourth temple, I found sake and shochu. ...Or rather, was
this priest a big drinker? Besides sake and shochu, there's a lot of
whiskey and other liquors...  
I also found dashi stock in the kitchen there. The dried sardines were
gone in the first few years, but I was able to find dried bonito flakes
and powdered dashi stock when I went out of my way to look for them.  
  
"I found some…"  
And also, I skipped the third place, but instead of finding what I was
looking for, there were a lot of canned goods, and I ended up taking
some canned peaches. Taking them all would feel lonely, so I only took
three.  
There were also cans of curry and soup, so I took one of each. Would
Granny like them? If she does, I'll come back and get some more.  
"...Alright, that's it."  
I wrote down what I got on the memo pad on the wall. Now, Granny can no
longer remember the date or day of the week, so I wrote it down
meticulously in her stead.  
...Come to think of it, I’m able to write characters, huh.  
  
But still…  
"...I haven't seen any rats or anything."  
I vaguely understand that the medium-sized animals decreased drastically
due to being preyed upon by giant animals.  
I still see small birds, so I understand why there are fewer insects.  
But why aren't rats swarming the city even though their predators are
gone? It wouldn’t be strange if they were overpopulated…  
  
"Because it's cold."  
"...Eh?"  
It’s freezing… Granny told me that it’s been getting colder.  
"There were a lot in the beginning..."  
To sum up Granny's long story, it seems that many rats came targeting
the fields the year after people left. A lot of insects also appeared,
but by the following year they were almost all gone.  
Before the giant animals appeared, it was so warm that it rarely snowed
even in winter, but suddenly, it became as cold as when Granny was a
child.  
When the winters suddenly became incredibly cold, small urban creatures
like rats, accustomed to warmth and plenty of food, couldn’t withstand
the sudden change and most of them disappeared.  
Did the environment get better because people disappeared? ...No,
they've been here for a long time, so is it really normal for their
numbers to decrease so suddenly?  
Just like with the giant animals, it seemed like there was some cause to
the things that increased and decreased.  
Even so...it's amazing that not only Granny, but the chickens and Jinbei
have all stayed safe in the cold weather.  
  
At night, she lights candles and I listen to Granny's stories.  
Stories of the past, about Gramps, about her great-grandchildren, and
about the neighbors.  
She talks about various things, such as how to cultivate fields and what
can be harvested around here.  
Apparently there are a lot of candles because there are many temples
around here. Even so, Granny seems to sleep when it gets dark and wakes
up with the sunrise, but she lights candles for me so we could talk.  
Granny and I talk until one candle burns out, then we go to bed.  
  
I've been sleeping in the same room as Granny. But I can't stand cloth
bedding, so I sleep lying on the tatami mat, but Granny covers me with a
towel blanket when she wakes up in the middle of the night.  
"...Ugh"  
"...Aren't you cold?"  
"I'm really not cold!"  
I might seem cold to Granny who’s sleeping in a futon, but because I
have "heat" inside my body, I don’t feel cold at all.  
"It's getting colder, you know."  
"I see..."  
  
There's a lot to do tomorrow as well.  
Weeding the fields, using charcoal as insect repellent. Maybe I should
make charcoal too.  
Cleaning the roof and water tank, maintaining the graves. I should look
for incense sticks somewhere.  
I also need to chop wood, and I need to find some fallen trees that can
be used as firewood.  
Maybe I should go to the river and catch some fish...  
I want to finish everything that Granny couldn't do because Gramps was
gone.  
I was planning to leave soon...  
  
And so time passed… and the season was turning to winter.
