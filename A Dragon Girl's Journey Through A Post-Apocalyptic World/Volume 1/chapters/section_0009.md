# 9 Jinbei's Farm (4)

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"  
A scream escaped my lips from the intense pain.  
The giant boar that suddenly attacked Jinbei. I managed to shove Jinbei
out of the way of its approaching tusks, but they pierced my stomach and
thigh.  
  
Was this field targeted by this boar?  
Is that why Jinbei was so wary when I first came here?  
***"BoooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"***  
The giant boar tossed me around like I was a bothersome twig, flinging
my body into the air.  
"Gaha!"  
Blood leaked from my mouth. With each toss, intense pain assaulted me.  
That “pain” ignited the fighting spirit within me, and as I screamed, as
if to release the overflowing “heat,” I stabbed my antler spear with all
my might into the giant boar's eye.  
***"BmuOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"***  
  
With what was likely the first painful blow it had ever received, the
huge boar continued to rampage while I was still impaled.  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
***"BmuOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
It was too big; the spear couldn't reach its brain. My feet were off the
ground, so I couldn't put in much strength. I dug my claws into its tusk
with one hand to prevent it from piercing through completely, enduring
the pain as if my body were about to be torn apart, and kicked it
between the eyes with my heel.  
  
Dogon!!  
  
With a loud thud, the giant boar's head caved in, and the recoil flung
me away from it.  
***"BmuOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO…………"***  
The huge boar staggered while glaring at me with its remaining eye as I
rolled across the field… but as its body swayed further, it turned its
back and disappeared into the forest, breaking trees as it went.  
“……It…ran away?”  
  
Bau bau!  
  
"Jin…bei…"  
At that sound, my fading consciousness resurfaced. Jinbei, who had
returned, desperately licked my blood-soaked face as I lay on my back in
the field, bringing me back to my senses.  
“……Safe?”  
  
Kyuuun….  
  
I gently stroked Jinbei's neck as he licked me. Jinbei's face looked
distorted in my eyes, and my vision blurred. Not good… I'm losing too
much blood.  
I need to eat something immediately.  
"Jinbei…"  
My vision turned red. Every living thing looked like food.  
――Gac!  
  
Kyan!?  
  
"Sorry, Jinbei…water channel…which way?"  
Jinbei seemed surprised when I suddenly hit myself in the head, but
right now I have to get to a place where I could definitely eat
“meat.”  
Blood spilled endlessly from my stomach and legs, and my vision was
becoming increasingly crimson.  
I could barely see anymore. Forcibly clinging to my hazy consciousness
using the pain, I stood up using the antler spear as a walking stick,
while Jinbei watched me with teary eyes.  
"Please,*water* …*water channel* …which way?"  
  
Bau!  
  
It seems that Jinbei finally understood the “words” I uttered, and he
barked as if to lead the way for me.  
“……Gofu”  
My internal organs are probably damaged too. With every step, blood
spurted from my stomach and legs, and blood also dripped from my
mouth.  
Even a few dozen meters seems so far…  
Dragging myself along, I reached the water channel after what felt like
an eternity, and collapsed with my upper body hanging over the edge…  
Gashi…  
I caught a large crayfish and crushed it alive with my fangs.  
  
Kyuuun….  
  
Crack, shatter, snap...  
Only the sounds of me crushing and eating the crayfish, shell and all,
echoed in the midnight water channel.  
Not just crayfish, but large shellfish and what looked like a turtle
hidden at the bottom—everything I touched, I put in my mouth and crushed
it with my fangs.  
Whether it was alive or covered in mud didn't matter. I simply preyed on
living things to satisfy my “hunger”.  
Vegetables won't do…I need “meat”.  
The water channel has few predators, so even though we had caught a lot
of crayfish and shellfish the day before, within a night new ones had
surged back in.  
  
Bau bau!  
  
"Jinbei…"  
Jinbei caught a big frog from somewhere.  
I took it and tore it apart with my claws, biting into it, and similarly
devoured what looked like a soft-shelled turtle, which Jinbei had also
brought.  
  
“……Tsuu…”  
As dawn approached, a violent stomach ache hit me. Of course, since I
was eating these things raw and unwashed. There must have been poisonous
creatures mixed in among them… but I ignored it and continued to eat
living things while drenched in sweat.  
“……!”  
After a while, I felt a “heat” around my abdomen, and the abdominal pain
suddenly disappeared.  
“……Cough, cough!”  
At the same time, an overwhelming urge to vomit came over me, and as I
leaned on the ground and coughed violently, a black, lump-like substance
fell from my mouth with a splat, and suddenly the discomfort vanished.  
  
This is…probably the toxins and mud from what I had eaten, things my
body doesn’t need.  
My stomach and internal organs were strengthened by that "heat,"
allowing me to digest most things, and things I still didn't need were
expelled in this way.  
I've become less human again… but it's helping me now.  
"Cough…I'm okay now, Jinbei"  
  
Bau….  
  
The pain in my body had mostly disappeared, and Jinbei approached and
licked my cheek, sensing that I had calmed down now that the intense
feeling of hunger was gone.  
"Thanks... sorry for worrying you."  
The crisis was over. But even after preying on over a hundred crayfish
and other creatures from the waterway overnight, the injuries I
sustained were not completely healed.  
When I touched the deep gash in my stomach, I felt a hard texture
against my fingers.  
The wound was covered with blood-red scales. If it’s the same as with
the giant deer, the scales should come off once the wound heals, but I
could sense that this won't heal immediately.  
It probably has to do with the quality of the meat rather than the
quantity I ate.  
But I can't wait until the wound heals completely…  
"That thing…will definitely come back."  
  
That giant boar must need a lot of food to maintain its enormous size.
But why didn't it devour all the crops in the field last time?  
It's just a guess, but it probably learned to obtain food regularly by
moving between multiple areas instead of staying in one place and
devouring all the food in that area.  
It must have been several years, or perhaps several months, since it
last appeared here... Last night, it panicked from the unexpected pain
and ran away, but it’ll be back here soon.  
The giant deer also seemed to have higher intelligence than normal
animals, perhaps due to its size.  
Animals have feelings too. If it’s intelligent, rather than fearing a
small opponent who injured it, it’ll prioritize its emotions and seek
revenge.  
The giant boar's “eyes” said as much in the end.  
  
I returned home with Jinbei. I had eaten all the creatures in this part
of the water channel, so I can't catch any more today, but I wish I
could eat something more…  
…I felt like eating something warm. Preferably human food.  
I washed the leftover shells and bones thoroughly, boiled them lightly
to remove impurities and dirt, and simmered them slowly to make stock.  
I harvested vegetables from the home garden, simmered potatoes,
soybeans, and cabbage together, portioned some out for Jinbei, then
added a massive amount of salt and ate a large pot full of boiled
vegetables to replenish my energy.  
My stomach and legs still feel a little stiff, but I can tolerate the
slight pain.  
My body’s still covered in mud, but it doesn't matter. To face the giant
boar that’s sure to come again, I gripped my antler spear tightly,
raising even the “heat” of my body's wounds, and struck the ground with
the butt of the spear.  
  
"Let's do it, Jinbei."  
Bau!
