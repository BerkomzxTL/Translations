# 25 Granny's House (6)

Approximately six meters tall… Thick muscles on a thick bone structure,
covered in black fur.  
The giant form before me matches my “knowledge.”  
This isn’t just a typical giant ape. This is… a mountain gorilla!  
  
***"UboOOOOOOOooooooooo!"***  
  
An enormous ape clinging to a building howls towards the heavens, its
cry echoing as if from afar.  
  
“—!”  
Realizing it called for reinforcements, I immediately tried to run
away.  
BAKIYIIIIIN!!  
But at that moment, the giant ape kicked off the building's exterior
wall, shattering the windows as it leaped towards me.  
I immediately dodged to the side, and as the ape landed, it sent a huge
plume of snow flying. Its claws gouged the asphalt. A large shadow
emerged from the swirling snow, and I instinctively raised my
spear—but.  
“—!?”  
I hastily intercepted a car, presumably thrown at me, with my spear.  
“UaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!”  
The bright red scales covering my arms extended to my biceps as I
yelled, deflecting the car to the side.  
KIIIIIIIIII!!  
  
Countless apes took advantage of the opportunity to attack.  
I blocked the fangs of an ape biting at me with the scales on my arms,
and punched the apes that came after me one after another.  
Why were these apes attacking? They’re different from the mountain
gorilla; they should be different species!  
“—!”  
***"UboAAAAAAAaaaaaaaa!"***  
The moment I was distracted by the ordinary apes, the giant ape, using a
car as a shield, came charging at me out of the snow and slammed its
fist into my small body.  
BOOM!!  
"Kuhaah!"  
The air in my lungs was expelled. I was sent flying tens of meters,
smashing through a signpost and crashing into a giant tree.  
  
“...cough”  
It’s much stronger than I expected. Even though I've fought a giant deer
and giant boar, and have become quite strong, I can't even fight it
properly.  
***"UhohhoOoooooo!"***  
The giant ape roared, and the ordinary apes attacked me as I lay
there.  
Using the scales on my arm, I blocked the ape's claws and fangs,
deflected them with my antler spear, and kicked them away. Then, seeing
that the giant ape was lifting up another wrecked kei truck, I hurriedly
leaped out of the forest of giant trees, and at the same time, it was
thrown in, engulfing the apes that were too late in escaping.  
“Kuh”  
***"Hooh!"***  
The giant ape was grinning cruelly, toying with its prey.  
  
As expected, the giant ape was not only strong but also quite
intelligent.  
Among the ordinary apes, there were a few chimpanzees and apes not
native to this country. They’re probably the animals that Granny
mentioned escaped from the zoo.  
I imagine that the smaller animals in the zoo were mostly eaten by the
larger carnivorous ones. The giant ape protected the ordinary apes from
them, keeping them under its control.  
  
However, the apes don’t seem to be forced into submission.  
For the apes, being under its protection allows them to safely gather
food and survive.  
Even though some apes were caught in the giant ape's earlier attack,
perhaps because they have higher intelligence than other animals, they
seem to have a sense of “superiority” to being in the giant ape's group,
showing a distorted expression that prioritizes their own “pleasure”
over their dead comrades.  
KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!  
  
Swarms of apes came at me and started throwing stones, aiming for my
back and legs while avoiding my scaly arms.  
“—!”  
As I dodged the apes, the giant ape attacked again.  
***"UgoaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"***  
The apes lured me out from a narrow space to a wider one. While dodging
the ordinary apes, I ran through the snow to search for a place where I
could fight the giant ape one-on-one.  
But—  
“—!?”  
A gigantic shadow appeared from around the corner of a building.  
“Another one!?”  
***"UboOOOOOOOooooooooo!"***  
As if it had been lying in wait for me, another giant ape appeared,
blowing away the piled-up snow along with wrecked cars as it approached,
swinging its massive arms and claws.  
Crash!!  
"Guh!"  
I tried to quickly block the blow by crossing my arms, but I was sent
flying over ten meters.  
The supposedly tough red scales were torn apart, and blood spurted out.
Having been blown away multiple times, my back and legs were also
injured, and the dripping blood dyed the white snow red.  
  
“These guys…!”  
There's no time. I really need to get back quickly!  
“Get out of my wayYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!”  
The “rage” inside of me ignited and turned into a “heat” that coursed
through my body.  
BOOM!!  
My legs, filled with “heat”, propelled me forward, sending up a spray of
snow as I lunged at the second giant ape with my spear.  
***"UhoOo!?"***  
The giant ape quickly blocked it with its arm, tightened its muscles,
and swung me around with the spear still embedded.  
With a "crack" from my feet, I kicked the giant ape in the side of its
face with all my might with my legs covered in bright red scales.  
***"GoaAAAAAAAAAAAA!"***  
With a sound like rocks crashing together, the giant ape was sent
sprawling, raising a cloud of snow.  
Being so light, the recoil sent me flying, and the first giant ape
leaped at me.  
***"UboOOOOOOOooooooooo!"***  
“Thiiiiiiiiss!!”  
  
BOOM!!  
  
The giant ape's fist and my kick collided.  
The scales on my leg peeled off, and the fur on the giant ape's fist
tore. Even as we both bled, I moved quickly and pierced the giant ape's
shoulder with my spear.  
***"UgoaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"***  
  
But the ape ignored it and kicked me, sending me flying through the snow
and asphalt.  
“Kaha!”  
Blood leaked from my mouth. Together with snow and branches, I was
kicked by the giant ape that was nearly six meters tall, and my body was
sent flying above the trees for over ten meters, breaking through giant
trees along the way.  
And there—  
  
***"UgiIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!"***  
A giant ape clinging to a building attacked.  
“A third one!”  
BAAAAANG!!  
I hastily blocked its powerful claw attack with my spear and arms, but
my arm scales shattered, and I was sent flying, spraying blood, and
crashing into the exterior wall of the building.  
“Guu…”  
To cling to consciousness, and to avoid falling to the apes armed with
stones waiting below, I dug my claws into the building’s wall, grasping
onto the vines growing there.  
  
***"UgiIIIIIIIIII…"***  
The third giant ape, having missed its chance to kill me, was howling
and baring its teeth menacingly from the opposite building.  
***"Uho HooooOooooooooo!"***  
***"Ugaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"***  
At that moment, the first and second giant apes climb up the walls of
the buildings on either side, flanking me.  
I'm completely surrounded. I guess they were waiting for me after all.  
“Uuuuuuuuuuuuuu!”  
I also bared my fangs and threatened the three giant apes.  
…These guys, all three are female. But why aren't they attacking right
away? If they attacked at once, these intelligent creatures should know
that there's nothing I could do. Besides...  
“Where’s the male?”  
At that moment—  
A chill ran down my spine, and when I looked up at the building, the
giant ape, seemingly the "male" leader of the group I first saw above
that hospital, was looking down at me.  
  
I… have been cornered on top of this building with no way to escape, and
it hit me that I’ve fallen right into their trap.
