# 1 Waking Up To A Post-Apocalyptic World

**Volume 1: A World Without People**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

――Born from a "wish"――  
  
A "voice" heard from afar.  
A "light" visible in a hazy, drowsy darkness.  
I feel like I've been sleeping forever. I also feel like I've been
walking forever.  
Little by little...just little by little over a long period of time, "I"
awakened my consciousness.  
As I awakened, a sense of self and… a feeling of anxiety arose. Driven
by that feeling, "I" moved toward the "light" in the darkness.  
I simply moved forward, reaching for the unreachable "light."  
But I was hindered by something invisible, and driven by mounting
frustration, "I" violently shattered my "shell."  
  
BAKIYIIIN!  
  
“…Uuuuuuuuuuugh…”  
A faint air current touched my skin… The faintly unpleasant smell of
dust.  
Surrounded by darkness and faint light. Ignoring all of this, I let out
a groaning sound due to the intense hunger gnawing at my body.
Unconsciously, "I" bit into the only organic-looking thing that tickled
my nostrils.  
Crunch… Crunch… It shattered against my fangs, making a sound unlike any
food, and disappeared into my stomach.  
In the darkness where only that sound echoed, the "meal" continued,
solely to satisfy my hunger…  
  
“…Fuuh”  
After exhaling, and the instinctive anxiety of "hunger" having been
somewhat satisfied, "I" finally had the leeway to look around.  
“…Where… am I?”  
A slight incongruity… Is this "my” "voice"? Looking around, I realized
that this was a private hospital room, but…  
“‘Hospital’… what? Ah, right… a *‘hospital’*."  
  
An unfamiliar "word" appeared in my head. And looking at the room again,
I was able to understand that this is a *‘hospital room’*, by comparing
the "reality" with my "knowledge."  
An unfamiliar place. An incomprehensible situation. In the midst of not
knowing anything, a great question crossed my mind.  
“…Who… am ‘I’…?”  
  
I have no memory of who "I" am. I can't remember my name or my family.  
I can't remember any memories from my life up to this point, nor why I
ended up in this place.  
Hmm, something is… different? I don't mean I can't remember… I just
don't know?  
I can think, but I don't know the source of that "knowledge." In the
anxiety of not knowing anything, I tried to stand up, putting strength
into my legs, but my feet wobbled as if I was losing my balance.  
“…Is it because I’ve been sleeping for a long time that I don’t know
anything?”  
Despite that, I don't feel like my muscles are atrophied. But my center
of gravity feels off, making me sway back and forth.  
  
“This is…”  
What I inadvertently touched as I stumbled was something like a capsule.
But half of it is crushed, so maybe this is what I was eating? And…  
“It’s so dark, how can I see…?”  
There’s almost no light in the darkness. But I could understand that
it’s a room like a hospital room, and that the thing I touched is a
capsule; I can even make out its shape.  
In that darkness, I realized that something that looked faintly like a
"line" was light leaking from the gap in the door.  
Yes… a *‘door.’* Matching it with my "knowledge" within myself, I
understood that it’s the entrance to this room. Believing that the
"light" I saw in my dream was that, I clung to it. Grab――  
“…It won’t open? Why…? Cough…”  
Perhaps because of my sudden movement, I inhaled some dust that had
stirred up and choked. Looking closely around the room, I noticed that
the floor was covered in dust, enough to leave traces of where I had
wandered, showing how long I had been asleep.  
Despite that, for some reason, my naked body feels damp, which feels
unnatural.  
  
“What’s going on…? Someone!”  
I shouted toward the outside through the gap in the door. But no one
answered.  
Am I trapped here? Can I never get out? What if there really is no one
here...?  
Again overcome by a sense of impatience, I put my hand on the door. I
put all my strength into it, but the door, which doesn’t even have a
doorknob and only has a small panel, only creaked slightly and didn't
open.  
“\~\~~!”  
Still, I put strength into my hands. Regardless of the pain in my
fingertips and nails, I continued to apply force, and suddenly, "heat"
was generated in my arms and fingers.  
――Gakin!  
“Waa?!”  
With a sound like metal twisting, the door swung open.  
“Oww…”  
I tumbled out of the room with that momentum and squinted at the sudden
bright light, and as I touched my sore butt and head where I had been
hit…  
“Eh? What? A tail?!”  
There was something like a "tail" right above my butt. It’s about the
thickness of a finger and about fifteen centimeters long, but it looks
exactly like a tail. Not only that, but I also have bright red claws,
like those of a bird or reptile, on my fingertips that hadn't been there
until a moment ago. And…  
“I even have ‘horns’…”  
Small "horns" had grown from above my ears, near the sides of my head.  
  
“What is this…”  
Stunned, I looked down at my body and saw reddish-tan skin and small
breasts.  
Looking back, I see that I am a woman. I have no memory of my age, but
since my arms and legs are still thin, I might still be young.  
…Why don't I even remember my own gender?  
Moreover, to be left naked like this… what's really going on?  
And――  
“That light…”  
  
The room where "I" was sleeping was at the far end of a straight
corridor. A strong light was coming from the very end of that
corridor.  
A long, pure white corridor… but the white walls and ceiling are
yellowish and grimy, and as if no one had been there for years, there
was not a single footprint on the floor, only thick layers of dust.  
There are no other rooms on either side of the corridor, instead there’s
an iron-barred door that had been left wide open.  
That "light" beyond that…  
“…It must be outside!”  
I ran down the dusty corridor where no one had walked for years.  
I'm sure I can get out. If I go outside, I'm sure there'll be someone
there… Such thoughts made my legs move faster.  
  
“…Ah”  
At the end of the corridor, there was another curved corridor, one side
of which was entirely window glass.  
But, instead of the "answer" I had hoped for, outside the grimy window
glass all I could see were trees obscuring the view.  
“…What’s really going on!?”  
Failing to find a clue to understand the situation, I ran down the white
corridor again.  
I ran through the corridor where dust had accumulated and pens and
objects were scattered, not even concerned about injuring my bare feet,
and jumped down the stairs I found.  
I just want to get outside at all costs. If I go outside, I'm sure I'll
find something… Driven by such thoughts, I blindly searched for an exit.
The corridor to there, and the scenery visible from the window, are the
same as before; it seems to be abandoned, and there wasn't a single
person in sight.  
  
Reaching the bottom, I finally found what looked like a reception
lobby.  
A wide space large enough to fit a house, with a large reception
counter. It’s a three-story high atrium with a glass ceiling. Seeing the
blue sky for the first time, my heart lifted slightly.  
Now I can go outside… I can get to a proper place from this
incomprehensible one.  
I headed towards the entrance and pushed open the glass door piled with
fallen leaves, but at that moment, my body was overcome with "fear," and
I stopped in my tracks.  
“――!”  
A dark, deep forest spread before my eyes… I strained my eyes, sensing
something’s "presence" deep within.  
“‘Something’ is there…”  
In the depths of the forest… in the gap between the trees, in the
sunlight filtering through, it was there.  
“…A deer?”  
  
It’s definitely a "deer." It looks like a young stag with two straight,
unbranched antlers.  
But… its size is terrifyingly large, as if my sense of perspective has
been distorted.  
The leaves of the surrounding trees looked as small as grains of sand.
The large trees of the forest appeared as a thin grove.  
I involuntarily gasped at its sheer majesty, and at my slightly leaked
"presence," the giant deer raised its head and turned its black eyes
toward me.  
…I thought the sight was beautiful. But more than that, it was just too
abnormal.  
I stared silently at the deer, intimidated by its appearance.  
But… perhaps sensing my inner turmoil as "fear," the giant deer
distorted its mouth as if laughing, and suddenly attacked with enough
force to seemingly snap the surrounding trees.  
“――!?”  
――Thud!  
The next moment, an antler about my height pierced my side, before I
could even react.  
*‘BumoOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo!!’*  
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!”  
  
The giant deer roared and thrust further into my body. A scream escaped
my lips along with a spray of fresh blood from my gouged side. The giant
deer, carrying me, smashed through the glass door and crashed into the
lobby.  
I was suddenly attacked by a giant deer. For some reason, I was suddenly
attacked. It doesn't make sense.  
In the midst of confused thoughts, only the intense heat of the wound on
my side made me aware that this was "reality."  
My side was burning with heat. Not pain, "heat"!  
That heat overwhelmed the terror of the sudden attack, and anger burned
through my confusion as I dug my claws into the antler, about the
thickness of my arm.  
  
*‘BumoOOOOOOOooooooooo!’*  
In response, the giant deer went wild, and my body, flung around,
crushed the stone counter.  
“Gaha――!”  
I felt several bones break. Spitting blood from my mouth, I held on to
the antler that pierced my side, and with all my might, I kicked the
giant deer's head.  
*‘BumoO!!’*  
The giant deer, kicked so hard that its skeleton seemed to warp, tried
to shake me off, leaping and running up the wall of the atrium, breaking
through the glass ceiling.  
Bariiin!  
Shattered glass tore at my skin. Pain ran through my whole body. But… it
wasn't "scary"!  
The wounds all over my body burned with heat, and there wasn't pain or
fear, just "heat"!  
  
*‘BumoOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo!!’*  
Sensing my "will" to fight back, the giant deer roared and jumped onto
the roof of the building, trying to throw me off, and slammed me against
the concrete outer wall as if to crush me.  
“Uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!”  
Still, undeterred, I gripped the antler tightly with both hands. At that
moment, my arms burned hot, and my reddish-tan skin turned into bright
red scales.  
Bishi!!  
Cracks ran through the horn, hard as steel, and I applied more strength,
trying to crush it rather than break it.  
*‘BumoOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo!!’*  
The giant deer leaped high into the air. A moment of floating, the loss
of momentum, struck me.  
I understood that this giant deer had recognized me as a threat and
intended to crush me by throwing me down from a high altitude.  
I don't understand why I was attacked. I have no reason to fight.  
Even so――  
“I won’t die… like thiiiissssss!”  
Snap――!!  
Rather than being scared of the wounds I had received all over my body,
I let the fighting spirit welling up from within me take over, and while
crushing the giant deer's antler, I turned all the "heat" in my body
into a "voice."  
  
“―――――――――――――――!!”  
  
The moment that "voice" left my mouth, it became a burning ray of light,
obliterating the giant deer's head and torso along with the broken
antler, and then it cut into the sky and disappeared.  
  
…Bang!  
My body and the charred remains of the giant deer's legs fell onto the
building's roof.  
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!”  
I let out a triumphant cry as I collapsed.  
  
…Not enough blood. My hazy vision was stained crimson and, driven by
instinct, I got up at the smell of burning flesh.  
I pulled out the deer's antler that had pierced my side, and overcome by
a strong "hunger," I dragged my battered body and bit into the leg of
the giant deer that was much larger than me.  
I continued to devour the giant deer's leg with single-minded
devotion.  
After eating most of the leg, I stood up in a daze... and as I took in
the view from the rooftop, wind blowing, my mouth smeared with blood
distorted.  
“…What is this?”  
  
All I could see was a blue sky. A deep forest that seemed to fill the
horizon… and huge, ruined buildings sprouting from that forest like
bamboo.
