# 26 Granny's House (7)

A giant male ape! So it was this guy who was giving all the orders!  
Looking at him up close again, I felt an incredible sense of
intimidation. From a distance, I thought he was over six meters tall,
but facing him like this, he seems to be at least seven meters.  
According to my “knowledge,” it's just like the giant ape in a certain
movie...  
The male giant ape sneered down at me, who was caught in the trap, and
howled loudly into the snowy night sky.  
***"Ugoaaaaaaaarghhhhhhh!!"***  
  
At the same time, the ordinary apes beside the male ape jumped off the
rooftop of the building, and from the surrounding buildings, apes jumped
out from the rooms with shattered glass, grabbing onto vines and rushing
in.  
“Take thiiiiiiisss!!”  
I kicked away the apes attacking with their claws and fangs while still
clinging to the vines, and struck them down with my antler spear.  
  
Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!  
  
Without caring about their falling comrades, the apes continued to
attack relentlessly, digging their claws into my scales and skin.  
“There's no end to it!”  
It’s like they’re drunk on something. But it's not alcohol or drugs.  
It seems that under the protection of a powerful being, they’re simply
intoxicated by the ability to attack others.  
It’s like…  
Imitating “humans.”  
  
“Kuh”  
Thinking that it would be better to be on the lower floors where there's
more footing, I tried to let go of the vines and jump down from the
building, but…  
  
***"UboOooooooooo!!"***  
“—!”  
BOOM!!  
At that moment, the first giant ape attacked. Its enormous arm launched
me upwards from below, where I couldn't dodge.  
"Kahah"  
As I spat out blood and continued to soar through the air, the second
and third giant apes, having scaled the building, attacked me from both
sides.  
On the spur of the moment, I thrust my antler spear into the wall and,
using that as a starting point, once again clung to the building while
using the claws on my hands and feet to run up the side, climbing to the
roof of the ten-plus story building.  
  
I rolled to blow away the snow piled up on the rooftop, creating
distance, and took a stance with my spear. Facing me, from the rooftop
of an even taller building across the way, the giant male ape glared
down.  
Then, three giant female apes caught up and surrounded me.  
Their imposing figures are like a huge wall...  
"...I'll do it.”  
I stopped thinking about escaping. I decided to defeat these guys and
move forward, switching my focus to "battle."  
The dim, snowy landscape of the setting sun brightened in my vision. The
crimson claws on my hands and feet grew longer, and the scales on both
arms stood up sharply.  
  
***"…Ugoaaa!"***  
The male giant ape howled at my “transformation,” and the three giant
female apes attacked.  
But not at the same time.  
At that moment, I lunged towards the second one.  
"HAAAAHH!!"  
***"Ugaaaaaah!!"***  
Crack!  
My spear and the ape's claw collided, sending sparks flying.  
However, the second ape, whose claw chipped after receiving the spear
that surpassed it in hardness, pursued me as I slipped through and ran
towards the building on the side.  
***"Ugaaaaaaaaaah!!"***  
  
The male giant ape was wary of my change. The first and third apes, who
hadn't managed to kill me in the fight below, were slightly cautious,
but the second ape, the only one who had suffered an injury, charged
forward first, filled with rage.  
High intelligence isn't always a good thing.  
It had gained human-like cunning, but it had also acquired folly.  
  
The second giant ape followed closely behind me as I leaped towards a
building about ten meters away. I could sense the "presence" of the
first and third apes chasing me after a brief pause.  
The presence of rage pressed down from behind. But—  
I’m just as angry!  
"Taaaaahh!!"  
I kicked off the wall of the building I’d leaped to, and my spear struck
the giant ape that was right behind me.  
The ape caught it with its arm. But my blow accurately struck the
previous wound, piercing through and embedding itself in its neck.  
  
***"Ugaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
The giant ape, thrashing in agony, used its momentum to slam my small
body against the building's outer wall.  
Boom!  
"Kahaha!"  
Then, a giant fist struck my torso, and blood gushed from my mouth.  
“Uuuuuuuuuugh!”  
My vision, which had been shining, darkened again, turning crimson. My
severely injured body and organs craved "flesh" for repair, and a groan
escaped my lips.  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
  
Bang!!  
The moment the giant ape flinched slightly at my groan, my legs, up to
my thighs, were covered in bright red scales and "heat," and with a
powerful kick, I rammed the giant ape into the opposite building.  
***"Ugaaaaaaaaaa!!"***  
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"  
I charged through the building, pulverizing window frames and objects
inside, pushing forward in my rage, until my spear pierced the neck of
the giant ape whose face showed slight confusion and “fear” amidst my
rage.  
And then—  
  
***"Uhohhoooo!"***  
***"Ugyiiiiii!"***  
The first and third giant apes followed slightly behind, but they
stopped their advance when they saw me and the second ape inside the
building.  
“…”  
As I slowly lifted my blood-stained face and turned towards them, my
image was visible in the wide-open black eyes of the giant ape – my
reflection as I shoved my head into its chest cavity, devouring the
giant ape's raw liver and internal organs.  
  
Snap…snap!  
Such sounds came from my entire body…  
“Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…Ahh!!"  
When I picked up my spear and jumped forward, the first giant ape fought
back, swinging its claws at me.  
Ginn!!  
***"Uboaaaaaaaaaaa!?"***  
My antler spear shattered the claws, our weapons repelled each other,
and I, after having kicked the giant ape's wide-open torso with all my
might, flew outside the building, pursued by the third ape.  
With my enhanced abilities, the giant ape and I danced around the outer
walls of the buildings, clashing and wounding each other with our
weapons.  
Bang! Bam! Bang!!  
Even as my body was struck and torn by claws, neither I nor the third
ape backed down, killing each other like beasts in the midst of the
falling snow...  
“…”  
I saw my reflection in the glass of the building.  
  
Crimson, sharp claws extending from my fingertips.  
Crimson scales, like blood, covering my biceps and thighs.  
The red quartz horns, larger than before.  
The tail had grown to one meter long, covered in bristling crimson
scales.  
My blood-soaked body, covered in wounds concealed by scales, my golden
eyes with vertically narrowed pupils, and my bared fangs. That figure
made me, who tried to confine my true identity as a "person," aware
of... my true nature.  
That’s right…  
I am—  
  
—A “Dragon”—  
  
“――――――――――――――――――――――!!!!”  
  
I roared at the heavens.  
The roar wasn't even a voice; if I were to compare it, it resonated like
“thunder” heard up close.  
The windows of the surrounding buildings cracked, and the normal apes
around fell unconscious, falling helplessly to their deaths.  
At my roar, the third giant ape leaped away, and the male giant ape
watched me, baring its fangs as if grinding its teeth, as I landed on
the nearby building's rooftop, blowing away snow as I thrust both hands
down.  
  
***"Ugoaa...!"***
