# 4 Smoked Meat And Leather Tanning

Apparently, to make things out of leather, it seems that a process
called "tanning" is necessary. I think I read somewhere that if you
don't do it, the leather will become infested with insects and rot.  
Where did I read that? Since the "knowledge" is confirmed, it must've
been the lounge.  
"――There it is!"  
I hurried back to the lounge and searched through the pile of magazines,
and was relieved to find that they were still there.  
Thank goodness…I didn't burn it. I should stop carelessly burning books
from now on.  
The information about leather tanning was in a men's magazine, in a
feature article called "Surviving in the Mountains".  
It was a serialized piece, and this installment was titled "Hunting and
Leather Tanning". After carefully reading through it, I found I needed
some things, so I grabbed my spear and went outside the building.  
  
"…………It'll be okay."  
Outside the building was a deep forest, so thick it was impossible to
see the end. I don't sense any unpleasant presence. I think it's
probably fine, but I kept a wary eye out with my spear as I gathered
branches for firewood and other things I needed.  
"Ah, mushrooms…"  
…I'll skip those for now. Even though poison might not affect me, I'll
be cautious. It’s not a substitute, but I found some wild vegetables¹,
so I'll pick those.  
After gathering the necessary supplies, I hurried back, took them to the
roof, and gathered beakers from the lab to process them.  
Then I tore up copy paper, lit it with a lighter, transferred the flame
to the branches I collected, and put peeled bark and water in the
beakers to boil.  
I'm just putting them by the fire, it's not really boiling, so it should
be fine… I don't know though.  
  
In the meantime, I'll use a fruit knife to skin the deer's leg.  
"……Hm? What's this?"  
This fur…is really tough. I can't get the fruit knife to stick into it
at all...  
But, the reason it's torn to shreds is because I tore it apart with my
superhuman strength? My hands were covered in scales back then, so I'll
try that again.  
"Uuuunnn!"  
I strained my arm. No change. I tried using my whole body's strength,
but it was useless.  
"Ah, I see."  
When I focus "heat" into my fingertips, the bright red claws come out
again. With this… it cut!  
I've become inhuman again. Conversely, it cut a little too well, and
it's a little scary.  
At this point, I feel that the fruit knife I'd found seems to have
become useless, but in a state of emptiness, I continued skinning and
butchering the meat.  
"……Fu~u"  
In the end, I got a considerable amount of meat. According to the
magazine article, if you hunt game, you have to chill it immediately,
otherwise bacteria will grow and the meat will smell bad… Who is this
information for?  
It doesn't smell strange now, but since I left it overnight, I cut off
and discarded the discolored parts that were exposed to the air.  
  
"Alright, shall we begin then?"  
Returning inside the building, I found a large metal cupboard and
started emptying out the contents.  
I decided to use the clothes I found as cloth, cleaned them with water,
and then threaded the cloth, which I had torn into strips, through the
meat and hung it up, placing an 18-liter can with crushed branches and
pine needles at the bottom and lighting a fire.  
In other words, it's smoking. I don't know if this is the right way to
do it, but I don't care because it’ll be cooked through at worst. I'm
not sure if this will deal with the bacteria and smell, but it's just a
placebo, so I don't care.  
"This isn't going to cause a fire, right…"  
By the way, I read about this in a women's magazine's cooking feature…
Maybe I should reread the magazines again.  
  
"Next…"  
I want to finish the main parts while it's still light out.  
When I returned to the roof, the campfire was dying down, but the water
in the beaker with the bark was starting to take on a nice color, so I
left that as it was and began selecting the hides.  
There were a lot of torn parts, but I decided to use the relatively
large pieces of skin and the softest ones. If they were any bigger or
there were more of them, I wouldn't be able to process them all.  
I took the selected hides and the beaker of boiled resin to the
laboratory.  
"Splash splat splat\~~"  
I plugged the sink and relentlessly poured in dozens of plastic bottles
of water. There's a ton of it anyway, and it seems kind of rotten, so I
won't hold back. Once a certain amount of water had accumulated, I added
the brown liquid made from boiled bark and put the hides in.  
Apparently, leather tanning requires tannins? Something like that. I
really don't know though.  
I’ll stir the water with a wooden branch and leave it overnight. I
should probably leave it longer, but if I do, the food will run out
first, so I'll prioritize time.  
  
"……Ugh"  
When I returned to the lounge, it smelled really smoky, and I realized
the cause was the smoking process, so I hurriedly opened all the
windows.  
I had smoked it for over half a day, but because the fire had weakened
at some point, the larger pieces of meat weren't cooked through.  
But the smaller pieces seemed to be cooked, and when I cut some of them
up, sprinkled salt on them, and ate them, even though they had a
slightly gamey smell, I found them very delicious.  
  
"Morning!"  
My spirits rose, and I woke up with the sunrise.  
"It smells…"  
But since my whole body smelled of smoke, I poured a plastic bottle of
water over my head and wiped my body with my clothes.  
Thanks to having cooked it over the fire all night, breakfast was smoked
meat and canned juice. Although it was smoked, I only rubbed a little
salt on it initially, so it's probably best to eat it soon.  
When I went to check on the soaked hides… I honestly don't know if it's
good or bad.  
For the time being, I’ll fill another sink with water, rinse them, and
then continue working on the leather.  
  
Leather tanning requires this, it's removing the fat and flesh. Because
it was soaked in water, it came off quite easily… then a problem
occurred.  
  
"Ahh, there's a hole"  
My claws turned out to be too sharp. But then, the fruit knife, which
had become useless, had its moment. Since it wasn't very sharp to begin
with, it was just right.  
"…………"  
I silently continued the painstaking removal work. Midway through, I got
hungry, so I made a soup with leftover smoked meat scraps, water, salt,
and wild vegetables and ate it.  
"Disgusting!"  
I think I need to remove the bitterness from the vegetables. Or maybe I
should use the bud part instead?  
At first, the fat and meat removal work was time-consuming, but I
gradually got used to it, and as I poured water and carefully scraped
off the thin skin, by the time the sun was high, the back of the hide
had turned white.  
"It came out… beautifully!"  
I blurted out and held up the finished hide to the sun. A sense of
accomplishment threatened to overwhelm my heart, but today's work isn't
over yet. I’ll soak it in tannin again, and then take my spear and go
exploring outside again.  
  
It’d be terrible if I encountered another giant animal. I don't sense
that "presence", but I'll be cautious just in case while looking for
edible things.  
In addition, if I find a stream, I'd like to collect some clean water.
There might be small fish or frogs, but there aren't any around the
laboratory, and going too far is still dangerous, so I had to give up.  
This time, I picked young wild vegetable shoots and collected a lot of
dead branches before returning to the laboratory.  
It was already dusk, so I cooked the smoked meat and vegetables for
dinner, and then checked the hides that had been soaked in tannin.  
"……It's a nice color."  
Not just the back, but the fur is now also stained a light brown
overall.  
It's probably about time? After rinsing it thoroughly again, I carried
it to the roof, turned over a four-legged table I got from the lounge,
and tied the hide to it until it was stretched taut.  
"Is it okay to dry it in the sun?"  
…I have a feeling it's not. It's night now, but what will the weather be
like tomorrow? I looked up at the dark sky…  
――Plop.  
"……Uwa"  
I felt a raindrop on my cheek, and hurriedly moved the table inside.
It's raining here… what bad luck.  
"Ah, that's right"  
But then I suddenly had an idea, so I brought a lot of beakers and lined
them up on the roof.  
This should collect clean water. Wait? Doesn't rain at the beginning
pick up pollutants? I transferred the rainwater collected after about
thirty minutes into one beaker, lined up the beakers again, and tried
drinking the collected water.  
"……Water."  
That's obvious. Since the air is this clean, the sky might not be very
polluted either.  
I crouched at the entrance to the rooftop, drinking "water" for the
first time in my life, and listened to the sound of the rainwater
filling the beakers with my eyes closed.  
  
The next morning, the sky was clear and the rain had stopped falling
somewhere in the middle of the night, so the rainwater hadn’t
overflowed.  
For breakfast I had a salty broth with smoked meat and vegetables… but
it didn't quite feel enough, so I roasted the huge femur I had saved
just in case over an open fire and scraped off the remaining meat to
eat.  
I've already done it, but it's incredibly wild.  
I lightly rinsed the empty plastic bottles and transferred the collected
rainwater.  
The amount collected was about 80% of a 2-liter bottle… I should drink
this carefully.  
  
The hides that had been left overnight were quite dry, but the fur is
still damp. The deer's hair is short, but it'll probably take a little
longer to dry.  
I left it to dry by the window indoors and beat the surface with a
wooden stick. Apparently, beating and kneading it makes it softer. As I
kept hitting it, it somehow started to get soft, so I decided to go
outside again to collect some more in the forest.  
I also need to find food, and I need materials to smoke the hides. … It
rained yesterday, but will it be okay?  
But in the end, it somehow worked out. The trees in the forest are big,
so it wasn't wet under them.  
  
I lit a fire in a one-gallon can with dead branches and dead grass,
added some fresh pine needles, and smoked the hides.  
I smoked the back, then the front, and after a few hours the back had
taken on a much nicer color.  
Then, repeatedly hitting, kneading, and hitting again and again.  
I stretched the hide again to dry it, then smoked it again, and at night
I pounded the hide in the lounge while looking at the stars.  
Thump, thump, thump…  
"…………"  
In time with the rhythm, a melody like a "song" leaked from my mouth.  
The melody, which I, a newborn, shouldn't know, sounded somehow like a
nostalgic "lullaby".  
  
While kneading, pounding, and smoking, I repeatedly explored the
forest.  
I don't know if the deer's hide was unusual, or if it was because I
kneaded it so well, but the hide didn't tear. It became supple, and
gradually turned into "leather".  
And three days later…  
  
"It's done!"  
Just before the salt and food ran out, the "fur" was finally completed.
The lining and fur were soft, and the fine, short deer hair felt good
against my skin.  
Then I trimmed off the excess, making two pieces of leather cloth to
cover my chest and waist.  
I wrapped the softest leather around my chest, the larger piece around
my waist, and tied it with the remaining thin leather, and I finally
felt like I was "prepared".  
…But why did it turn slightly red? It was just brown at first, wasn't
it? Is this like the spear- because it absorbed my blood?  
"……Oh well."  
There's no point in worrying about things I can't answer. There are so
many things I don't even understand about myself. I won't look back;
I'll just keep moving "forward".  
"Now then."  
  
I decided to leave this place.  
There's no great meaning. I just thought that staying here wouldn't
bring any progress.  
I still don't know what's going on in this world.  
An uninhabited building. The giant deer that attacked me. All I can see
is the forest and a building that looks like ruins.  
And then there's me, with my horns and tail...  
To find out, I’ll embark on a journey to explore this world.  
I'll only take a little luggage, the fur clothing I made myself, and the
antler-spear I took from my enemy.  
I’m leaving everything else behind.  
I'll travel through this post-apocalyptic world with nothing but
myself.  
With that said――  
"Let's go!"  
To find new encounters and discover the unknown.
