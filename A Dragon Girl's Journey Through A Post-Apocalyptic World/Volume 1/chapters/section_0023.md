# 23 Granny's House (4)

Knock, knock, knock...  
“Just do it however, it'll be alright.”  
“Okaay~”  
I’m currently removing the bran from the rice. All I’m doing is putting
unhulled rice into a one-liter bottle and poking it with a stick.  
The rice paddy uses the pond on the temple grounds. It’s a small paddy,
so we don’t get much rice, but I helped with the harvest too. Even
though it’s small, it’s amazing that Granny was doing it all by
herself.  
Some of the rice is left with its hulls on for next year’s planting. I
put it in a small leather bag and placed it at the household altar. Then
I clapped my hands and prayed along with it.  
It’s a temple, but instead of Buddhist deities, it feels like we’re
praying to nature and its blessings.  
Praying to the world itself that sustains us… That thought resonated
with me, and I felt a little bit of “heat” well up in my chest.  
  
After drying it in the sun, we used a comb-like tool to remove the
grains and blow away the hulls to get brown rice.  
It’s amazing that Gramps made that too with just wood and a saw.  
The reason why it's okay to be casual about removing the bran from brown
rice is because brown rice has higher nutritional value. Even so, the
reason for processing it into white rice to some extent seems to be
because the bran can be used to wash dishes and for making nukadoko¹ for
pickles.  
And Granny ties up persimmons to make dried persimmons using rice
straw.  
I tried eating a persimmon straight from the tree once, but it was
incredibly bitter, so I hope they get sweet.  
  
In the end, it’s been over a month since I started staying at Granny’s
place.  
I couldn’t bear to leave Granny alone, and I’ve been putting off
leaving.  
I asked Granny once.  
“There’s a dog at a farmer’s house in the mountains with no one there.
What if you lived together?”  
It would’ve been just Granny and an old dog, and it feels like together
they wouldn’t be lonely and it’d be helpful in many ways, but Granny
quietly shook her head.  
“That dog there, isn’t it protecting its master's field? I can’t leave
these graves either.”  
“I see…”  
Neither Jinbei nor Granny will ever leave the place that holds their
precious memories.  
As a traveler who’s merely stopping by, I realized it would be wrong for
me to try to change those feelings.  
  
"Well then, let's go."  
“Mhm”  
After finishing all the work, Granny and I went around the
neighborhood.  
Usually I’m the one who runs errands, but today Granny is teaching me a
lot of things.  
I don’t often go to the temples that have been overtaken by giant trees,
but apparently edible mushrooms grow there.  
"This is?"  
“That’s edible.”  
There was honey fungus, chestnut mushrooms, and sakura mushrooms among
others that were edible. There are apparently even more edible things in
the early autumn.  
“There’s a bamboo grove too, so we can gather bamboo shoots in
spring.”  
“Bamboo shoots…”  
It's still a long way until spring… Apparently, we can also gather
butterbur sprouts and horsetails in the spring, so the number of edible
plants increases drastically, and she taught me a lot about them.  
“Then, we’ll have mushroom soup tonight.”  
“Yay!”  
I love Granny’s food. She sometimes gives me cooking lessons too.  
Granny was happy that I brought dried kelp, saying that it could be used
to make dashi stock.  
She taught me how to cook rice in a pot, how to cut and boil vegetables,
and other basic things.  
We can’t make anything too elaborate since we don’t have many
ingredients, but she taught me the basics over several days.  
  
“Granny, I caught a fish!”  
“Oh, another big fish, huh.”  
I even ran to the river and caught some fish. With my legs, if I feel
like it, I could leave in the morning and come back in the evening.  
“This is a snakehead fish.”  
“I see…”  
The big fish I caught before was indeed an invasive species. I also
caught another catfish, but since both were river fish, Granny said
she’ll put them in a wooden bucket with water for a while to let them
sit and remove the mud.  
“How do we eat them?”  
“Since the young lady found some oil, let’s make tempura.”  
“Amazing!”  
It’ll be my first time eating tempura or any kind of fried food, so I’m
happy.  
We only have a little flour and oil left, but Granny said that instead
of saving food carefully, we should eat it or we’re being disrespectful
to the food.  
Until not long ago, we lived in a world where it seemed like there was
an endless supply of food. In this country, one could eat as much
delicious food as they wanted, whenever they wanted. But Granny laughed
and said that even the meals she had during the times when there was no
food, and all she had to eat were sweet potato vines, were delicious.  
  
“I’ll be going then.”  
Today I'm going to collect the charcoal I've been making.  
“Aren’t you terribly cold?”  
"I'm telling you, I'm not cold!"  
Granny has been wearing much warmer clothes lately, so maybe she’s
cold?  
Granny waved goodbye to me as I set out along the road, lined with trees
that were mostly bare of their leaves except for the evergreens, wearing
only my usual fur loincloth and chest piece.  
Judging from the way Granny was dressed, I imagine I must look pretty
cold.  
I can feel the cold if I touch ice, and if I touch fire… it’s only a
little hot, but I could still feel it properly. I can feel hot and cold,
but the fact that it doesn't bother me makes me realize how inhuman I
really am.  
“Then, for Granny's sake, I have to bring back lots of charcoal!”  
  
Making charcoal. It’s easy to say, and I only have the knowledge I got
from magazines, but Gramps, who could make all sorts of things, could
also make charcoal, and Granny apparently saw him do it several times
when she was young, so she gave me advice on making it.  
However, making charcoal requires a fairly large space, and Granny
didn’t want to do it on the temple grounds, so I borrowed the schoolyard
of a nearby elementary school that was a bit further away.  
The elementary school was quite old, mostly ruined and overgrown with
trees, but the schoolyard had been trampled on for decades, so luckily
there were almost no weeds.  
Granny’s chickens were actually rescued from the chicken coop by
Grandpa, I think. They’re not the same chickens from back then - they’ve
been replaced, but they still lay a few eggs every few days.  
  
“…”  
I suddenly felt curious and decided to go inside the elementary
school.  
It seemed to have been used as a shelter, like the seaside high school,
but it seemed they only used it temporarily. Many doors and windows were
left open, and it was practically in ruins.  
Probably, there were also children who didn't understand the meaning of
the evacuation and continued to play with their friends until the very
end. Small desks and chairs were scattered haphazardly, and tattered
textbooks and notebooks were lying around, buried under fallen leaves
that had blown in.  
“Left behind at school.”  
I couldn’t help but smile at the carelessness of elementary school
children.  
I wonder if any of the children are still alive…  
  
When I broke down the wall covered in dried mud, charcoal appeared
inside.  
Apparently, charcoal that makes a nice sound when tapped is good
charcoal… I don’t really understand, but it’s probably okay.  
I decided to put everything that wasn’t clearly ashy into a garbage bag
and take it away.  
“Ah, that’s right.”  
I should look for incense! Granny’s house is a temple, so there was
plenty of incense, but it ran out after being used at the graves and
we’d also used up the supply of the neighboring temple.  
Gramps and Granny didn’t enter the homes of people they knew even when
the houses became dilapidated, but I don't know them, so I’ll take a
look.  
Following my own rules, I only checked houses with unlocked doors. I
excluded single-person houses and apartments, as they probably wouldn't
have incense.  
I looked around for old houses that seemed to have a Buddhist altar and
where elderly people lived, and…  
“Found it…”  
After checking dozens of houses, I finally found some incense left on an
altar.  
*Ting*…I rang the small bell on the altar, apologized for taking it
without permission, and prayed, and then I slung the bag of charcoal
onto my back and dashed off to return to Granny's house.  
It’s gotten quite late…  
Ah.  
“….Snow?”  
  
Something white began to flutter down from the sky.  
I see… It's winter already.  
The “knowledge” within me became my own after seeing the real thing, and
I looked up at the sky, gazing at the snow crystals reflected in my
eyes.  
“…Let’s go home quickly.”  
If it’s that cold, let’s warm her up with this charcoal.  
I wonder if she’ll be happy. Thinking that, I shouldered the garbage bag
containing the charcoal again and ran towards Granny’s house through the
pure white snow.  
Hurry, hurry… I was in a hurry to show Granny the incense, so I ran
faster than usual, but then I stopped in my tracks as I felt a slight
sense of unease.  
Something… The air felt cold?  
It wasn't because of the temperature. I felt a strange sense of
foreboding, and instead of going to the entrance, I went around to the
garden…  
“Granny!”  
  
Granny was crouching down, hunched over on the veranda in the cold
air.
