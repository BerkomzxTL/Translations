# 7 Jinbei's Farm (2)

“Hey, are you by any chance quite old?”  
  
Kyuu~n…  
  
While washing myself in the water channel, I also tried washing the
dog.  
He seemed to like bathing but didn't like being washed, so he resisted,
but when I tried hard to wash him, he quickly became docile.  
I told the dog it would be quick, but in the end there was a lot of dirt
caked onto his fur, and he had fleas, so I had to wash him repeatedly to
get him clean.  
  
Shake, shake, shake…  
After getting out of the water, the dog and I stood side-by-side,
shaking to dry ourselves, then we dried our bodies in the sun for a
while. While petting the dog's newly cleaned fur, I noticed white hairs
mixed in with the brown, and realized he was old.  
Well, that makes sense. If it’s been long enough for the vegetables to
grow wild, the dog should be old too.  
But, considering that, the houses aren’t that old, and while the trees
have grown gigantic as if decades have passed, dogs don't live for
decades, right?  
  
Kyuu~n?  
  
“I don’t know, either. Well then, shall we catch some crayfish while
we’re here?”  
  
Bau!  
  
There weren't any crows around here that would cause mischief, but just
in case, I placed stones on my best fur clothing and searched for
crayfish in the water channel completely naked.  
“Ah, there. And over here! I, the container...I found one!"  
A broken plastic bucket was lying nearby. I can’t draw water with it,
but it’s enough. At first I put the crayfish in the bucket, but halfway
through I got lazy and just started throwing them out of the water
channel. Then, the dog must have thought it was a game, because he
picked up the crayfish that were trying to escape and put them in the
bucket. Mhm, clever!  
"A big catch!"  
  
Bau.  
  
I caught a lot of crayfish, but there were also quite a few large
shellfish. There were some unusually large clams and bivalves that
looked like clams, so I collected a few of those as well.  
Putting on my fur chestpiece and loincloth, I returned home happily with
the dog.  
Thinking about it carefully, this fur is quite strange. Maybe it’s
because of that giant deer, or maybe because it absorbed my blood, but
it’s incredibly durable, can't be cut by anything except my claws,
insects don’t touch it at all, and it repels water to some extent; dust
just falls off after a simple brushing.  
No, well, it’s convenient, you know. …It’s convenient, but I can’t
understand it logically and it's left me scratching my head.  
  
Tonight’s dinner will be boiling a large quantity of crayfish with salt
water in a large pot borrowed from the house. I heard that it's better
to leave them in clean water for a while, but…  
“I think…”  
I ran back to the house in a flurry and looked for a book called *River
Fishing,* which I thought I’d seen among the books on agriculture. It
wasn't a dedicated book on fishing, but it also included information on
types of river fish and how to prepare them, and among them, crayfish.  
"...Maybe like this?"  
I gently pulled out the small tail, splitting it in the middle, and the
black intestines came out.  
It really works!… After that, I removed the intestines from the crayfish
bit by bit, filled a pot with water, and boiled them over a fire. I’m
not eating them all, but I intend to boil them before they spoil and eat
them over several days.  
Maybe I've gotten more used to making a fire this time, because I was
able to start it in a few minutes without using my body’s “heat.”  
Maybe my normal strength has increased a little?  
  
“It’s done!”  
Bau!  
  
The boiling water probably has some juice from the crayfish, but since I
didn't wash them thoroughly, I'll throw it away. I gave the cooled
crayfish to the dog.  
“Let's eat!”  
  
Bau!  
  
They tasted normal and delicious. I was slightly concerned about the
dirt, but the dog even ate the heads, so I crushed and ate the shells as
well, and I stopped thinking about the small things.  
My teeth are strong too. Since I have fangs, I can crush the crayfish
heads and claws like crackers. I’ve never eaten crackers before,
though.  
We ate about 20 crayfish between us, but the dog also ate some cabbage
from the vegetable garden. …Eh? Is that his favorite?  
I wanted to try it too, so I peeled some bug-free onions and took a big
bite.  
“This is spicy too!… Eh? Is this a doghouse?”  
There was a dilapidated doghouse near the vegetable garden. I picked up
a plate that was lying around, and it had something that looked like a
name written on it.  
“Jinbei… is this your name?”  
  
…Bau!  
  
The dog…Jinbei, after a moment of silence following the first time his
name had been called in years, replied energetically.  
Alright!  
  
“I'm going to start cleaning.”  
Kyuun?  
  
Since I'm intruding, I thought I should at least clean the place I'm
using.  
The cleaning supplies were gathered in the corner of the veranda. I
couldn't use a vacuum cleaner, but the brooms and dustpans were made of
bamboo, so they weren't particularly damaged, so I used those.  
When I searched the shed, I found a large barrel that looked like it had
been used to wash farm tools and an unbroken bucket.  
There were rusty sickles, ropes, and other things, but I don’t need them
now, so I left them there.  
Using the borrowed bucket and a rag, I started wiping down the kitchen.
I brushed off the cobwebs on the ceiling with the dustpan, removed the
dust, and swept it outside with the broom.  
I also swept and wiped the floorboards that Jinbei used as his sleeping
spot, and since the blanket was full of fleas and ticks, I washed it
mercilessly in the water channel.  
  
Kyan!?  
  
“Oh, sorry, was it your favorite?”  
Jinbei protested when his blanket was washed, but when I gave him a
decent blanket I found in the closet, he happily laid down on it.  
Oh… is that okay? With that.  
“Maybe the blanket still had some of his owner’s scent…”  
As I finished cleaning, it was getting dark. Wiping the sweat off my
brow with a sense of accomplishment, I decided to wash away the dust and
sweat in the water channel before it got completely dark.  
“Jinbei, aren't you coming?”  
Jinbei, sensing that I was going to wash myself, didn’t come with me.
What a clever dog.  
  
On my way to the water channel, I happened to look at the vegetable
garden and saw a small bird pecking at the vegetables.  
But Jinbei didn’t move. I thought it was because he was old, but he
didn't seem to chase away small birds even if they were pecking
nearby.  
Then why did he bark at me initially? Was there a mischievous tanuki? Or
was he wary of humans? Jinbei’s been so friendly, though?  
Jinbei seemed to have forgotten about humans at first. So what was he
wary of?  
“…”  
I noticed something that bothered me slightly: a part of the field,
bathed in the setting sun, had strangely disturbed “shadows.”  
  
“Dinner is ready.”  
Bau.  
  
This time, let’s try cooking.  
First, from those I boiled at noon, I took about ten of the larger,
hard-shelled crayfish that would be difficult for old Jinbei to eat.  
I peeled off the shells with my nails and separated the flesh. I put the
heads and shells in a pot, along with some green onion leaves from the
vegetables I washed earlier, and put it over a fire.  
In the meantime, I removed the sprouts from the potatoes and cut the
radish and green onions into bite-size pieces.  
There were no big potatoes, just small ones hanging in clusters. The
radishes are thin and small, but the taste should be the same.  
Meanwhile, the pot in which I boiled the shells and green onion leaves
had a thin layer of fat floating on top and looked quite tasty, so I
removed the leaves and discarded them.  
  
“Ah, you can’t eat that!”  
Kyuu~n…  
  
This vegetable-loving dog! Green onions are bad for dogs, right?  
After that, I carefully removed the crayfish heads and shells and added
the potatoes and radish and boiled them. When the potatoes were soft
enough to be pierced with a branch, I added the crayfish meat and the
rinsed clams. After they were cooked, I set aside a portion for Jinbei
and seasoned my portion with salt.  
  
“It’s done!”  
Bau!  
  
As the sun went down and with the campfire lit the garden of the house,
Jinbei happily started eating the slightly cooled stew-like dish. I also
tried it using a bowl and spoon borrowed from the house.  
“Ah, it’s delicious, maybe?”  
The taste was simple, but the boiled vegetables were delicious. I think
it would be sweeter if I added some green onions, but I roasted the
onions separately over the fire and added them later only to my portion,
so there isn’t much difference in taste.  
“Hmm…”  
Is it lacking something? The clams didn't add much flavor? Maybe they
weren’t edible clams?  
But well, I think it turned out well. I made a lot, so I’ll eat it
tomorrow morning too.  
I moved the covered pot to the kitchen and washed the dishes in the
water channel while watching the moon. Jinbei guarded the surroundings
as if protecting me, and presented me with a crayfish he’d caught
somewhere.  
“Okay, okay, tomorrow morning.”  
  
I returned to the house and decided to go to sleep for the night.  
There was still blankets, but I still don't like fabric, so I left the
door open and was about to sleep on the floor when Jinbei, who was lying
on the floorboards with the new blanket, quietly approached and lay down
right at the edge of the tatami room.  
"...Shall we sleep together?"  
  
Kyuu~n…  
  
I moved over on the wooden floor and fell asleep hugging Jinbei,
stroking his newly cleaned fur.  
Goodnight, Jinbei.
