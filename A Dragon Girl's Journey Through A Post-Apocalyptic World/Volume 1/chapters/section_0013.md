# 13 The Things That Attacked The City

"...I think it's about time to go."  
I left the remains of the trout for the raccoon and finished
transferring the boiled and cooled water into a bottle. I put on my
dried fur clothing and left the riverbank.  
The washed fur was a little stiff, but it got better after a bit of
rubbing. Oh well, it’ll go back to normal while I’m wearing it. I
shouldered my leather bag, grabbed my antler spear, and started walking
again.  
  
My destination is the buildings I could see from the research
institute.  
Surely there must be a city there. Maybe there are still some humans.
Even if there aren’t, I might find out where they went, or even better,
find clues about what kind of disaster happened that caused people to
disappear.  
But to get to the city with the buildings, I have to cross the river.  
Come to think of it, since I’m going to get wet while washing up anyway…
maybe I should just cross… but maybe not. I don’t even know if I can
swim.  
Optimistically thinking that there would probably be a bridge, I decided
to continue walking along the riverbank.  
  
“…”  
Even so… even though there are no people and there’s so much nature,
there are too few animals.  
The only relatively large animals I’ve seen so far are Jinbei and the
raccoon; everything else is small birds and fish. I haven’t even seen a
crow. It’d be no surprise if they were reproducing more, but it seems
unnatural that I hardly see any animals of a certain size or larger.  
“…Are there predators?”  
  
After walking a little, I saw what looked like a bridge through a gap in
the trees.  
As expected, steel and concrete don’t break easily. I jogged towards the
bridge, where I found several abandoned passenger cars and something
that looked like a barricade made of fences and sandbags.  
The sandbags were already overgrown with weeds, and the bags were
rotting, and when I went over the barricade, there were more abandoned
vehicles, apparently belonging to the police.  
“…Nothing”  
I peered into the open door and there was nothing inside. Or rather, I
suppose something remained, but it was in ruins since it had been
exposed to the wind and rain and ravaged by rats or something, so there
wasn’t anything usable left.  
I thought there might at least be some rope… There was, but when I tried
pulling on it, it just snapped.  
  
The police tried to stop something here. But since the barricade wasn’t
broken, they either gave up trying to stop it, or something happened
that forced them to abandon this place.  
I have a hunch about that “answer”…  
As if to confirm that hunch, I crossed the bridge and continued walking,
passing by houses buried in trees, when more low-rise buildings and
apartment-like structures started appearing.  
“…Just as I thought.”  
  
In the middle of the road covered in weeds, there were animal bones.  
“No way… a lion? Tiger?"  
It was obvious at a glance that the bones were huge… Actually, I don't
know if it was a lion or a tiger, but it's over ten meters from head to
tail. Nearby, a vehicle that looked like a riot police car was lying on
its side, with claw marks carved into it deep enough to pierce the
inside.  
…This is what attacked the city.  
But why are there large carnivorous beasts in this country? Because of
its size, did it cross the sea, or did it escape from somewhere?  
  
I felt something strange when I stepped barefoot on the asphalt, where
fallen leaves had piled up and turned into dirt, so I cleared it away
and found a hole that looked like it had been dug by something.  
Looking closely, I found what looked like human bones near not just one,
but several more destroyed riot police vehicles. I averted my eyes
slightly.  
Maybe it wasn’t just riot police; there might have been Self-Defense
Forces too. There were many holes made by heavy weaponry on the road,
and many people may have died trying to let civilians escape.  
I wonder how many people are sleeping under these fallen leaves and
weeds. I can't find them all, but I closed my eyes for a moment and
quietly clasped my hands in prayer.  
  
Looking closely again, I could see there were bones from more than one
giant animal.  
“This is… a deer?”  
Among them was the bones of a giant deer with oddly branched antlers,
even larger than the deer I fought at the research institute. Since my
antler spear doesn't have branches, mine must have been a young one
after all. Maybe the big ones came to attack cities like this and
clashed with people...  
The size is so different that it's impossible to tell just by looking at
the bones, but even so, what I could clearly tell was around the size of
a horned cow.  
“What…?”  
I thought the antlers might be usable like my spear or tusk knife, but
when I touched them, they were so weathered that they could be easily
scraped away with my fingernails.  
“More brittle than normal bones?”  
If they’re this fragile, there may be even more bones that have already
crumbled? In that case, they may have been attacked by many more giant
animals than I imagined.  
But… my antler spear and tusk knife are still harder than steel, so
what's the difference?  
  
As I continued walking towards the city, I saw even more destroyed
buildings and apartments.  
Tree branches and roots had seeped into the collapsed parts of the lower
floors, burying them so much that it was impossible to enter, so it was
unclear whether they had been shops or offices.  
“A large building…”  
Among them was a building that stood out while buried in trees and
apartments, although it wasn't particularly tall. Maybe a commercial
building?  
A building with many shops. Even if there were restaurants, I think the
food would’ve returned to the earth…  
“…There might be some canned food left.”  
  
With such faint hope, I decided to take a look inside. As expected, the
lower floors were destroyed and buried in rubble and trees. However,
climbing a large tree and entering the building from its branches, I
found only a room devoid of color with many objects resembling beds
lined up.  
For the time being, I can't tell just by looking. I kicked in a window
frame that was being eroded by tree branches, and entered from there. At
a glance, all the rooms look the same, and there were also things that
looked like machines along the way. When I went downstairs, I understood
what kind of building it was.  
“A hospital…”  
It took me a while to understand because it's broken and dirty, and it
doesn't match my “knowledge.”  
When I saw what appeared to be a counter on the first floor, where there
were many benches, and a lot of medicines behind it, I finally realized
that I was in a hospital.  
Even if they’re a bit old, I wonder if I can use the tablets? But even
if I get hurt, I heal if I eat a lot, and my body expels toxins on its
own, so I don’t need medicine… In the first place, I don’t know what
kind of medicine it is just from the name.  
  
It took me some time because it was different from what I expected, and
my spirits dropped a little. But I wanted to improve my mood, so I went
up the dark stairs and pried open the rooftop door with my spear.  
"Uu\~\~~nn!"  
I stretched my back as much as I could, basking in the sun and wind.  
I was wondering how much further it was to my destination… and when I
looked around, although I couldn't really tell from below because of the
many trees, I realized that I was very close to that high-rise
building.  
If the road was intact, it would only be a few minutes’ walk. If I have
to avoid the buildings buried in trees, it might take about five times
as long.  
After climbing to a certain height, I also noticed that there were a
surprising number of buildings poking out from the trees.  
All the buildings under three stories were completely covered in
greenery except for the rooftops, but I could see many ten-story
buildings beyond the skyscraper, so I think that’s the center of the
city.  
Looking closely, I could see a building with colors obviously more
vibrant than a hospital. My mood brightened a little as I thought that
must be a commercial building, but at that moment—  
“…Eh?”  
  
—…Ooh… Hohohohou…—  
  
I heard the sound of "something" howling.  
As soon as I heard it, many “voices” started howling in response, and
when I looked up, a black object appeared from behind the skyscraper.
That's…  
“…An ape…? Eh, wait a minute.”  
Isn't there something clearly strange about the size? Around the
humanoid "something" that could not be called an ape, things like "ants"
began gathering, like ivy climbing through a broken window. If,
hypothetically, they were the size of a normal ape, then that black
ape... would be more than several dozen times larger than normal.  
And…  
“Uhi”  
An odd sound involuntarily escaped my throat at the unbelievable sight.
Because of that, it felt like the first black ape looked at me—  
***"――OoooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOH!!"***  
With that menacing howl echoing behind me, I jumped down from the top of
the building as fast as I could.  
  
I sprinted back down the road I came from, hiding in the shadows of
buildings and trees.  
There was no strong “presence” chasing me from behind. Still, I ran
through the ruined city with my belongings, and after about an hour of
running, I finally collapsed by the river, breathing heavily.  
“Haah haah… haah… I can’t believe it…”  
I didn’t feel its presence at all until I could see it. No, it’s
probably that I didn't notice it because it blended in with the presence
of the many ordinary apes that were there.  
Well, that’s irrelevant anyway. Because…  
  
"What do you mean there are FOUR giant apes?!"
