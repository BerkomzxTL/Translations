# 21 Granny's House (2)

"Would you mind getting some water?"  
“Okay!”  
My first chore was drawing water. When I answered cheerfully, Granny
smiled kindly, her eyes crinkling at the corners.  
Since the water supply must have been cut off, I wondered where I would
draw water from, but then I saw a well with a hand-pump in the corner of
the yard.  
I see—a well. But even if it's a hand-pump, it shouldn't require that
much strength, should it? Then I realized I had to transfer the water to
a water tank next to the house.  
The tank seemed to have been something she had received from a sake
brewery. It wasn’t that large, but it was big enough to last several
days even with several people using it, and the bottom was lined with
pebbles and sand.  
  
“Hup!”  
I learned for the first time that pumping water was hard work. I scooped
water into a bucket and transferred it to the tank. I wonder if it takes
about a dozen times to fill it up? It's nothing much, but it would be
tough for an elderly person.  
“……Huh? What's this?”  
Looking closely, I saw a waterproof sheet and a hose connected to the
top of the tank.  
“Ah, rainwater runs off the roof, you see.”  
“Heeh…”  
It’s a really convenient setup… Just as I was thinking that, Granny
explained.  
  
“Gramps was fond of these sorts of things, and he made them when this
world became like this. There, that too, and this as well.”  
According to Granny, Gramps was good at outdoor activities and things
like that, and when he decided to stay here, he made the old well
usable, and created the water tank and the stone hearth as well.  
I imagine Gramps was quite elderly too, but he was an amazing person….  
“……Do you know what’s going on with this world?”  
When I asked about something I’d long wanted to know, Granny tilted her
head slightly.  
“I don't know what's happening now. But ten years ago, incredibly large
animals appeared.”  
“……Ten years ago!?”  
  
So the cause was giant animals after all… but ten years ago? Really?  
Because of what happened with Jinbei, I figured it probably hadn't been
decades.  
However, I vaguely thought Jinbei's master had stayed in that place for
a few years, and that’s when Jinbei was born, but I never imagined that
it had been ten years...  
Can trees grow this big in just ten years? If they’re growing enough to
crack concrete, I’d believe it if I was told it had been more than fifty
years.  
But it’s certainly true that the old houses haven’t been damaged that
much, and the canned food hasn't tasted strange… hmm.  
  
“Those days were incredibly difficult and troublesome. Zoo animals
became very large, and many people died…. But vegetables also grew
incredibly quickly, which was a relief.”  
“I see…”  
I don't really understand, but suddenly all kinds of creatures became
huge.  
The huge animal bones that I saw in the city, like the lion-like ones,
were actually from giant versions of animals at the zoo.  
“It caused quite a commotion back then, and the police told us not to go
outside.”  
“Did everyone evacuate then?”  
“That’s right.”  
Surely many people were sacrificed until they could defeat the creatures
that attacked the city. No… that’s not it. The residents left because
they couldn't defeat them, and now only those giant apes remain.  
  
But dogs like Jinbei, tanuki, and river fish also grew large, but not to
a gigantic degree.  
What's the difference? Some trees grew huge, while flowers and
vegetables only grew faster.  
Deer… boar… lion… cow… whale….  
Maybe… only things above a certain size become gigantic?  
I understand why this city was abandoned.  
But… I don't know why the trees and animals have grown so large.  
  
"Are there any newspapers from that time still around?"  
Even if it wasn't in magazines, I thought newspapers might have recorded
the events of that day, so I asked Granny.  
“Hmm… Gramps might have used them as kindling early on…”  
Well, if that's the case then it can't be helped, but...  
“So… what about Grandpa?”  
“...Well let’s see. Let me introduce you, my dear, so come over here,
come here."  
“Yes…”  
  
I followed Granny as she slowly started walking.  
We went around to the entrance, retraced our steps, and headed towards
the graveyard where the graves were.  
…As I thought. I walked through the graveyard feeling a little sad, and
saw several unnatural mounds of earth in one corner.  
"Gramps. We've got a cute guest here."  
“……Nice to meet you, Grandpa.”  
  
That was Grandpa's grave. The old man, who chose to remain with Granny
instead of evacuating even in his old age, passed away peacefully about
five years ago.  
“There were a few of us who stayed behind. We were all elderly. We all
decided to rest here after we passed away. This is my spot, you see.”  
“…………”  
Beyond Grandpa's simple earth grave, there were five similar mounds, and
a hole had been dug next to Grandpa's grave.  
“There's no need to think too hard about it. Living to an old age, and
then dying, is a happy thing. We’ve run out of incense sticks, but just
paying your respects will make him happy.”  
“Yes…”  
  
I offered flowers I picked nearby to Grandpa and the five graves, and
Granny and I clasped our hands together in prayer.  
Grandpa was a priest who married Granny, the daughter of this temple. He
was younger than Granny, and apparently a very energetic person, she
told me nostalgically.  
  
“By the way, young lady, aren’t you cold in that outfit?”  
“Now you're asking!?”  
  
Granny seemed to think that because I was a foreigner, wearing fur
clothing was just how I dressed.  
“Even foreigners get cold when it’s cold!”  
“Then, I still have some of my old clothes at home, so would you like to
wear them?"  
“I'm not cold, and I can't wear clothes.”  
When I explained that I wasn't cold because I had "heat" inside my body,
and I couldn’t wear clothes because of my skin, Granny made a somewhat
troubled expression.  
“Such hardship for someone so young. Back when I was younger, there was
a big hospital across the street from the station."  
"I'm not sick or anything."  
I was just born this way? More importantly….  
“Granny, have you been to the hospital?"  
When I asked what had been on my mind, Granny looked at me and
laughed.  
“When you live to be ninety, various things start to wear out. I used to
go to the big hospital and get examined by a doctor every few months."  
“Ninety!?”  
I knew she was old, but she’s older than I thought!  
“I’m quite the old woman, aren’t I? You’re even younger than my
great-grandchild, young lady.”  
“Great-grandchild…”  
“I hope they’re doing well.”  
“Yeah…”  
  
Granny's family apparently evacuated early on. They tried to persuade
her to go with them, but she was over eighty at the time, and she and
Grandpa chose to stay because they didn’t want to leave the graves
behind.  
The people buried in these earth graves were probably similar.  
But where did the people who evacuated go? What happened to them? At
that time, information was chaotic, so even Granny doesn’t know the
details.  
In other words, they were suddenly attacked by giant animals before any
information could come out….  
  
“It's been a long time since we last saw each other, but occasionally my
great-grandchild would drive me to the hospital across the street from
the station."  
“I see…”  
Granny pointed in the distance, and I could see the skyscraper I had
been using as a landmark.  
…Is that the hospital? It's already in ruins though.  
Somehow the conversation went off track somewhere along the way.  
"The reason I can't wear clothes isn't because of an illness, but look,
this!"  
  
I decided to show Granny my “horns” and “tail”.  
I’m probably not human…. What would happen if I told the first “human” I
met that…? I was too scared to say anything until I was asked, so I kept
quiet, but I feel like Granny would be okay.  
  
“My, my, do kids these days have things like that?"  
“I don’t think so…”  
I haven’t seen other humans, so I don’t know, but I think I’m probably
different...  
Granny didn’t change her attitude even after seeing my horns and tail.
Seeing the horns and scales that were different from a human…  
“…They’re sparkling and beautiful.”  
…she said.  
  
“Shall we go home then? Could you help me with lunch?”  
“Yeah.”  
I held Granny’s hand and slowly walked home.  
To that warm house where Granny spent time with Grandpa.
