# 28 Granny's Memories

“……Haah……haah……”  
After defeating the final giant ape, eating its heart and liver, and
temporarily patching up my visible wounds, I dragged my body and started
walking, breathing heavily.  
When I went to retrieve the antler spear, for some reason I could sense
its location, and when I noticed my hands were covered in blood, I
washed them off by rubbing a large amount of snow on them.  
“The hospital… which way…”  
After I finally caught my breath, I spotted a familiar building among
the skyscrapers and tried to leap to the neighboring building… but my
legs gave out, and I fell off.  
  
……Bang!  
"Kahah..."  
I managed to dig my claws into the outer wall mid-fall, and grabbed onto
the branches of a giant tree, but I could only decelerate slightly
before kicking up a huge cloud of snow that had accumulated on the
asphalt.  
If there hadn’t been any snow… no, if I hadn’t eaten the giant ape, I
might have died.  
I wasn’t afraid of death. The idea of disappearing, a newborn with
nothing, felt regrettable, but not terrifying.  
But… now it’s different.  
“I… can’t die yet!”  
  
With my spear as a walking stick, I stood up and started to run on my
overworked, trembling legs.  
I felt unusually sleepy…. I could sleep, but if I wanted to, I should be
able to stay awake for days, yet I’m incredibly sleepy right now.  
Even so, there’s still “heat” deep in my chest.  
Along the way, I came across some surviving apes on the ground, and upon
seeing that they intended to get in my way again, I increased my “heat,”
turning the surrounding snow into steam and causing the apes to panic
and run away.  
They’re no longer the rulers of this place. The apes, having lost the
protection of the giant ape, will only become food for the next giant
animal to appear.  
They might survive if they flee to the mountains where the giant deer
and giant boar are gone, but those guys probably don't know that.  
  
It took me more than twice as long to return to the abandoned hospital
as it did to get there. I snuck in and made it to the pharmacy room.  
But…  
“…Which one?”  
There are too many types, and I don’t know. I know the packaging and
names, but there are so many similar items that I’m not sure which one
is correct. The empty packaging I had tucked into my fur clothes had
disappeared without me noticing.  
“…”  
Without a word, I tore down a curtain used as a partition, spread it on
the floor, and began piling up all the similar tablets.  
If I don’t know, I’ll just take everything that looks similar. Granny
will surely be able to tell the difference.  
Believing that, I gathered up an armful of tablets, put them in a bag,
slung it over my back, and set off again through the snow.  
  
The snow continued to fall.  
The cityscape was unfamiliar, and I almost got lost, but I could still
faintly sense Granny’s “presence” and raced through the snowy city.  
I can still feel it.  
I can still make it.  
“—Ah!”  
I slipped on something frozen under the snow and fell.  
I spilled all the medicine I was carrying on my back, and in order to
avoid ruining them, I frantically pushed the snow aside and gathered the
medicine without using "heat."  
There’s no time.  
But, I can still make it.  
Wiping away tears that welled up from my own helplessness, I repacked
the collected medicine and continued to run towards the house where
Granny was waiting.  
  
“—Granny!”  
Entering from the entrance and going into the living room where Granny
was sleeping, Granny, who seemed to have been sleeping, opened her eyes
slightly and smiled at me.  
“…Welcome back.”  
“Yeah… I’m back.”  
Granny looked surprised as she stroked my cheek when I knelt by her
pillow.  
“…You’re as cold as ice. Hurry up and warm yourself by the fire…”  
“I’m fine! More importantly, I got a lot of medicine. Granny, do you
know which ones you need?”  
  
There were still some empty packages left in the dresser, but not all of
them. I needed to ask Granny to know which ones were correct.  
Granny’s eyes widened at the sight of the large number of tablets
overflowing from the curtain, which was spread out like a furoshiki¹,
then she narrowed her eyes and pointed to several.  
“This… and this one. And then, I suppose this one too.”  
“Is this alright?”  
“Yeah.”  
I poured some lukewarm water that I had placed by the pillow into a
teacup and gave the medicine to Granny.  
After Granny sat up and looked at me again, she gently stroked my
head.  
“…So dirty. You must have had a hard time… Thank you, young lady.”  
“Yes…”  
  
After that, I added charcoal to the brazier for Granny, who had gone
back to lying down, and opened the large window on the garden side just
a little for ventilation. Granny stopped me as I was about to close it
immediately.  
“Young lady… can you see those flowers in the garden…?”  
“Those red ones?”  
  
Even in the dark garden, stained white with snow, bright red flowers
illuminated by the snow light could be seen asserting themselves.  
"...Those are camellia flowers."  
“That’s…”  
After matching the actual object to my internal “knowledge”, I
understood that it was a winter camellia that blooms in winter. In my
“knowledge,” it looked a little more peach-colored, but maybe because
it’s night, it looks bright red.  
  
"……It's a flower that Gramps liked, you see. …Over here, come here."  
“Yes.”  
After closing the window and the curtains, I knelt by the pillow as
Granny called me.  
  
“—’Hanatsubaki’—”²  
“…Eh?”  
Granny laughed at me as I tilted my head, not understanding what she had
said.  
"...Young lady, it'll be tough to meet anyone from now on without a
name, won't it? I can't give you anything, but if you like, please take
this."  
“What are you saying… I’ve received so much…”  
Granny gently took my hand as I trembled, even though she’s taught me so
much about human warmth, I can't repay any of it.  
“Take it. If it’s long, you can just call yourself ‘Tsubaki’.”  
“Yes… Granny.”  
  
After that, I continued to care for Granny.  
I did everything I could for her. Instead of random medicine I didn’t
know the use of, I found a pharmacy that hadn’t been ransacked and
brought back cold medicine and fever reducers.  
Even so, Granny’s condition didn’t improve, and she began to sleep more
and more.  
And then… a month passed.  
  
“…”  
I sat with my knees hugged to my chest in the snow next to Gramps, in
front of a pile of fresh dirt.  
How many days have passed since then? …I couldn’t think of anything, I
just moved my body and continued to sit there for a long time, watching
as the white snow accumulated over the black soil.  
The “heat” in my body had subsided, and snow was piling up on my head
and body.  
I continued to sit there… for a long time.  
The day turned to night, and then the sun rose again and brought
morning.  
  
Why am I here?  
Why was I born into this world?  
What is the meaning of my birth…?  
Such thoughts crossed my mind, but I couldn't think any more than that,
so I just continued hugging my knees.  
  
—Cluck—  
  
“…”  
Feeling a slight sensation, I looked up and saw a chicken pecking at my
hand.  
When our eyes met, it puffed out its chest as if to say, 'Finally
noticed? Now give me food.'  
“…You’re energetic… cough.”  
My voice was hoarse from not having spoken for a long time.  
“The snow… stopped.”  
The snow had stopped at some point, and the sunlight, which I hadn’t
seen in a while, was shining through the gaps in the clouds.  
“…”  
As I slowly stood up, the snow that had piled up on me fell off.  
  
—Cluck—  
  
As I started walking with my frozen body, the chicken followed me,
clucking.  
I walked across the snow-covered ground, where no footprints could be
seen, went around to the garden, and scattered some dried weeds and
grains from the warehouse onto the snow. Then, from nowhere, the
chickens all came out and began pecking at them at once, and flapping
their wings at me as if complaining about what I had been doing.  
The sight brought a faint smile to my lips.  
I opened the rain shutters in the garden and went into the house, knelt
down next to the futon that was still spread out, and was sorting myself
out when I noticed something under the pillow.  
“…A letter?”  
  
I read the letter addressed *To Tsubaki-chan*.  
Inside, there were the worries she felt after Gramps passed away.  
About how the elderly people who remained in this land had died, leaving
her alone.  
She wrote about her anxieties about being the last one left and having
no one to look after her.  
And….  
About how she had been thinking about how she wanted to die, when
suddenly, I appeared.  
How she felt joy as if reuniting with her grandchild after a long
time.  
How I had given her the warmth of living with a family again.  
The sense of relief of having someone to be with her at the end.  
And her apologies and gratitude to me, the one who would care for her
until her death.  
*Thank you. I was happy to be with you.*  
  
“…Granny.”  
I buried my face in the futon, hugging the letter, and after about an
hour, I lifted my face and quietly began doing what needed to be done.  
  
First, I brought out the jar of fermented pickles that had been left in
a cold place, stirred the rice bran bed because it was discolored and
hadn’t been stirred for a while, and took out all the pickles that were
over-pickled.  
After that, I rinsed all the remaining rice, put it in a clay pot, and
soaked it in water.  
I pulled out the radishes that had been buried in the snow, washed them
with well water, peeled them, and sliced them.  
I processed the remaining sweet potatoes that had been harvested and
stored in the warehouse in the same way, and shared anything that I
couldn’t eat with the chickens and buried some in the garden.  
I lit a fire for the first time in a while, made a lot of rice and miso
soup, and ate the rice along with the pickled vegetables  
I’ll eat everything Granny made without leaving anything behind.  
“It’s delicious, Granny…”  
  
I put the remaining canned food and other necessities into my leather
bag, and carefully stored the bag of rice seeds on the kamidana³.  
Finally, I offered incense to Granny, Gramps, and everyone else, and
after a long prayer, I grabbed my spear and stood up.  
“I’m off… I’ll come again. You guys stay well, too.”  
  
—Cluck—  
  
…I wonder if they understand what I’m saying.  
Well, if they were fine even when they were left alone for a month in
the middle of winter, they’ll probably be alright.  
"...I guess I'll do it, just in case."  
I concentrated “heat” into my right arm, growing scales and claws on my
arm which had returned to its original state, and carved deep claw marks
into the trees surrounding the house.  
This is the territory of the “Dragon.” I won’t forgive anyone who enters
without permission.  
  
I then went to the commercial building I saw from the skyscraper.  
In this area, commercial buildings and stations are integrated, and so I
should be able to efficiently reach my destination by following the
tracks.  
And with that, I was able to find a bookstore, which was my initial
goal, and get a rough map and the newest newspaper from that time.  
“…South?”  
  
It seems people evacuated to the south. They headed there by land and
sea, but some didn't make it by sea.  
The newspaper didn't say whether they reached their destination safely
by land, but it said that some of the giant animals followed them.  
…The article didn’t specify any further than that.  
I don’t know if any humans are still alive.  
It seems that these giant animals have a habit of attacking humans, so
I’ll likely encounter more as I go further.  
But I’m going on a journey to see the world.  
Repeating encounters… and partings.  
  
“…”  
As I broke down the door and went out onto the roof, as if sensing my
“presence,” apes from the skyscrapers howled in warning, so I opened my
mouth towards that direction.  
  
“――――――――――――――――――――!!”  
  
A thunderous roar reverberated, and I could see small things falling
from the high-rise buildings due to the "Dragon's Roar" that seemed to
select those who stood before it.  
…Well then.  
"Shall we go?"  
I repacked my luggage and jumped from the tall building onto the
tracks.  
Alright, heading south!  
  
＊＊＊  
  
A single person was watching “Hanatsubaki” walking on the snow-covered
railway tracks from atop a tall building.  
Pooh\~~… \*pop\*.  
A brand-new white sailor uniform and navy blue miniskirt. Standing out
in the cold, with no socks on and bare legs exposed, sloppily wearing a
baggy pink cardigan, a girl with black hair blew up a bubblegum as she
watched Hanatsubaki’s departing back with a grin.  
  
“Do your best~. —Born from a wish— -chan.”  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This concludes Volume One. Thank you for reading.*  
*She finally looks like the illustration.*  
*I really struggled with how to end the first volume, but I decided to
follow the plot as it would ruin the post-apocalyptic worldview if I ran
away here.*  
  
*And my stock is depleted….*  
*From now on, updates will be irregular…. but first, I need to rework
and revise the combat aspects.*  
*Also, I have two volumes of sequels for other works piling up, so I
would like to take a short break. I apologize for the inconvenience.*  
  
*I would appreciate your feedback and rating!*  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*TN: It’s completed, so most of the above isn’t relevant. One side
story left for volume 1.*
