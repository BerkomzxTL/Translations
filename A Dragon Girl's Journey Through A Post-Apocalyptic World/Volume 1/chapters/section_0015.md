# 15 To The Sea

*The locations in this story were imagined by traveling around certain

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
I spent the rest of the day eating nothing but spicy bean stew. But it
ended up being too spicy, so I borrowed a sweet juice from a nearby
vending machine.  
However, it was boring just doing that all night, so I tried my best to
attach a handle to my tusk knife.  
"……Hm? What?"  
I see. It just ended with me understanding that I need tools for this
kind of processing.  
  
"Sunny day! —Uwaa!"  
The next morning was sunny. When I stretched my back as much as I could,
the antler spear I had raised gouged the ceiling of the eaves, causing
dust to fall, so I hurriedly escaped.  
I left the canned food behind, though there was still quite a bit left.
It’s too heavy to carry, and besides, I don't like spicy food… I learned
something new.  
I thought I might breathe fire from the spiciness, but I didn't actually
breathe fire. How can I freely breathe fire?  
I left the canned food on a shelf marked *Best Selling Products*, so the
next person who comes will surely eat it.  
People… Is there anyone left?  
  
While nibbling on dried meat in place of breakfast, I returned to the
river. …I feel like my eating is inefficient. In a world like this,
maybe two meals a day is enough.  
While thinking such things, I was walking along the riverbank toward the
sea when I found an acorn.  
"Ah, this is a delicious one I saw in the book! Ah, there are chestnuts
too!"  
There were not only acorns but also chestnut trees. I hadn't paid much
attention to it before, but is it autumn now?  
Anyway, I enthusiastically picked acorns and chestnuts. Although I feel
like the acorns were unnecessary since there were chestnuts, they're
precious carbohydrates for me, so I picked up both.  
"Chestnuts are bulky if you don't peel them…"  
By peel, I mean the prickly husks. I think… in my "knowledge," you open
them by stepping on them with your feet?  
"I'm barefoot…"  
Since I haven't gotten a single scratch running around here and there, I
might be fine, but I still feel like I’d lose, so I decided to peel them
with just my hands.  
"Ah, it's alright."  
I thought my skin would be fine because it's tough, but even peeling the
husks with my hands only caused a slight prickling sensation, not
pain…  
"Ouch!"  
…A burr got stuck in my nail. My nails are usually the same pale
flesh-colored nails as a normal human's. But, when I bring out my red
nails, they somehow get thicker and sharper… Mysterious!  
Leaving my nails out like that, I peeled the husks with a ripping sound
and, combined with the acorns, I was able to collect about one-fifth of
a garbage bag’s worth.  
Alright, I'll make this tonight's dinner. Is what I thought, but maybe
because I didn’t eat much in the morning, I'm starting to get hungry.  
…Maybe it's okay to just eat whenever I get hungry.  
  
I entered the river with my antler spear. But this time, the fish that
didn't show any alertness before started to run away.  
Why? …Ah, I see.  
"They noticed my killing intent…"  
If a carnivorous beast bared its fangs, you'd run away, right?  
I waded into the river up to my knees, closed my eyes, and calmed my
heart. I listened to the sound of flowing water, and gently searched for
presences, and the presence of fish gradually became perceptible.  
"……There!"  
I stabbed the spear at the sensed presence.  
Even if an amateur suddenly does such a thing, it shouldn't work, but
when I thrust at a really large presence, a really huge fish was
impaled.  
"What is this…"  
Are there things like this around here? Moreover, it's quite big, about
a meter long.  
Its face looks like a catfish, but it's black and gold? I don't know
what it is, but it looks like it'll be satisfying to eat.  
  
I used the tusk knife to remove its head, split its belly, and discard
the innards. Unsurprisingly, there’s no way I could skewer a fish this
size, so I'll fillet it into three pieces.…However, since the tusk knife
is only sharp at the tip, instead of filleting, it's more like
dismembering.  
I built a campfire on the riverbank, sprinkled salt on the fillets,
pierced them with thin branches, and roasted them over low heat.  
I thought the thin bamboo parts of the bamboo grass might be usable, but
when I heated them over the fire, they became limp and useless.  
The mystery fish had a bit of a strong odor around its belly, but
otherwise it was delicious.  
  
Like this, I walked during the day and slept in houses at night. As I
repeated this, houses gradually became less frequent, and after a few
days, the trees changed from forests to thickets, and grasslands began
to increase.  
"Is this a rice paddy?"  
I think that's probably the case, because there were traces of an
irrigation canal nearby. I thought there might be wild rice, but, maybe
because the attack happened after harvest, there was no rice in the
weeds.  
"I wanted to try rice…"  
  
I really want to eat some vegetables soon. To be precise, I want
something other than protein.  
I did decide to eat something other than meat at least once a day, but
it's surprisingly difficult. I read the book of wild plants that
Jinbei’s master had, but I couldn’t spot any wild plants among the weeds
at a glance. Since it's autumn-like now, there may not be any
conspicuous wild plants.  
I've already finished eating the acorns and chestnuts I collected
before. I picked up quite a lot, though…  
The taste is… normal? It wasn't that sweet, but I still thought it was
delicious, and it filled my stomach. But when I roasted them over a
fire, they sometimes popped, which was surprising.  
After eating dried meat every day, it was almost gone before I knew it…
even though I had tens of kilograms of it.  
On the other hand, I still have most of the thigh meat that I smoked to
make it last longer. But I feel like it’ll get moldy if I leave it until
winter.  
  
That day, I camped in the garden of a house that seemed to belong to a
farmer. The door wasn't unlocked, so it couldn’t be helped.  
It’s a rice farm without a vegetable garden, so today I think I'll look
for wild plants.  
With renewed determination, I searched, and found dandelions and
clovers… which I’m not sure could be considered food. The dandelions
didn’t have flowers, so I’m not confident, but they’re probably
dandelions.  
They should be edible, right? But how should I eat them?  
With a little more determination, I searched and found perilla leaves.
…It also feels like a seasoning, so how do I eat it?  
I have no choice but to soak them all in water to remove the bitterness
and then boil them. I want to cook them, but they're all leaves, so it's
not really *roasting,* right?  
I made a fire in the garden and made a soup with the wild plants and
remaining dried meat in the milk pot.  
Now then, the taste…  
"Smells… bitter…"  
Maybe it would’ve been better to make it into ohitashi¹.  
  
When night fell, I did something I've been wanting to do for a while.  
Unlike the brittle remains of the giant animals, the antler spear and
tusk knife are hard, probably because they were soaked in my "blood."
Still, I think if they had remained attached to the boar's body, they
wouldn't have become this hard.  
If you ask me why, it's just my feeling, but somehow, I feel that these
two are "mine."  
The antler spear was soaked in my blood, and I acknowledged it as mine,
so it was able to break the boar's tusk, which was also bathed in my
blood. Since the redness of the antler spear has increased since then, I
think it's harder now than the tusk knife that had also become mine.  
It's all just a feeling, but... I'm an incredible being, aren't I!  
So what I wanted to do was sharpen this tusk knife and turn it into a
real knife.  
Because although the tip is sharp, there's no blade, so it's hard to use
for everyday things.  
  
I tried sharpening the tusk knife against the butt end of the antler
spear.  
Over time, the knife might become as hard as the spear, so I think this
is really the only time to work on the blade. But it already has the
hardness of steel, so I can only sharpen it little by little.  
...Is there anything I can do?  
"That's it."  
I focused my strength and put "heat" into my arm. Even then, there
wasn’t a dramatic change, but with the feeling of sharpening stone with
stone, the tusk gradually sharpened.  
There's no need to turn it into a blade in just one day. If I sharpen it
every day like this, it’ll surely become a sharp knife… I hope.  
And so, with only the sounds of insects and sharpening the tusk filling
the air, I continued on, relying on the campfire and moonlight until the
moon rose high in the sky.  
  
The next morning, I smelled the faint scent of the sea from the fish I
caught in the river, and I realized that I was getting closer to my
destination.
