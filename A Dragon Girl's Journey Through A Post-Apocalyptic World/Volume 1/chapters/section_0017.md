# 17 Abandoned School

"Hn\~\~~... Got it!"  
I pulled it out with a \*zubo\* sound and raised it up high.  
"Beach radish!"  
  
That island whale went out to sea and never returned. Even so, because
it was so incredibly huge, it took a while for it to disappear from
sight, but I watched until the very end.  
The island whale probably also realized that I wasn't "normal." The
reason it didn't do anything was because someone like me poses no threat
whatsoever.  
Island whale... I’m calling it that because whales are originally huge,
but that thing was swallowing giant sharks whole, just like a whale eats
a whole school of small fish.  
It probably attracted seabirds with seaweed clinging to its body and
used them as bait to fish for giant sea animals.  
The scale is so different it's laughable.  
If there were that many gigantic animals of that size in the sea, they
could easily capsize even a tanker, and human logistics would have
almost completely ceased to function.  
In that case, countries that relied on imported food might have perished
without even being able to properly put up a fight.  
  
Well, I see… If there were giant carnivorous animals, there wouldn't be
many medium-sized animals left that would be easy to eat.  
Where Jinbei lived, in the mountains, there were only herbivorous giant
animals, so maybe that's why he's survived until now.  
"But..."  
If that giant boar had claimed the area where Jinbei lived as its
territory, why weren't there any tanuki or crows nearby?  
There must have been more giant carnivorous animals in the past. Perhaps
they ate most of the animals, which is why they attacked humans.  
Were all the humans eaten? No, there were also military forces, and
there were giant animal bones, so they must have been able to fight to
the extent that ordinary people could have some time to evacuate.  
In the city, there were areas that had been attacked and destroyed,
while other areas had almost no damage.  
There were also traces of people who had remained there for a few days
or a few months, so if the giant animals weren't completely wiped out,
where did they disappear to without attacking the survivors?  
Maybe....  
"They followed the evacuated humans...?"  
  
"All I can do is pray for their survival..."  
Thinking about it further won't yield any answers. It's because I don't
know that I'm traveling, so there's no point in thinking about it and
making up an answer.  
At least my belongings were in plastic garbage bags, so they only got a
little wet.  
The smoked meat and so on were further wrapped in plastic inside my bag,
so there's no damage. Still, it's damp, so I feel like I should either
smoke it again or eat it before any mold grows.  
"That's the thing..."  
Since it's a preserved food, I thought it'd best to keep it until
winter. But, since it’s my first time making it as an amateur with
inadequate knowledge, I don't think it'll last that long.  
That's why I've kept thinking I have to eat it quickly... but I couldn't
bring myself to eat it because I made it with Jinbei, and for some
reason I feel sad about it disappearing.  
"……Alright, let's eat!"  
Just half!  
It's not that I still think it's a waste or anything, it's just that
there's still over ten kilograms, so I can't eat it all.  
  
I carved large pieces of smoked meat with my tusk knife. I said half,
but actually, once I carved off two kilograms, it turned out to be quite
a lot. …I'll make do with this for now.  
I made a fire on the beach and skewered the sliced smoked meat on a
wooden branch to roast it.  
Since that alone is a bit plain, I searched around for something else
and found some leaves that looked familiar. When I pulled them out, I
found a small radish attached.  
Beach radish… is this beach radish? Having seen the real thing, I’ve
completed matching my "knowledge," so I think it grows naturally around
here.  
The one I just picked is about ten centimeters, but I’m sure I can find
bigger ones if I look. Thinking that, I found a cluster of beach
radishes and pulled out the largest one.  
"Hn\~\~~... Got it!"  
They were all different shapes, but there were plenty of large ones.  
The ones in Jinbei's home garden weren't very big. Is it because the
beach soil is softer?  
  
"...I picked too much."  
I got carried away and ended up picking more than ten. Each one alone
isn't that big, but with this many I'm at a loss as to how to eat
them.  
Eat it raw? That's fine for a little bit, but I don't like spicy things.
Roast it? Roast the whole radish? No, that doesn't seem right. Boil it?
In seawater? Won't it be too salty?  
I only have a small milk pot, and I don't have any water anyway. It's
getting close to evening, and I want to put on my fur clothes, but first
I want to wash off the seawater.  
"Do I have to go back to the river..."  
I thought about it while nibbling on the roasted smoked meat and small
radish I had washed in seawater. But it’ll take time to return to the
river… When I looked around, a building-like structure appeared on the
edge of my vision, though it’s quite far away.  
A building… What kind? I'd hate to go there and find nothing... In that
case, heading towards the river where there’s water would be more
reliable…  
"But, let's go!"  
  
I decided to go towards the building. Once I decided, I quickly gathered
the radishes and my belongings, put out the fire, and ran off with the
plastic bag on my shoulder before it got dark.  
My physical abilities have also improved, so if I try my best, I should
be able to get there quite quickly.  
"Ah, there's a river!"  
And there's also a proper road nearby! But…the river’s flowing parallel
to the sea, and the smell is a little salty? I might find a proper river
if I go further, so I'll pass it for now and continue running towards
the building. Then…  
"There's a small, ordinary river! And a town!"  
Following the asphalt road, I came across a narrow river, and on the
other side of it I could see a town. I was quite worried because there’s
been nothing but grassland this whole time, but I'm relieved I was able
to find a town before it got dark.  
The town... it's very small, or rather, the buildings are sparse.  
  
I'll wash myself later, and first secure a place to sleep for tonight.  
Private houses are dusty, and they’re not much better from sleeping
outside, but it's still very helpful not to have to worry about rats and
such.  
So, where's a good place... As I looked around, I saw a large building
ahead at the end of the road.  
This area is mainly grasslands with few trees, so the roots haven't
eroded it, and the building doesn't seem to be damaged at all, but
still, the upper floors are more reassuring.  
Even if it's big, it's only about five stories tall, and at first I
thought it was a low-rise apartment building with a large lot because it
didn't have any outer walls, but I was wrong.  
"...A school?"  
It's probably a school. There's various announcement-like papers stuck
on the glass, and when I looked closely at them, it seemed to be a high
school? I think.  
  
"...Excuse me"  
For some reason, the glass door at the entrance was unlocked. It’s a
relief that I don’t have to be reserved, but unlike the other towns and
buildings, things weren't scattered around as if people had hurriedly
evacuated.  
I closed my eyes for a moment to get used to the darkness before
exploring inside. It seems like a new school. The first and second
floors looked like classrooms, but the desks and chairs were all pushed
into the corners to create some space.  
I wonder why… As I thought about it and explored, I finally realized the
reason when I went up to the third floor.  
"They were sheltering here..."  
  
The third floor was a gymnasium, and there were many blankets and
cardboard partitions, with traces of life remaining, as if they had
slept and lived there.  
I think this place was probably used as a temporary shelter for nearby
residents.  
The space in the classroom was probably used to store large luggage that
couldn't be brought here. The classrooms seemed to have something like
air conditioning, so they might have been more comfortable, but if there
was a risk of giant animals attacking, the lower floors would be
scary.  
This place isn't that messy, and the town didn't look like it’d been
destroyed, so maybe rescue vehicles like large buses came before the
lifelines were cut, and they left from here.  
  
I decided to stay here for the night, so I put down my belongings and
headed to the river with only my antler spear.  
The nearby river was a small one, about five meters wide. It might have
been wider originally, but it looks small because a lot of grass has
grown.  
Splash!  
"Fuuh."  
I jumped right into the river. Even in the deepest parts, the water only
reaches my thighs. And, because it's been quite a while since people
left, the water’s very clean.  
There might be crayfish and turtles here. And if there are big frogs, it
seems that food will be manageable.  
While thinking about that, I washed off the salt with the river water
before drawing some water and returning to the school.  
Maybe because a lot had happened today, I turned over a dusty cardboard
box in the gymnasium, sprawled out on it, and fell asleep.  
"..."  
Ah, I forgot to eat the radishes!
