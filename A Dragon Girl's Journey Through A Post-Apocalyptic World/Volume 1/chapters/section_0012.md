# 12 The Destroyed Neighborhood And Grilled Fish

I parted ways with Jinbei and began another solitary journey.  
We were always together, so separating is a little… no, quite lonely,
but I have a goal, so I've decided to accept it.  
…Honestly, I think it would have been nice to stay together for a few
more years, but even though it's a journey without a time limit, if I
keep repeating the same thing every time I meet someone, I won't be able
to move forward.  
  
Frankly, I'm not a "human", so I don't know how many more years I have
left to live.  
I've been in this form since birth, so I don't even know my lifespan. I
might die in a few years, or conversely, I might live like this for
hundreds of years.  
But no matter the outcome, I don't want to live with regrets.  
Fortunately, I have a body that can eat most things, and even if I get
injured, I can heal by eating... and I have the strength to somehow deal
with even those giant animals, so I'll keep moving forward on my own two
feet.  
That said…  
  
"It's a river…"  
Walking along a road almost buried in fallen leaves, I reached a high
ground that looked like the remains of a castle made of stone walls.
From there I could see a large river and what appeared to be a city
beyond it.  
"Ah…"  
I felt a sense of déjà vu looking at the group of buildings in the city,
and realized that it was the same view I saw from the rooftop of that
research institute.  
"So this is it… That took a while."  
  
There’s a city. Well, even if I call it a "city," it's almost swallowed
up by large, foresty trees, and you can barely see anything besides the
tall buildings, but I’ll go and check it out anyway.  
Guuu~…  
"After I eat!"  
I took out dried meat from my leather bag, and while putting it in my
mouth with water from a bottle, I chewed on the tough dried meat.  
Will it soften if I roast it a little? Also, which lasts longer, dried
meat or smoked meat? Either is fine, I guess.  
After eating several pieces of dried meat, I saw the river, so I downed
the rest of the bottled water. Then, after shouldering the large leather
bag containing tens of kilos of meat, I jumped down from the high ground
with a dash.  
  
Ever since I fought that giant boar… no, since I ate its meat, I feel
like my physical abilities have increased.  
Originally, if I concentrated "heat" into my arms, I could pry open a
vending machine, but now I can carry a load weighing tens of kilos
without using "heat," and I can jump down from a ten-meter high platform
without any problem.  
…Thump!  
"whhh"  
It still put quite a bit of impact on my legs though!  
Running at a steady pace, houses started to come into view, buried among
the trees.  
I don't want to have anything to do with private houses… is what I’d
like to say, but unlike the residential area I'd seen before, there were
many houses that looked dilapidated. Rather than dilapidated…
destroyed?  
  
Just in case, I readied my slightly redder-than-before antler spear and
advanced, and my eyes widened at a sight that caught my attention.  
"This… is a house?"  
A house was swallowed up by the roots of a tree. But the reason I didn't
notice it immediately was that the house was completely destroyed.  
It wasn't collapsed by some disaster or something. Something big must
have destroyed it...?  
"Ah…"  
Looking closely, there were destroyed houses scattered here and there.
Furthermore, there were cars with their fronts crushed and scorched, as
if people hadn't escaped a disaster, but had been attacked by
"something" and fled.  
But I have a hunch about who the attacker might be.  
"…That giant animal?"  
  
At least in the *world* I know, there are no such animals that big.  
There are large animals like elk and elephants, but that giant deer was
larger than an elk, yet had the physical ability to run up to the
rooftop of a three-story building. And the giant boar, with a whale-like
body, I couldn't understand how it could move without collapsing under
its own weight.  
But, my "knowledge" just knows... that's all, so I, who don't know the
real thing, can’t make a judgment.  
Above all else...  
"My existence is the biggest 'mystery', isn't it…"  
  
After passing through the dilapidated neighborhood, which was being
swallowed up by trees, and crossing an embankment following the road,
the river finally came into view nearby. …River? Stream? Is the larger
one the river? The riverbank was covered with so many plants that I
couldn't identify them, but I was more surprised by the cleanliness of
the water.  
From some "knowledge" I had the impression that the rivers in cities
were not very clean, but perhaps because no one’s been here for years,
the water’s surprisingly clean.  
"…Can I drink it as is?"  
I feel like I could drink it directly if it's a place where the water
flows fast. I think I’d be fine even without boiling it, but at this
point it's just a matter of mood.  
"...Let's wash a few things."  
My fur chestpiece and loincloth don't have bugs on them, but since I've
been doing farm work, I’ll wash them here anyway.  
"Was it okay to wash fur in water?"  
Probably not for normal leather, but if it's the fur of a giant deer, it
shouldn't rot even if washed in water. That’s what I felt
instinctively.  
  
First, I picked up some branches and made a campfire by the riverbank.
Because it's by the river, most of the branches were a little damp, but
I somehow managed it with brute force.  
As a precaution, I searched for signs of wild animals, and it seemed
that there were no large birds or small animals. So, I stuck my spear
deep into the ground next to the campfire and hung my leather bag full
of food on it.  
I took my milk pot and drew water from a fast-flowing part of the river
and placed it near the fire. In the river, not too far from the
campfire, I took off the fur chestpiece and loincloth I was wearing and
lightly rinsed them while thoroughly washing my hair and body.  
Rolling up dry grass to scrub my body is definitely a matter of mood. I
feel cleaner.  
  
Even though I say I’m washing my body, I don't have soap, so it's just a
quick rinse and it’s done.  
"Ah, a fish."  
The moment I saw it, my “knowledge” and the actual object came together,
and I understood that it was a *fish*.  
But are there really fish this big? Maybe because the water is clean,
when I look closely, there were not only large ones but also small ones
swimming around. Can I catch them with my spear? Maybe because no-one’s
been here for many years, they’re swimming around my feet without any
caution.  
Splash!  
"…I caught one."  
I was thinking I could catch one… and when I reached out, it was there,
so I just grabbed it without thinking. It has a round head…is this a
trout? I don't know, but it's quite big, about sixty centimeters long.  
Anyway, I got lunch.  
  
Getting out of the water, I shook my head to flick off the water
droplets.  
After confirming that no animals had been attracted by the meal, I took
the luggage off my spear and instead, I hung up my chestpiece and
loincloth, after swinging them around to get rid of the excess water.  
I don't think there are any monkeys around, but there might be
mischievous tanukis, so keeping a close eye on my belongings is very
important.  
  
I’ll eat while the fur dries. I have some meat, but since I made it into
preserved food, I decided to eat the trout I caught. I don't really know
if it's a trout or not.  
Since it was still alive, I used my tusk knife to cut around its head to
kill it and drain its blood. After that, I cut open the belly of the
trout, carefully took out the innards without damaging them, washed them
in the river water, and it somehow started to look like food.  
"…Is it too big? But I'll try."  
I wanted to try something, so I decided to make it into a skewer. A 60cm
fish skewer… I'm not sure if it’ll cook properly.  
But let's do it. If I fail, I can learn from it.  
  
I carefully peeled off the scales with my tusk knife and washed it again
with water. Even though I call it a tusk knife, it's not really a
sharpened blade, so the scales didn't peel off cleanly and the surface
was covered in scratches.  
What should I use for skewers… There's bamboo grass on the riverbank,
but it's probably not going to work. There may be thick bamboo if I
search around, but it's too much of a hassle to go looking for it on a
whim, so I simply borrowed a branch from a nearby tree.  
But…  
"It's not a skewer, it's a stake."  
It feels a bit grotesque to stab it with a thick branch. Well, I gave
up, thinking that's how it is, and roughly smeared it with salt and
stabbed it next to the campfire.  
  
"Is it done yet, is it done yet~♪"  
I squatted down in front of the campfire and waited for it to cook while
poking it with my tusk knife.  
While I was doing that, I noticed the presence of an animal watching me
from a little distance away, perhaps attracted by the smell of the
grilling fish.  
"Tanuki... no, a raccoon?"  
Heeh… they live here too? Like an invasive species¹ or something? But…  
"...That won't do."  
I understood at a glance. It's just my intuition, but unlike Jinbei, I
feel like it won't get attached to “people”.  
"…Go."  
I glared at it in a slightly "intimidating" manner, and whether it
sensed something from me or not, the raccoon jumped slightly and ran
away.  
I feel a little sorry, but I don't intend to care about animals I can't
understand.  
  
Well, to cut straight to the point, the grilled trout skewer got burnt.
Even after roasting it for about an hour, it wasn't cooked through, so
when I brought it closer to the fire, the surface got burnt.  
But the inside was still tasty and I had fun, so I made a mental note to
do it again.
