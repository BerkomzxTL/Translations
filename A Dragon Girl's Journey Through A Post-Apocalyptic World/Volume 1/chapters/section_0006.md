# 6 Jinbei's Farm (1)

*A story about a dog*  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Bau bau!  
  
"Eh? A dog?"  
I looked up at the sound of barking, and there was a dog. Eh? What? A
Shiba Inu? It's pretty dirty and disheveled, but probably a Shiba Inu.  
A stray dog? Is it going to attack me? Thinking that, I readied my
spear, but the dirty Shiba Inu only growled and didn't come any
closer.  
"Ah, I see."  
I looked around and finally noticed. Behind the Shiba Inu, hidden among
the trees, was a house, and I seemed to have wandered past a rotted
fence. So where am I?  
"...Are these vegetables?"  
They were covered with weeds and half-wild, but I think these are
probably vegetables. ...Which means, this is the garden of that house's
owner?  
Probably, the vegetables withered and became fertilizer, and the ones
that luckily had seeds survived and continued to grow. I was touched by
the strength of such life and reached out my hand.  
  
Uuuuuuuuu!  
  
"Ah, yeah, yeah, I shouldn't touch them, should I?"  
The Shiba Inu was growling, so I pulled my hand away from the garden.  
This dog must have been carefully guarding this garden. Probably...for a
long time.  
"Hellooo! Is the owner homeeee~?"  
I put down my luggage, called out to the dog, and waved. The dog looked
wary, but at least stopped growling for the time being.  
Silence fell as I looked at the dog. I have no hostility towards it. In
fact, besides being attacked or obtaining food, I have no intention of
harming anything needlessly.  
The dog and I stared at each other in silence for a while. Well, the dog
was glaring.  
After a while, the hostility disappeared from its eyes, and from the
initial "stray dog" atmosphere, it gradually seemed to return to being a
"pet dog," showing how lonely it must have been.  
  
...Kuun.  
  
"Oh, good boy."  
The dog approached me and licked my outstretched fingertip. I sensed
that it had opened up to me and tried stroking its neck  
"You're so dirty. You're thin. You've worked hard."  
After petting its rough fur for a while, the dog suddenly moved away
from me and turned its back.  
  
Bau!  
  
"Hm? Follow me?"  
Feeling like it had told me that, I followed the dog. I think the
destination is that house just over there, but the dog kept looking back
to make sure I was following, guiding me on the way.  
Apart from the firmly packed-down areas, the ground was overgrown with
weeds, but the parts that couldn't be seen from the garden... going
around to the side of the house, I was certain that no one lived here
anymore.  
...And that no one would ever return.  
  
The dog seemed used to it as he climbed over to the veranda, which was
left open, and lay down on some blankets that had been piled up at the
back of the scratched wooden floor.  
"Is that your bed? Amazing."  
  
Bau!  
  
Perhaps thinking it had been praised, the dog barked proudly, wagging
its tail.  
"Excuse me~"  
I also put my belongings on the veranda and followed the dog inside. The
tatami mats were scratched and dirty, but the sliding door leading
inside was securely shut, and when I reached for it, the dog looked
up.  
"Is this not allowed?"  
I asked, but the dog said nothing, only getting up and coming closer to
me.  
Feeling I had received permission, I carefully opened the dusty door,
revealing a slightly discolored tatami room and a kitchen. Although dust
had accumulated, the previous occupants had taken good care of it, as it
didn't feel particularly old.  
When I went inside, the dog stopped outside the door, as if there was a
boundary line.  
"Aren't you coming in?"  
  
Kyuuun....  
  
I guess it had been trained not to enter the tatami room from the
veranda.  
But the dog didn't seem unhappy about it, and looked rather proud, so I
ruffled its head.  
"I'll just take a quick look, so wait for me."  
  
Bau!  
  
Since this was the dog's master's house, I decided to only look at the
tatami room and kitchen.  
The tatami room felt like a living room and still had a lived-in feel.
An elderly couple lived here... I think? Surely they were farmers; there
were several books on agriculture.  
How many years had it been since they left? But... they probably
couldn't take the dog with them when they evacuated. Still, the master,
who loved the dog, must have realized that they wouldn't be able to
return, leaving the veranda open for the dog to sleep there.  
  
The refrigerator was neatly cleaned out. There was nothing left except
for some dried-up sauces.  
I thought there might be some canned food... Maybe they took it with
them just in case? In a place like this, a car would be essential, so
they probably evacuated, taking what they needed for the car.  
  
Guuu....  
It's almost noon. I'm getting hungry, so I need to find something to
eat.  
"Speaking of which, what do you do for food?"  
When I asked after having lightly explored and returned, the dog tilted
its head and wagged its tail in confusion.  
This dog must have been eating something to survive before the
vegetables went wild. Living things need water too.  
I went outside and asked the dog, which had followed me to the edge of
the wild garden.  
"Can I have some vegetables?"  
  
Uuuuuu....  
  
I’m sure it must be remembering its life with its "master." Reacting to
when I said *vegetables*, the dog growled softly and tugged on my
loincloth.  
"Whoa, don't pull! I get it, so don't pull it."  
It's fine because the tail prevents me from falling, but it's my only
set of clothes, so I want to take care of it.  
"Hm?"  
After a minor battle over the loincloth, I realized the dog was trying
to take me somewhere, so I followed it. And then....  
  
Bau!  
  
"Is this another garden?"  
Reacting to my voice, the dog placed something it pulled from the garden
in front of me, and started to munch on what looked like a cabbage.  
This is...small and thin, but is it a radish? Did it share this with
me?  
I followed the dog's example, brushing off the dirt and biting into the
raw radish.  
"Spicy!"  
  
I hadn't noticed it because it was overgrown with weeds, but there was a
stone partition next to the veranda, where vegetables had also gone
wild. Was this a home garden for the family? Since it was only for the
family, there weren't many vegetables, but there were various types.  
I've never seen some of these before, but I somehow "know" them. At a
glance, pumpkin, soybeans, leeks, potatoes, radish, cabbage... wait?  
"What are these bones?"  
Crushed shells and small animal bones were piled up next to the home
garden. When I pointed at the bones, the dog called me again, trying to
take me somewhere, so I followed. Then, I heard a faint sound of
water.  
  
"A water channel huh..."  
There was a concrete water channel about one meter wide, right near the
house.  
It wasn't a tap, but it seemed to draw water from a natural stream, as
there was a fair amount of water flowing through it. The bottom was
filled with sand, not soil, and it’s quite shallow, but fallen leaves
were flowing, and water plants were growing, so it looked quite clean.  
It's no different from a normal stream. I could see crayfish and small
fish, so the dog must have been catching and eating them here.  
It's a little risky to drink directly since there are living things.  
"Alright!"  
Splash! I took off the fur from my waist and chest and started washing
my body in the knee-deep water channel.  
Up until now, I had only been pouring water over my head or wiping
myself with a wet cloth, so I really want to wash my body properly.  
Ah, that's right!  
"I'll wash you too, come on! It's okay, it'll be quick."  
  
Kyan!?
