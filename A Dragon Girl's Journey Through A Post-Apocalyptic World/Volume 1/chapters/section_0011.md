# 11 Jinbei's Farm (6)

There was more giant boar meat than I could possibly eat, so I had to
discard most of it.  
From the start, it was of poor taste, and the meat around the stomach
had a terrible stench, so I only took the high-quality cuts of loin and
fillet, and the tender part of the thigh meat. Even that alone was
probably several hundred kilograms, far more than I usually eat, so I
decided to process everything except the tenderloin.  
"What should I do about Jinbei's dinner, anyway?"  
I cut out the soft, usable parts of the giant boar's hide. I soaked them
in water with tree bark in a tub I borrowed from the shed. Once that was
done, I started worrying about dinner.  
Considering I ate that enormous heart and liver, I still want something
a little more human-like to eat, not just raw meat.  
So I placed some stones next to the campfire and started grilling the
meat I had cut into rough slices on top of it, while Jinbei sniffed it
repeatedly.  
  
"...Are you hungry?"  
  
Bau!  
  
So, he won’t touch it raw, but he'll eat it cooked… I cooled some down
and gave it to Jinbei. I ate a piece myself and… hmm?  
"...Does it taste better raw?"  
Grilling it made it ordinary, or rather, just meat. Maybe Jinbei doesn't
like the strong flavor of raw meat? Well, he's an old dog, so I guess it
can't be helped.  
I grilled as much as we needed, and Jinbei and I had a simple dinner of
just meat. That night, I slept beside the campfire while cuddling with
Jinebi, keeping watch to prevent small animals from gnawing on the
massive amount of meat.  
There's a lot to do starting tomorrow.  
  
The next morning, I woke up with the rising sun and grilled more meat
for Jinbei. As for me… raw will be fine. I used the knife I borrowed
from the house to chop it roughly… why? It was easy to cut with the
knife when cooked, but raw, the meat was too hard to cut properly.  
I had no choice but to tear it into manageable pieces with my nails and
ended up gnawing on it in chunks. ...Yeah, I still think it tastes
better raw.  
  
"Jinbei, can I borrow something from the pantry?"  
  
Uuuu…Bau!  
  
Just when I thought he'd refuse, I was given permission. I searched the
pantry in the house, which I hadn't touched yet, and I was relieved to
find what I was looking for right away.  
"Found some salt! Oh, Jinbei, can I have this too?"  
I expected to find a box of unopened salt in the mountain of supplies,
and sure enough, there it was. As a bonus, I found a brand-new
toothbrush. When I waved it through the pantry door, he allowed me to
have that too, so I took it.  
Until now, I'd been cleaning between my teeth with grass stems and such,
so this toothbrush is a first for me.  
I feel like my body won't get cavities, and even if I did get them
they’ll probably "heal". Still, for me who's becoming less and less
human, there's meaning in doing things that are… Human-Like.  
Anyway, since I got the salt I was looking for, I can finally start the
processing. I was running low on the salt I got from the previous house,
so I’m honestly very happy.  
  
I'll start processing the meat today. I don't know the proper way to do
it, though, so I'll just wing it.  
First, I rubbed salt and some herb-like wild plants into the chunks of
thigh meat and hung them on a clothesline to drain.  
…It’s bending under the weight, but will it be alright?  
By the way, even though the raw meat was left out overnight, there was
not a single insect, let alone a rat, on it.  
In fact, they seem to be avoiding it… ? Maybe, like Jinbei, ordinary
creatures can't eat the raw meat of giant animals? If that's the case,
maybe I don't need to worry about parasites?  
The thigh meat could be left alone for a while. Next, I rinsed the hide
that had been soaking in water and bark under running water from the
water channel. While that happened, I filled the washed tub with water
again, dumped in herbs and salt, and threw in ends of thin loin meat I
sliced using a tusk knife.  
…By the time I finished, it was past noon. I was thinking about
processing the meat again to get rid of the excess, but when Jinbei went
to eat some cabbage, I quietly ate some raw meat.  
"Jinbei! Chase away any birds that come!"  
  
Bau!  
  
I left Jinbei to watch over the meat and continued weeding the garden
for the first time in two days.  
Patiently, I removed all the weeds, getting the roots as well, and added
a little leaf mold around the base of the wild vegetables.  
As evening approached, the smoke from the burning giant boar in the
distance was thinning. I decided to add some fuel by ramming a whole
fallen tree into the fire. …Please don't rain.  
Dinner was radish, potatoes, and tenderloin stew. I added some green
onions and salt to mine.  
I left Jinbei, who yawned after eating, by the campfire and went to get
the hide I'd soaked in the water channel to start the tanning process.  
  
I was thinking I could use the giant boar's hide for something but… it’s
not getting soft at all.  
The problem is that it's too huge; the hide is thick, and the hair is
coarse and prickly. I did peel off the soft belly part, but it's not
usable for clothing, so I'm thinking I could use its toughness to make a
*leather bag*.  
Thanks to soaking it in water, the fat and meat peeled off surprisingly
easily.  
The tool I used was the boar's tusk. The tusk that stabbed me was
slightly stained red at the tip, so I snapped off that 30cm portion and
used it as a makeshift knife.  
It was also useful for butchering the boar's meat. If I have the time, I
might attach a handle to it.  
That night, I slept by the campfire again, hugging Jinbei while keeping
an eye on the meat.  
  
The next morning, after eating the leftover stew, I drained the thinly
sliced meat that had been soaked in saltwater and hung it to dry on a
washed wire rack… This is also threatening to break under the weight.  
  
Bau!  
  
"...It's lunchtime already?"  
The morning was spent doing that again. But it’s quite a sight to see
dozens of kilos of meat lined up.  
I put the meat in a well-ventilated shady place. I made sure the salt
was light so that Jinbei could eat it too, but I reminded him not to eat
it yet. I asked him to watch over it again, and then I started preparing
lunch.  
For lunch, I grilled some more tenderloin again. Eating the same meat,
raw or cooked, gets a bit boring.  
Jinbei was also eating raw cabbage again.  
  
In the afternoon, I softened the hide I'd stretched between the trees by
beating it with a stick. But, maybe because of the thickness, it still
wouldn’t get as soft as the deer hide.  
"Maybe I didn't soak it in tannin enough..."  
Is the color lighter compared to the deer hide? Is it not turning red
because it hasn't been bathed in my blood?  
I have a feeling that bugs aren't coming near it like the raw meat, but
I'll increase the smoking time just in case.  
I flipped the dried, thin slices of meat, pulled weeds from the garden,
and repeated the process of beating the hide.  
…The giant boar hasn’t completely burned yet.  
I continued the process the next day too, discarding only the meat that
started to smell a bit.  
Jinbei got bored of keeping watch and was running around chasing small
birds.  
  
The next day, I finally got around to processing the thigh meat that had
been left drying.  
I couldn't find anything suitable, so I decided to borrow the metal
storage shed that was outside. After carefully taking out the contents
and moving them into the living room, and giving it a quick clean, I
hung the chunks of thigh meat inside, and also put in the thinly sliced
meat, which had dried considerably. I then smoked them with a small
amount of wood.  
The hide had also dried quite a bit too, so I smoked that one outside
like normal.  
  
Once the thin slices were cooked through, I took them off and let them
dry on the wire rack.  
I smoked the chunks of thigh meat with a small amount of smoke for a
long time. An article I read in a magazine said it was better for
long-term preservation.  
How long should I smoke them for? I had no idea, so I decided to smoke
them overnight.  
  
Bau bau!  
  
"...Bored?"  
Jinbei seemed bored of just sitting there. When I was tidying up the
shed, I found a rubber ball, so I played with Jinbei for a while.  
That night, I beat the smoked hide with a stick, kneaded it, beat it,
kneaded it again, and beat it some more to soften it.  
...It's still not as soft as deer hide. Oh well.  
My whole body smelled like smoke, so I thoroughly washed my body and
hair in the water channel.  
  
...I can see the end in sight now.  
Jinbei also seems to have sensed something and has started staying by my
side more often.  
  
After smoking the thigh meat, I hung it up again and continued weeding
the vegetable garden while smoking the skin again. This is almost
finished too.  
Even if I carefully remove the weeds this thoroughly, they’ll probably
grow back in a few years.  
But that's okay. A few years is enough. Until then, the wild vegetables
won't be bitter, and Jinbei, who loves vegetables, should be able to
enjoy eating them.  
  
That night, I kneaded the smoked hide again… It’s still tough, so I gave
up. I trimmed off the excess parts with my nails, and tied the thin
strips of hide into a bag shape, attaching a long leather strap so I
could wear it over my shoulder.  
  
That night, I slept while cuddling with Jinbei.  
And then… morning finally came.  
The end result was a large smoked thigh, some thinly sliced ​​dried meat,
and a leather bag made of hide.  
I'm leaving this place. I decided that from the start.  
  
I have a purpose of finding out who I am.  
I also want to know why this world came to be like this.  
I want to see with my own eyes what happened to the world.  
So that’s why… I’ll continue my journey.  
  
I cleaned the house, and after returning everything I moved to its
original place, I carefully closed the doors to keep out the dust.
Jinbei was looking at me sadly.  
"Jinbei…"  
  
Kyuu~n  
  
I knelt in front of Jinbei and hugged him gently.  
"I'll leave half of the smoked and dried meat. You might not understand,
but I used salt, so eat it little by little."  
Jinbei licked my cheek as if to say he understood.  
I adjusted my hide chestpiece and loincloth, put my food, tusk knife,
and the things I brought with me into the leather bag, slung it over my
shoulder, and finally picked up my antler spear.  
"Goodbye, Jinbei. Stay well."  
At my "goodbye," Jinbei just looked at me without making a single
sound.  
As I turned my back on him… I—  
  
"…Come with me?"  
  
Jinbei’s an old dog, so he can't travel. It would probably only shorten
his lifespan. Still, the words slipped out involuntarily. And Jinbei…  
  
…Bau.  
  
He just barked once, went towards the house, and proudly stood in front
of the vegetable garden.  
I see... So you'll protect that home garden that I tended to this time,
too, huh.  
"Jinbei… live a long life!!"  
  
Bauuuuuu!  
  
With a trembling voice, I said goodbye, turned my back on Jinbei, and
took off running.  
And so, I'll continue my wandering journey once more.  
  
In search of something new…
