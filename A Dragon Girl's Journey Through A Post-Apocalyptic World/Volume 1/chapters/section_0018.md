# 18 Exploring The School

"I totally forgot about the radishes..."  
I woke up in the gymnasium and felt depressed after seeing the enormous
amount of beach radishes I'd harvested in the plastic bag.  
"...Let's look for a pot first."  
In the first place, I came here looking for tools to cook the beach
radishes, so what am I even doing...?  
If residents took shelter here, even temporarily, there should be a
place to cook.  
Even if all they ate was pre-cooked food, surely they’d have a large pot
for heating it up, right?  
With that in mind, I began to explore...  
  
"...I’m naked."  
I took out my fur outfit from my belongings, put it on, and began to
explore the brightly lit school.  
It's fine to be naked since no-one's here, but if there are signs of
people having been here, I somehow feel like I should wear clothes.  
  
It seems like all the important facilities are on the upper floors.
There were large rooms and places like a hotel lounge, but the vending
machines were all empty.  
Probably the evacuees drank everything when the electricity was still
on. Still, I'll put anything usable that remains in a garbage bag.  
There was a nurse’s office, but the medicines were also empty. There was
also a room with rows of computers and a staff room, but they're useless
to me right now.  
However—  
"A library!"  
Lots of books!...or rather, there aren't that many books. I guess
everything could be handled by computers and other devices.  
Still, I'll check later to see if there's anything useful.  
  
...So. In the end, the pot and cooking place were on the first
floor...or rather, in a different building. A cafeteria, maybe? The
seats were in disarray, so maybe everyone ate their meals here.  
Naturally, there were large pots, so I decided to borrow one to cook.
But, a small problem arose. Although having few trees made it easy to
explore, there was a lack of wood for firewood.  
I had no choice but to break down thin, dead trees lining the road and
break them into firewood with my spear.  
I took a large pot to the river, washed it, and drew water.  
"It's awkward to carry..."  
It's hundreds of meters from the river, so carrying a large pot full of
water was quite troublesome.  
Of course, making a fire indoors is a no-go, so I made a fire outside
the cafeteria.  
There's a lot of dry grass in the grassland, so lighting the fire was
easy. But if I’m not careful, it could easily turn into a huge fire, so
I did it on the concrete right in front of the cafeteria.  
I filled the large pot with water, but half of it was gone by the time I
got back… From that, I transferred some to a milk pot to use as drinking
water, and then put the radishes in the water in the big pot.  
Of course, not whole. I wanted to peel them with the tusk knife...but
that was impossible, so I scraped off the skin, chopped them into random
pieces, and threw them into the pot one after another.  
"Only half will fit..."  
Even though they were small, a dozen radishes was still too many, so I
only used half.  
For seasoning, a little salt. Then I shaved off some smoked meat and
added it. I simmered it while adding more firewood, and when the fat
from the smoked meat floated to the surface and a nice smell came out, I
added the chopped radish leaves.  
  
"Finished!"  
...But, what's with this amount! How many servings is this!?  
"…Well, what's done is done."  
I borrowed a ladle and bowls from the kitchen, and there were some
chopsticks left, so I used those to eat.  
"Mmm..."  
Even though I know how to use chopsticks through "knowledge," it was
quite difficult when I tried to use them. Instead of picking them up, I
somehow stabbed them with chopsticks, opened my mouth wide, and threw
them in.  
"Mm!"  
It’s delicious! It was spicy when raw, but the simmered beach radishes
had absorbed the deliciousness of the smoked meat, and they were sweet
and tasty.  
  
"Let's go to the sea!"  
I feel like I said the same thing before, but this time I'm going to
look for ingredients. There's still a lot of radish stew, but I want
more seafood.  
Since I’m going all the way to the sea, it feels wrong to catch crayfish
in the river. I took only my spear, one plastic garbage bag, and just a
single plastic bottle that was left at the school and then ran to the
sea.  
  
It's a few kilometers to the sea, but I don't have tens of kilos of
luggage, so if I run seriously, it won't take more than thirty
minutes.  
I filled the plastic bottle with water at the river on the way, and
arrived at the sea without any problems.  
"...No island whales."  
For the time being, it's out of sight. Even if it doesn't bother with
me, if it suddenly got moody, something terrible could happen.  
As expected, there were no seabirds anywhere. After confirming that
there were no mischievous animals, I put my fur clothes into a plastic
bag, tied it to the spear, and stabbed it deep into the beach.  
  
I dove headfirst into the sea, which felt slightly rougher than
yesterday.  
I couldn't find any fishing gear at the school, but I'm not aiming for
fish this time. Using my tail, I searched the sea, took a couple of
breaths, and finally found what I was looking for and grabbed it.  
"I caught a shellfish!"  
It's quite big. This...is it abalone!? I also found a bivalve that looks
like a scallop, so I'll take that too.  
  
I wouldn't think there'd be any giant animals in such shallow water, but
it's still better to be cautious.  
At first glance, they may seem like ordinary animals that have just been
enlarged, but that's not actually the case.  
Strong muscles to support that massive body. Tough outer skin that can
only be harmed by high-caliber firearms.  
The meat is difficult to cut with a knife even when it’s raw. Rats and
bugs don't come near it, and even Jinbei couldn't eat it. But... more
than that, I think he was... afraid.  
Still, once the meat was cooked, Jinbei ate it as if it was normal
meat.  
What’s the difference? Is the difference only between raw and cooked?  
And why am I the only one who can eat it raw?  
I don't know…  
Anyway, it's shellfish hunting now. Keeping yesterday's mistake in mind,
I made sure to limit myself, taking only three abalones and three
scallops each.  
Oh, and let's get this too. Something that looked like kelp was growing.
Is bigger kelp better? I don't know, so I took a few pieces of a
moderate size.  
Today's harvest is three abalone-like shellfish and three scallop-like
shellfish, a few pieces of kelp, and a handful of what looks like
okahijiki¹. And…  
"I even caught a sea urchins"  
Not those strange ones with long spines that I saw yesterday, but
probably a normal sea urchin.  
But somehow, it's all reddish. Is that okay?  
There's still a little time until noon, but I decided to eat the sea
urchins and shellfish on the beach rather than take them back with me.
Because, I've always admired doing that kind of thing.  
Ah, I forgot my tusk knife! I could’ve just roasted them as they were,
but I think they'd been eating sand, so I ended up prying open the clams
with my claws, and carefully washing them with seawater along with the
abalones. …Well, that's fine.  
  
I did my best to start a fire with what felt like a damp piece of
driftwood, and by the time I finished washing them, the fire had become
a low flame, so I added more dry grass and smoothed it out. Then I lined
up the shellfish with their shells facing down...  
...Sizzle...  
Once they started boiling at the edges, I dripped a little seawater on
them, and when they started boiling again, I picked them up with my
claws and ate them.  
"Delicious..."  
The scallops were springy, and the abalone was chewy. The salt was just
from the seawater, but the concentrated sweetness and umami were
enjoyable.  
...I think I was sticking my hand into the fire just now.  
Even looking at my hand, it’s just dirty with soot and I wasn't burned.
I could feel the heat, but I guess the scales on my skin weren't so weak
that they'd get burned in just a few seconds?  
"...I really am inhuman."  
And finally, the red sea urchin. I cautiously pried it open with my
claws, washed it lightly with seawater, and then tried a piece.  
"...!!"  
What is this, it's super delicious! There was only one, but if I find
another, I'll prioritize catching it because it was so delicious.  
I was tempted to go look for more, but since there’d be no end to it, I
stopped myself. I washed my body with the water from the plastic bottle,
put my fur clothes back on, and prepared to go home, putting the
okahijiki and kelp into a plastic bag.  
  
I washed my hair again at the river on the way back to the school,
refilled the plastic bottle with water, and when I returned to the
school, I hung the kelp to dry on a net on the rooftop...There aren't
any seabirds anymore, right?  
It's fine if they eat them, but if they poop on them, I'll definitely
throw them away!  
It was still light out, so I decided to read books in the library.  
"Classic literature, huh..."  
I don't have much experience, so it's fine to read them, but I started
with picture books, history books, and other things that might match
with my "knowledge."  
I read a book while laying on the sofa in the sunny lounge on the fifth
floor.  
After reading several dozen books, it got dark, and I continued reading
by starlight.  
I got hungry in the middle of the night and ate the leftover radish
stew, and then spent the rest of the day reading in the lounge…  
"………Fuwa~a"  
I yawned loudly and rolled over on the sofa, flipping through the pages
as I drifted off to sleep.
