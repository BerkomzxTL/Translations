# 3 Because It's Not Embarrassing

Good morning.  
  
“Fuwa~aa…”  
Sunlight streamed into the third-floor lounge, the top floor, and I
slowly got up.  
I stayed still and observed the crimson sky gradually turn blue. I’m
like a reptile waiting for its body temperature to rise, but even though
I have scales, I’m not a lizard. I have a proper body temperature and
can move normally without warming up; I’m just simply still sleepy.  
I slept naked because I couldn't find any fabric, but I didn’t feel cold
at all… however, a normal person would probably catch a cold, so I guess
I’m not normal after all.  
  
I had my breakfast, sipping an ultra-sweet canned coffee I found in the
vending machine I had pried open. As I finally woke up, and the fatigue
disappeared and the sugar reached my brain, I calmed down and felt a
slight chill as I realized how defenselessly I had slept.  
There's no guarantee that there's just one giant deer like that. What if
there are many of those things in the forest? What if there's an even
bigger deer, and it attacks in the middle of the night...  
However, this building has remained intact, so maybe there’s something
that repels them, but I decided to keep it in the back of my mind and be
on my guard just in case.  
  
“Alright, let’s do it!”  
I’m a little hungry, but the kind of starvation I was worried about
didn’t hit me, so I’ll continue exploring the building as planned.
Still, I’m pretty hungry, so I want to find at least something edible.  
I’ll take a disposable lighter for light, and this spear, which should
be handy for various things…  
“Huh?”  
Is this antler spear supposed to be this color…? I didn’t notice last
night, but when it was on the deer’s head, it was white or gray, but now
it’s a pale pink.  
Maybe it changed because it’s been covered in my blood?  
“…Whatever.”  
I moved on to explore without worrying about the details. Yesterday, I
was only able to search the third floor, so today it’s the second and
first floors.  
  
From what I could see, unlike the third floor, the second floor has no
offices, only a laboratory and a storeroom.  
The lab was rather disappointing; it only contained chemicals and
experimental equipment I didn’t understand with my knowledge. However,
there were some large beakers and other things that looked like they
could be used as containers, so I put them in the water drainer I found
along with the lighter.  
I thought there might be something in the storeroom, but it only
contained biological specimens and things completely useless to me at
the moment.  
  
I pepped myself up and went down to the first floor, which was different
from the others.  
Perhaps it was a large company, but there was a proper entrance lobby
and reception area, seemingly prepared to welcome people. There were
also large and small meeting rooms and reception rooms, and there was
even a large refrigerator in the breakroom!  
I excitedly opened it. Inside, there were small lunch boxes that seemed
to belong to office ladies, but they clearly had a “rotten” aura,
covered in dry black stains, so I quietly closed it.  
…That’s only natural!  
However, there were sugar sticks and, for some reason, table salt, so I
took those.  
I also took a fork and a fruit knife from a drawer. There were no
teacups, but I took some paper cups and paper plates just in case.  
  
“…Oh.”  
I found what seems to be a locker room in a fairly spacious area.  
They were separated into men’s and women’s sections, so it might have
also been a changing area? Almost half of the lockers were left open, so
the people who evacuated must have been able to take their belongings
with them.  
I’ll check the open lockers first.  
I wasn’t expecting anything, but most of them were almost empty. Maybe
they only had a bag or so, or maybe they took that much with them.  
The rest of the lockers were, of course, locked...  
“Eii!”  
\*Clang!\*  
I didn’t hesitate to stab it with the spear.  
  
The fact that the lockers were closed means that they were off that day,
or they didn’t have time to take anything with them. In that case, these
should contain their untouched belongings from that day.  
“Ah.”  
As I pried open several women’s lockers, I found some candy.  
This is it. This is what I’ve been looking for. Thinking that, I
immediately opened it… but.  
“Ugh.”  
The chocolate… was no longer food. Most of the sweets in the other
lockers were moldy and dried up. The only thing that seemed edible was a
snack with aluminum-like packaging inside… but…  
“Mmm…”  
I tried a small bite, but, is this really okay…? It’s a bit hard, but
it’s not inedible. Probably. I’ll take everything that seems edible
anyway.  
Next…  
“Clothes…”  
As I opened a few more lockers, I found women’s casual clothes in a
locker. Maybe they belonged to the receptionist? Maybe they didn’t have
time to change and evacuated in their work clothes.  
Maybe because it had been in a locker, it was somewhat discolored, but
it was still relatively clean.  
“…”  
I randomly picked up a jacket and put it on. The fabric didn’t seem to
be that damaged, and it felt comfortable… but.  
“Ah, no way.”  
I felt something strange and quickly took it off.  
“What is this…?”  
I felt a really weird tingly sensation. It was fine at first, but it was
bad when I moved.  
  
Why? What did I do wrong? As I thought about this, examining the lining
and seams of the jacket, I suddenly realized there was a problem with my
own skin.  
There’s nothing wrong with my tan skin except for a slight reddish tint.
Maybe because I was just born, it’s smooth, hairless and soft.  
However, although it’s fine when I slide my fingers from my fingertips
up my arm, when I slide my fingers towards my hand, it feels kind of
ticklish, like a tingly sensation, causing me to writhe.  
Now that I think about it, when I fought that giant deer, my hands were
covered in bright red scales. And even now, my tail is covered in fine
scales.  
In short, it looks like skin, but isn’t really skin? It looks like skin,
but it’s actually something scaly? It’s not human skin, it’s scaly skin,
so it feels like it stands on end when touched from the opposite
direction?  
“Uuuun…”  
I can’t wear clothes like this…  
Well, I haven’t felt uncomfortable not wearing clothes up until now, and
I don’t get cold, so it’s fine as it is, but once I became aware of the
existence of “clothes,” I felt like there were various parts I needed to
hide.  
“I-it's not that embarrassing… Nn?”  
As if to cover something up, I roughly forced open the remaining lockers
and threw out the clothes I found, and then I felt a different texture.
This is…  
“…Leather?”  
  
The collar of the jacket was made of “leather.”  
Maybe cloth is no good, but leather might be okay? Synthetic leather
would be a problem, but it looks like the real thing, so I rubbed it
against my arm. Although it still bothers me a little, it’s much better
than cloth.  
Maybe I can wear this? But just the collar isn’t enough, and it probably
wasn’t winter when this place was abandoned, so there aren’t any leather
clothes, and there wasn’t any leather furniture in the reception
parlor-like room.  
“No… there was…”  
  
I put the things I'd collected back in the lounge, took only the spear,
and ran up to the roof.  
I looked around, and there, where the concrete floor was discolored and
bloodstained, I found what I was looking for.  
“There it is… deer leg.”  
There were four remnants of the giant deer’s legs that I had savagely
devoured while half-insane.  
I didn’t want to eat the fur even unconsciously, but even though it was
torn, since it was originally a large deer, the hide seems usable.  
If I can use this well, I might be able to make something like a fur
loincloth, even if it’s not exactly clothing.  
And also…  
“Meat.”  
  
At that time, I only devoured the thigh part, and most of the lower leg
remained intact.  
Normally, a deer’s lower leg is thin and has almost no meat, but since
it was originally huge, there was quite a bit of meat attached, and
there might be about 30% left on the thigh, including the part clinging
to the bone.  
  
“…Well”  
I felt relieved as my dire food crisis got some leeway.  
If I had left it overnight, it wouldn’t have been strange if insects
infested it, but luckily it was on the roof, and there were no insects
at all.  
There isn’t much, but it should last me a few days considering how
hungry I am right now.  
“…For now, let’s skin it.”  
With a spring in my step, I went to fetch tools from the lounge to strip
the meat and hide from the deer’s legs.
