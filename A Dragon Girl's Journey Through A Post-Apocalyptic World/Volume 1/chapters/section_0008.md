# 8 Jinbei's Farm (3)

Morning arrived with the sunrise. As I woke up, Jinbei also got up. I
carried a milk pot and washed my face while fetching water.  
Jinbei's an old dog, but he's very energetic. He was looking for
something in the water channel, and when he jumped, he splashed me with
water.  
"Jinbei…"  
  
Kyuuu~n….  
  
Oh, well, it can’t be helped. Seeing him hiding his face as if in
remorse, I gave a wry smile and began washing my hair and body, removing
my fur chestpiece and loincloth.  
It’s difficult to wash because of my horns, but I carefully cleaned
around the base of them. They’re still only about ten centimeters long
and haven’t grown since. I still wonder what caused them to grow in the
first place….  
"Hyaa!?"  
Before I knew it, Jinbei had started playing with my tail.  
"Hey now, this isn't a toy, and it’s dangerous because it has scales."  
I scolded him, but Jinbei seemed intrigued by the unusual presence of a
tail on a human body, sniffing and playing with it.  
"This…"  
  
Kyan!?  
  
He wouldn't listen, so I scooped up some water and splashed him. I’m
fine even if my body gets wet, as I can just shake it off, but I’ll dry
Jinbei off later.  
When I returned to the house, I borrowed a towel, and wiped him down. He
seems relieved and unusually docile, which made me laugh.  
  
Breakfast was simple. I built a fire, got some cabbage from the garden,
chopped it up, and mixed it with leftover stew from yesterday, adding
water and simmering it.  
Jinbei, who loves cabbage, was overjoyed.  
"Not yet."  
If it's too hot, Jinbei can't eat it, so he "waited" for it to cool
down. While he waited, I added salt to make some for myself and then we
ate together.  
The taste is… acceptable. It's a gentle flavor, just mildly savory
vegetables and salt.  
  
"Today I'm going to work on the vegetable garden."  
Bau?  
  
Jinbei tilted his head anxiously. It's not like I'm doing anything big.
I'm just going to do some weeding.  
First, I pulled out the weeds in the garden. Just endless weeding. Some
are hard to distinguish from the wild vegetables, but I’ll try my
best.  
I don’t just yank them out, though. I carefully remove them by the
roots, brushing off the clinging soil before returning them to the
garden.  
…There are more weeds than vegetables. With this many growing, the
vegetables are bound to be stunted, aren't they?  
I left cleaning up the weeds I had pulled for later, focusing solely on
pulling them out. Jinbei, who seemed to understand what I was doing,
took the weeds to where I had pulled them out and threw them away.  
Jinbei’s so smart! But even with one person and one dog working, we
couldn't pull them all out, and I slightly regretted starting this
never-ending task.  
  
"Hungry?"  
Bau!  
  
It seems he is. For lunch, we ate the leftover crayfish I boiled
yesterday. I thought we’d have enough for three days, but even with just
the two of us, it’s almost gone…  
"That's right."  
I had forgotten about the acorns I collected on the way here. I think
there are definitely some that are delicious and some that aren’t,
right?  
I couldn’t tell the difference, but when I put them in water to wash
them, the worm-eaten, lighter ones floated, so I removed them. After
checking for holes, I removed the hat-like part and boiled them.  
As long as it’s not poisonous, boiling it should make it edible. Boiling
is the ultimate solution. Probably.  
As for Jinbei...  
"Is this edible?"  
When I held out a boiled and cooled piece to him in my hand, Jinbei
sniffed it and looked troubled for some reason.  
"Oh, I need to peel it."  
I peeled the shell off with my nails, revealing something like chestnut…
or a yam-like substance. I dug it up and tried eating it.  
"Mmm… it’s edible."  
  
Bau!  
  
After seeing me eat it, Jinbei understood that it was edible after
peeling the shell off and demanded on having some for himself.  
What a greedy guy.  
I cracked the boiled acorns with my nails and took out the insides…
maybe if it’s similar to chestnuts, I should have roasted them?  
The insides became soft after boiling, but the kernels crumbled, making
them difficult to remove. I got tired of picking them one by one, so I
started to just crush the cracked acorns with my fingers to get the
insides out.  
Only at times like this will Jinbei obediently stay in the "wait"
position, so I glared at him lightly while relentlessly crushing acorns.
After I had quite a lot, I shared them with him.  
  
Bau!  
"Did you like it?"  
  
He seems to have liked it. …Hm? Are acorns safe for dogs?  
I was a bit curious, and I thought there was an article about wild
plants in the book, so I read it, and acorns were listed there as well.
…It seems to be safe, as long as it’s not too much.  
Well, that goes for everything. I think it'll be fine, but I should keep
an eye on him for a while.  
  
After our crayfish and acorn lunch, I continued weeding the vegetable
garden.  
By the way, acorns are carbohydrates, right? I didn't have many, but
they seemed to be surprisingly filling. The wild plant book had a list
of tasty acorns, so I'll make a note of them.  
The book also mentioned mushrooms and wild vegetables… but I’ll avoid
mushrooms. I might be fine, but I'm a bit scared to give any to
Jinbei.  
While thinking about such things, I continued pulling out weeds…  
  
"It’s not over!"  
Kyuuu~n….  
  
The garden isn't that big, but it still took quite a while to work on
it. In the end, I didn’t even finish half of it in a day, and as the sun
began to set, I watched the birds flying while lost in though.  
  
"Chicken… I wonder if I can eat it."  
Bau.  
  
I haven’t seen any large birds since I arrived here. Not even crows or
pigeons.  
With so much nature growing, it wouldn’t be surprising for there to be
large birds, rabbits, and tanukis as well...  
For some reason, I’ve only seen small animals so far. Well, with this
much nature, maybe they wouldn’t come to an area with a dog?  
My body’s dirty, so I’ll go to the water channel. I’ll also take the
brown soybeans and pumpkin that I’ll use for dinner to wash them. The
cabbage… it’s Jinbei’s favorite, but it's infested with bugs.  
Are insects proof that the vegetable is tasty? But I think if there are
too many, the vegetables themselves become bitter to deter them.  
For my vegetable-loving dog, I’ll need to be careful not to let the
vegetables become too wild and bitter.  
  
I took the dried brown soybeans out of their pods and soaked them in a
pot of water. I washed off the dirt from the pumpkin, and washed my hair
and body while I was at it. My wet, reddish-silver hair glistened in the
moonlight. I wrung out the water from my hair and then shook my head to
remove the rest.  
“…Jinbei. You don't have to stay so far away, I'm not going to wash you,
okay?"  
  
Bau.  
  
Jinbei barked resolutely, seemingly protecting my discarded fur
clothes.  
…Really?  
  
I lit a fire in the darkening yard and boiled the pumpkin and soybeans
in a pot. I roughly crushed the pumpkin with my spear and removed the
seeds. …Can I eat the seeds if I roast them?  
The pumpkin and bean stew had a comforting taste. I made some bamboo
leaf tea in a milk pot and took a break while continuing to read my very
helpful book by the firelight.  
I relaxed while reading, listening to the crackling of the campfire, and
when the fire started to die out and Jinbei yawned, I decided to go to
bed.  
"Goodnight, Jinbei."  
On the swept, scarred floorboards, I fell asleep while hugging Jinbei.  
  
I'm fine being alone. …But, I feel like spending time with someone fills
my heart with warmth. As I closed my eyes while listening to the
chirping of small insects… suddenly, the sounds disappeared.  
  
Thud…  
  
…BuooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  
  
A sudden "beast's roar" made me jump up on alert.  
Zuzun…  
The next moment, I could feel vibrations through the floor and I grabbed
my spear and stood up. This feeling… it’s the same terror I felt when I
saw that giant deer. My grip tightened on my spear.  
  
Uuuuuuuuuuu!  
  
"Jinbei?"  
Just like the first time we met, Jinbei is on alert, growling. He didn’t
react to my voice, his gaze fixed on a certain direction…  
"Towards the fields!"  
I yelled, readying my spear and rushing out while noticing Jinbei
following close behind.  
The fields aren’t far from the house. Anything approaching would be
easily noticeable. And there—  
"What is… that?"  
It was on the edge of the forest, away from the fields, but it felt like
it was right next to me.  
"Boar…?"  
  
Bau!!  
  
It’s a giant boar. But… it's so huge it’s distorting my sense of
distance.  
From the front, it looks like a bus. Its protruding tusks are large,
sharp, and curved like mammoth tusks.  
Thud… thud… crack crack crack!  
The giant boar mowed down the surrounding trees just by walking, slowly
approaching and crushing part of the still-intact fence before it began
digging up the crops at the edge of the wide field with its tusks.  
This...so this is the reason why parts of the garden are so unnaturally
messy!  
  
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, Bau bau bau!!  
  
While I was stunned by the strangeness of the situation, Jinbei barked
from a distance.  
The giant boar stopped moving at Jinbei's threat and narrowed its eyes
in annoyance.  
  
***"BuoooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"***  
  
Thud…!  
Suddenly, the giant boar roared and charged straight at us, trampling
through the field.  
"Jinbei!"  
  
Kyaun!  
  
In the quiet night field, bright red blood scattered like flowers.
