# 20 Granny's House (1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
I was sleeping on the outskirts of the temple when I heard someone call
out to me in a place I thought no one would be, instantly waking me up
and making me jump to my feet.  
“Oh, you’re a lively one, aren't you?”  
“Ah…”  
Maybe it was because I’d just woken up and my mind wasn’t working
properly, but I was at a loss for words as to what to say to this
"human" I'd just met for the first time.  
The first "human" I saw was an old woman.  
To be honest, she was so old I couldn’t guess her age, and while my eyes
were wide, she tilted her head at me and her face crinkled into a
smile.  
“Are you a foreigner? Do you speak Japanese?"  
“Ah, no! I understand!”  
I hastily denied it, as I was about to be misunderstood in a strange
way.  
  
Why is there someone here in a place like this… an elderly person at
that? Didn’t everyone evacuate? Is anyone else here? Is she alone?  
I had so many questions, but I was confused and didn’t know where to
start. The old woman looked at me with amusement.  
  
“Are you hungry?”  
“Eh… yes.”  
I didn't think much of it since I didn't have time for that, but I was
definitely getting hungry, so I nodded without thinking. The old woman
laughed softly and slowly turned her body to the left.  
“Then, shall we have breakfast? After you've eaten and calmed down,
please take your time and tell me about it."  
“Eh…”  
Seeing me at a loss for words, the old woman, who had started walking,
looked back slightly.  
“Come on, follow me.”  
“Ah, yes!”  
  
I quickly gathered my belongings and hopped over the railing on the
outer edge, following behind the old woman.  
The old woman walked slowly but with a firm gait.  
We went around to the back of the temple’s main hall, passing by graves
that were half-overgrown with trees, then through a path of trees with
bright red flowers, until coming across a large single-story house.  
  
“Is this your house old lady?”  
“You can call me ‘Granny.’ But what should I call you, young lady?”  
“Eh…”  
That’s when I realized I didn’t have a name. I had always been alone,
and the only one I spoke to was Jinbei, so not having a name hadn't been
inconvenient.  
“Name… I don’t have one.”  
“Oh dear, that's troublesome. Foreign countries sure are tough.”  
“No, I think even in foreign countries they give you a name…”  
Whether it’s an advanced boke or just being natural, my tsukkomi can’t
keep up.¹  
“Young lady, you’re barefoot. Take this cloth, and wipe your feet over
there, come on.”  
“Mhm…”  
…Come to think of it, I’ve been barefoot.  
I was invited into the house through the sliding door next to the
entrance. While Granny brought me a cloth to wipe my feet, I peeked
inside the house from the entrance.  
It looked like it had been built decades ago, but because someone was
living there, the damage was minimal, and above all, there was a warm,
lived-in feel.  
  
“Young lady, wipe your feet with this and come inside.”  
“Mhm”  
I wiped the soles of my feet with the damp cloth and entered the house.
As expected, there was no electricity, so I walked through a dark
corridor, but soon I reached the living room where sunlight was
streaming in.  
Right next to it was the kitchen. It seemed to be in use, but there was
no sign of water or fire being used. I wondered how it would work, then
I saw a hearth made of stones in the garden, visible from the edge of
the living room.  
“Young lady, sit there and wait."  
“Ah, Granny, I’ll help!”  
When she gestured to a cushion and told me to sit, I offered to help,
thinking it must be hard for her. But Granny smiled gently and slowly
shook her head.  
“No need. It’s been a long time since I had a guest.”  
Perhaps it had been a long time since Granny had seen anyone. Since
there was a hearth in the garden, she could have gone directly into the
garden, but because I was her first *guest* in a long time, she went out
of her way to welcome me from the front door.  
  
"Would you like to eat this?"  
“Mhm…”  
She gave me some hard dried sweet potato covered in a white powder,
saying it would take a while to prepare the meal. Apparently it would
become soft if roasted over a fire, but I was so nervous I ate it as it
was.  
Granny’s garden had a vegetable patch, just like Jinbei's. Various
vegetables seemed to be planted in small quantities, including sweet
potatoes.  
“Sweet potatoes grow almost anywhere.”  
“I see.”  
The “knowledge” in my mind clicked, and I understood that they were once
famine relief crops.  
She seemed to have harvested and stored a lot of them.  
There were also radishes, leeks, ginger, perilla leaves, komatsuna²,
tomatoes, pumpkins, and Chinese cabbage. In summer, she also grows
ginger and eggplant, and occasionally soybeans and taro.  
I thought it must be hard with so many vegetables.  
"You get used to it."  
She said it’s fine because she’s used to it.  
  
Granny washed small sweet potatoes and radishes in a bucket, peeled
them, and cut them into small pieces.  
She added them to a clay pot she said she had prepared yesterday, placed
it on the stove, and skillfully lit a fire with matches, using dry
leaves and then adding firewood.  
Meanwhile, she chopped up radish leaves and put them in another small
pot that was already boiling, adding the remaining radish sliced into
thin strips.  
Breakfast seemed to be a radish dish, and a delicious aroma began to
fill the air, making my stomach rumble.  
“…Ah”  
“Wait a little longer.”  
Granny laughed at me.  
  
――Cluck――  
  
“…Chickens?”  
Chickens appeared from near the giant tree that had encroached on the
edge of the yard.  
At a glance, there were at least five, but according to Granny, their
numbers fluctuate. They seemed to find their own food, and Granny
occasionally gets some eggs from them.  
Granny finely chopped the scraps of vegetables and scattered them in the
garden, and the chickens ate them happily.  
They also ate the garden pests, and their droppings became fertilizer.  
While I was sitting on the cushion, blankly watching all of this, Granny
continued to work, and before I knew it she had somehow finished making
breakfast.  
  
“I’m sorry, this is all I have.”  
“No! It looks delicious!”  
Breakfast was a radish rice dish with sweet potatoes and finely sliced
radishes. There was also pickled radish and radish leaf miso soup.  
"...Can I eat it?"  
“Please eat as much as you like.”  
“Itadakimasu!”  
Although using chopsticks was still difficult, the first proper meal I
had ever eaten was so warm and delicious that it brought tears to my
eyes.  
“I’ve never eaten rice or miso before…”  
“You can’t get them anymore.”  
“Eh…”  
As I stared at the food in front of me, wondering if it was ok for me to
eat such a precious thing if it’s now unavailable, Granny laughed and
waved her hand.  
“That’s not something for kids to worry about. There isn’t much, but
Granny made it.”  
“Granny did!?”  
  
The rice and miso were both homemade by Granny. Even so, she probably
only had enough for herself, yet she used it for me.  
I knew I shouldn't be shy. I savored Granny’s heartfelt breakfast,
eating every bite carefully.  
That’s why—  
“Thank you for the meal! Granny, it was delicious!"  
I ate every grain of rice.  
“Are you completely full?”  
“Yes! So, is there anything I can do? I can do heavy lifting!"  
When I leaned forward and said so, Granny looked a little surprised,
then broke into a smile.  
“Then, I’ll have you help me, young lady.”  
“Yes!”  
  
I don't know how long I can stay.  
But I decided to do everything I could while I was here.
