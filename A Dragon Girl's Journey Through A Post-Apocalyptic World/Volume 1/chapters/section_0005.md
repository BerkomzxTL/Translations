# 5 A Town With No People

I made my way through the forest. It might not have originally been a
forest, but after years of neglect, it’s become so dense that it’s
impossible to see the end.  
Rustle rustle, crack!  
"Aah, this is so annoying!"  
The forest was full of low bushes, making it unpleasant. My body is
sturdy and my skin doesn’t get scratched easily, so I pushed through the
forest, using my antler spear to slash away the plants brushing against
my legs and stomach.  
  
The location of that research institute was in the suburbs, I think.
Prioritizing width over height, the building was only three stories
tall. Even from the rooftop, I couldn't see very far, so I don't know
how far away those ruined-looking buildings are.  
However, I saw breaks in the forest here and there, and what looked like
roofs, so I decided to head towards those for the time being.  
  
“I’m out…”  
By the time I finished drinking the bottled rainwater, I finally reached
a flat road. But it’s not just any road. It’s hard to see because of the
piles of fallen leaves, but it’s an asphalt road.  
It seems I’m a little higher up here. I could overlook the surrounding
area from the road, and the sight made me feel excited as if I’m really
making progress.  
Tall trees continued on like a forest. Buildings peeked out here and
there, buried within the trees. It seems a long time has passed since
the people left this town that’s been reclaimed by nature.  
  
Instead of going straight, I followed the road. Going up the road felt
like heading towards a mountain, so naturally I went downhill.  
After walking for another hour or so, houses started to appear here and
there. The houses… didn’t seem that old, but the trees were unusually
large, and that slight incongruity made me tilt my head.  
“…What should I do?”  
Clearly, no one lives here. There aren’t any traces of people having
passed through for years, so I feel like it would be okay to go in...  
Clang…  
“The door’s locked, huh…”  
I think there’s no one around… but with locked houses, it’s difficult to
tell if they’re truly abandoned, neglected, or simply unoccupied.  
“Hm hm hm”  
Despite the situation, I prioritized my own feelings and established
rules for my exploration.  
I won't break into obviously habitable houses with locked doors.  
I’ll treat houses with unlocked doors or broken windows as "ruins".  
I'll search for supplies in non-privately owned buildings.  
I’ll freely search for and gratefully use supplies from what I’ve judged
to be ruins.  
If the owner appears, I’ll prostrate myself.  
…That's a pretty rough estimate, but it’ll do, I guess?  
  
With that in mind, I explored the town (?). I thought there weren't many
houses, but the back of the houses turned out to be grassland.  
“Why?”  
I tilted my head at the unnatural sight. After checking several houses
like that, at the tenth or so, I finally found one without a lock.  
“Excuse me~”  
Greetings are important. When I entered, the doors and windows were
properly closed, so no rain was coming in, and the appearance was
clean.  
The living room-like space was littered with belongings; it seems like
they hastily evacuated and couldn’t take everything. Looking around the
room, there were three bedrooms, a Japanese-style room that looked like
a guest room and a living room. A kitchen, a storage room, and a
bathroom; a standard dwelling… or so I thought.  
“Uwa…”  
Even with the windows and doors closed, outside air seems to be coming
through ventilation shafts and vents. Is it that houses deteriorate when
no one lives there? Dust and dirt were caked on, discoloring it in
places, giving it an abandoned feel.  
Even in a proper house, the first floor is no good... If I’m going to
sleep here, the second floor or above would be better.  
  
“For now, let’s search for supplies.”  
I looked around the kitchen and storage room. The refrigerator and
condiments were all gone, everything had turned into a black substance.
The vegetable compartment was half-turned to soil, and the rice
container was full of brown powder and dead bugs.  
There were two large rice bowls stacked on top of each other in the
cupboard, and two smaller rice bowls. The two bowls in the back were
probably for when Grandpa and Grandma came to stay.  
On the counter table separating the living room and kitchen, a happy
family of four—a little boy and girl with their parents—smiled at me
from a photo frame.  
  
In the back of another cupboard, I found unopened salt and dried pasta.
I wonder if I can eat it? But I don't have water to boil it, so I need
to secure drinking water first.  
“Found garbage bags and knives.”  
There were several knives under the sink. I might be able to use them to
cut ingredients. But, even if it were like that time at the research
institute, my own claws are sharper, and can I even cook?  
There was an unopened fifty-pack of 45-liter garbage bags. I’m really
glad; they’ll be useful for all sorts of things. I gathered the things
that seemed usable, lined them up on the living room table, and then
looked for another unlocked house, but there were none.  
But…  
“I’m done with this house…”  
  
I won’t find anything decent anyway, and entering a family's space
without permission... and with dirty feet, it feels a little daunting to
intrude.  
“…Then I don't have to feel bad about this.”  
Crack!  
Without hesitation, I thrust my spear into the gap of a vending machine.
As I put force into it, “heat” gathered in my arms, and the metal lid
bent as the lock twisted off.  
My spoils are many canned juices and some old plastic bottles. The tea
and sports drinks were discolored, but I found water and bottled
carbonated water.  
Since my body can handle eating raw meat and eggshells that may contain
parasites, I feel like I could probably drink water from an old plastic
bottle, but I'd rather boil it.  
“Hmm…”  
Just to be safe, I opened the lid and licked the water. Damn, I have
absolutely no idea.  
And carbonated water is just water, right? It's fizzy, but it's still
water.  
“Uhi~ya!”  
When I tried pouring it over my head, it tingled, and I made a strange
sound.  
  
I checked out some other places, but this area really just seems to be a
residential area; there aren't even any convenience stores, let alone
shops, aside from the vending machine.  
Guuuu…  
“I’m hungry.”  
My stomach rumbled loudly, and I realized I was hungry. I was so excited
about exploring that I didn't notice, but even though I left the
institute early in the morning, it’s almost evening now.  
I have good night vision, but I want to eat while it's still light out.
I said I was done with the house, but I couldn't find any others, so I
went back to borrow a pot.  
Tonight’s menu is spaghetti (old). I have some water, but I don’t have
enough to waste, so I broke the pasta in half, put it in the pot, and
added enough water (old) to cover it.  
“…I should have brought a lighter.”  
I searched the house, but I couldn't find a disposable lighter. If
anyone asks why I didn’t bring a lighter, it’s because I thought I would
find one if I looked in private homes.  
  
I might find one if I search more, but considering the future, being
able to start a fire myself seems better.  
“Is this okay?”  
Withered grass turned to straw, and dry, straight, thin branches. I
found these easily by looking around.  
First, I made a slight dent in the thick branch with my nails. I placed
a peeled thin branch against it and rotated it by rubbing it with my
palm.  
After rotating it over and over again, a little smoke came out. I
hurriedly placed the dry grass on it, but the fire didn't catch. I’ll
try a little more. The smoke kept coming out, but the fire wouldn’t
catch.  
“…Ouch”  
After about thirty minutes, my palm started to hurt. It’s tough, so my
skin hasn’t peeled off, but it’s a little red.  
  
"Maybe..."  
When I killed that giant deer, I released something from my mouth… The
cut surface of the remaining deer leg was burnt… I think. I ate it while
starving, so it’s just a “feeling”, but maybe I can start a fire with
that.  
“Hmmm”  
I’ll try something similar. Back then, I remember I released something
from my mouth by using my body’s “heat” as a “voice”. I’ll try doing the
same thing, holding the branch in front of me, focusing my strength, and
the moment I feel something like "heat," I'll make a "voice."  
“Ah!”  
Poof.  
It worked. But the branch turned into charcoal instantly…  
By the way, I was able to start a fire by using the tingling sensation
in my palm as “heat” and focusing my power as I rotated the branch.  
  
“Boiling.”  
I cooked the pot directly over the fire, making the firewood as flat as
possible.  
“Gyaaaaaaah!”  
It flared up halfway and almost went out, and I had to add water because
it ran out, so it became a mess, but I finally boiled the pasta.  
“It's terrible, ahaha.”  
The spaghetti, which was only salted, was mushy and awful, and so
disgusting that I burst out laughing. This isn't boiling, it's steaming,
isn't it!  
“Ahh, that was awful.”  
Maybe I should have put some wild herbs in it. I guess it wouldn't have
made a difference anyway.  
I sipped slowly on a canned orange juice that has absolutely no
fruitiness, only sweetness, while quietly looking up at the stars.  
“No… people…”  
  
I don't feel lonely even though I'm alone, and I’m not presentable
dressed as I am either, but the thought crossed my mind that there might
be no humans left in this world.  
“Well, that’s about right.”  
This place was originally a place of refuge, so it is what it is.
Besides, I'm traveling to find and discover various things, so I've
decided to abandon the idea of a base and go to various places.  
I put dirt on the smoldering campfire to extinguish it, wiped the soles
of my feet with a towel just in case, and decided to borrow a bed in
what seemed to be a children's room on the second floor and sleep
tonight.  
Good night.  
“…Ugh”  
The fabric of the bed is awful.  
  
Good morning. I couldn’t sleep on the soft futon, so I ended up sleeping
on the roof. The rainy roof felt cleaner than the dusty interior.  
I wet a hand towel with water, wiped my body, poured the remaining water
over my head, and shook my head to flick off the water.  
In the end, I decided to take the salt, the garbage bags, and a small
milk pot from the house. I also put the bottled carbonated water and the
boiled water into plastic bottles, bundled them in a garbage bag, and
carried them in my hand.  
I have no more business here. I should head for the city with the
buildings I saw from the institute. I’ll drink canned juice for calories
to get me there, and then leave this residential area behind.  
  
“Hum hum… ♪”  
While scratching the ground with my spear, I followed the road
half-buried in leaf mold towards the city.  
It's not a journey I'm rushing, really. I spat out a red berry I found
randomly because it was astringent, ate some wild vegetable sprouts as
they were, and as I was walking along doing random things, something
round and rolling suddenly caught my eye.  
“Ah, acorns.”  
Surely, acorns should be edible. When I looked closely, many of them had
fallen, so I decided to go and collect them here. As I went into the
side road and was single-mindedly picking up acorns, I was suddenly
barked at by something.  
  
Bau bau!  
  
…Eh? A dog?
