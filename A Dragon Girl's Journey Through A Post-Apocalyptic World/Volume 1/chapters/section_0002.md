# 2 From An Egg?

"Hmmmmmm...? Hmmm? Hmm? Hm? Hmmm..? Hm?"  
  
\*Bang\*…  
In what seemed to be a lounge within the building, I was gathering
information by reading left behind weekly magazines and other
publications while munching on a snack.  
\*Bang\*…  
From the very beginning, I knew “words” I shouldn't have known. Like a
toddler who had been taught knowledge without ever seeing the actual
objects. “Words” and their “meanings” flowed into my otherwise blank
mind simply from skimming the text in the magazines and books.  
I don't even know who I am. But this is different from typical
“amnesia”.  
\*Bang\*…  
I don’t have many memories of my own experiences. So first, I should
organize my memories by recalling what happened after I defeated the
giant deer.  
  
I was attacked by that giant deer, and after fighting it off in a way
that I don’t quite understand, I was left with severe injuries… or so I
thought. When I woke up from a sudden bout of drowsiness, my wounds were
healed.  
No, that's not quite right. My wounds were all covered and sealed by
slightly blackened red scales.  
Scales? Why scales? When I unconsciously rubbed them with my hand, the
scales peeled off easily from the black parts, leaving my reddish-tan
skin without a single scar.  
At that moment, I was hit by a sudden intense wave of hunger and ate the
remaining deer legs.  
I wonder…? Did I heal because I ate meat…maybe?  
  
At that time, my hands also seemed to be covered in red scales, but now
my nails and hands are back to normal.  
  
There are so many things I don't understand, not just about my own body,
but also the excessively large deer that suddenly attacked me, and the
ruins of buildings that I could see beyond the forest.  
  
I had many concerns, but I first wanted to clean my body, which was
dirty with dust and dried blood.  
I saw a water tank on the roof, but I didn't think there was any water
left in it. Even if there was, a water tank in a ruined building would
likely be in worse condition than the Sea of Decay¹, so I immediately
gave up on that idea.  
The door to the roof was locked, but there was a window, so I broke it
using the giant deer's antler to get inside.  
The broken antler is about my height, and I realized once again just how
unrealistically huge the deer was.  
I think deer antlers branch out as they age, so the owner of this
straight antler must have been young, which is probably why I could
defeat it.  
Well, even though I broke it off, it's as hard as steel, so I thought I
could use it as a spear and decided to take it with me.  
  
The rooms inside the building had strange tools and machines, giving it
the feel of a laboratory or research facility. I don't know how much
time has passed since this place was abandoned, but even the few
remaining laptops were dead, their batteries completely drained.  
Judging from the state of disrepair and the things left behind, it seems
that… this place wasn't a company that went bankrupt and became a ruin,
but rather a facility that had to be abandoned due to some
circumstances.  
  
It’s a fairly large building, but luckily I found emergency supplies in
a storeroom-like area.  
But most of the cardboard boxes had already been opened, which gave me a
bad feeling. Upon investigation, I found that the boxes were empty, as
if they had been taken when the place was abandoned.  
It seems like I had luck, or maybe it was bad luck. Or perhaps they were
too heavy to carry? There was a large quantity of bottled water in
unopened cardboard boxes.  
…Can I drink it? It looked clean because it was in the cardboard boxes,
but I don't know how many years have passed, and it might be dangerous
to drink it as is….  
But well, it felt a bit late to worry about that now, considering I'd
eaten questionable things and raw deer legs. Until things get really
desperate, I'll refrain from using this for anything else and liberally
poured it over my head to wash my body.  
I had also found paper towels in a restroom along the way, so I scraped
off the bloodstains with them and rinsed them off with water, and
finally I felt clean and refreshed.  
  
I've decided against drinking the water as is for now, but it's not just
a matter of preference; I actually have something else to drink.  
I didn't see any other buildings visible from the rooftop, so I thought
there must be something, and I found "it" in what seemed to be a lounge
room, and here I am now.  
  
\*Bang\*...  
"I guess this is all I can read..."  
I tossed the last medical journal into an 18-liter can I found in the
storeroom and leaned back into the sofa.  
As I read the magazines and books in the lounge, it grew completely
dark, and only the sound of me munching on snacks and magazines burning
in the can echoed quietly.  
Perhaps due to a part of my body growing, the anxiety and impatience I
felt when I woke up has disappeared, and I’m surprisingly calm. I think
“humans” live in groups, but I feel that this isn’t the case for "me."  
I was able to "reconcile" some general knowledge, but in the end I
couldn't find the answer to who "I" am. All I know is that this place
seems to have been a pharmaceutical company's research institute,
conducting research on living organisms. And that “I” was a research
subject... that's my only conclusion.  
Then, some kind of disaster must have occurred, and all the staff
evacuated, and several years have passed since then.  
  
With a "thud," I stood up from the sofa and took a canned juice from the
vending machine that I had pried open, leaving my antler spear stuck in
it. I opened the can and poured it down my throat. At first, I couldn’t
get used to the fizzy feeling, but in the end I gave in to the
temptation of sweetness.  
I'm counting on this vending machine. The contents may be past their
expiration date, but I feel better knowing it's in a can. Canned food is
probably fine too.  
Finding this lounge room early was lucky. There was still a usable
disposable lighter in the smoking room, and there were books and a
vending machine.  
Half the vending machine had paper cups, so the contents were
questionable, but on the other hand, the other half of it was in cans,
so I decided to just consider myself lucky.  
Thinking such things, I returned to the sofa and sat down with another
"thud."  
  
I don't fit in with humans who live in groups. There's a reason why I
think that.  
The women's restroom where I found the paper towels was much larger than
the men's restroom, with a vanity and a full-length mirror.  
After finding water and washing my entire body, I was finally able to
get a good look at my appearance, and I was shocked by the changes.  
  
First of all, I’m definitely not Japanese. I don't know what country I'm
from, but I don't think I belong to any race. Well, my reddish-tan skin
was already a clue, but my voluminous, curly hair that reached my
shoulders is a reddish-silver, like cherry blossoms.  
My age is somewhere between the early and mid-teens? My eyes are golden
and slightly upturned, cat-like, but my facial features aren't bad, I
think… or maybe I don't know. I'm not tall, my whole body is slender,
and my chest and waist are modest, but my arms and legs are long, so I
think my proportions are balanced.  
What surprised me was the changes in my body.  
The small “tail” above my butt that I first noticed had grown to thirty
centimeters and is about as thick as my wrist. It’s covered in fine red
scales for some reason.  
And “horns”! At first, the horns were small and only slightly
protruding, but now they’ve become a translucent, rose crystal-like
color and have grown to about ten centimeters.  
They're definitely not human features, right? Normally people don't have
horns or tails or scales, right? My teeth are a normal white, but my
canines are so sharp they could be called “fangs”, so they really aren't
"normal" anymore.  
The tail is incredibly annoying when I sit down, but I've given up and
just sit with the stiff tail stuck into the sofa.  
Well, the horns are growing backward from the sides of my head, so they
aren't that much of a bother, and they look like red jewels, so I kind
of like them.  
I wonder why it turned out like this...  
  
\*Bang\*…  
I chewed on a snack and washed it down with a carbonated drink. The
"snack" is the capsule I ate first when I woke up… never mind, it was an
egg, right? I was born from that egg, right?  
Why? What's going on?!  
Am I an egg-laying animal?! Even though I'm an egg-laying animal, I have
a belly button?! Am I a platypus?!  
\*Snap\*...!  
I unconsciously got excited and crushed the eggshell with my fangs.  
  
I don't understand why I have the intelligence to think normally even
though I've just been born, but apparently some creatures eat their
eggshells as their first source of nutrition, so I assumed that was the
case and decided to eat the whole thing.  
Honestly, it's not tasty, and it's as hard as a rock, but I have nothing
else to eat, so there's nothing I can do.  
  
That’s because I haven’t found anything that looks like food yet.  
I didn’t expect there to be no cafeteria or store selling food in the
building, let alone emergency supplies.  
It seems that my body has incredibly poor fuel efficiency. I ate four
huge deer legs, which were bigger than me, but I'm still hungry. So I'm
making do with canned juice and eggshells, but if I have to do this
tomorrow too, I’ll be in serious trouble.  
In the first place, where did all that food go? I ate four legs, each
clearly larger than my body volume, right?  
Did I consume it to heal my injured body? Did I need a huge amount of
food because I was so badly injured? …I really hope that's the case.  
  
"……I'm going to sleep."  
I'm tired, and so much has happened that I'll put off thinking and
investigating for now…  
I can see fairly well at night, but it's so dark that I'm sure I'll miss
something.  
I decided to explore the rest of the building tomorrow, and after eating
the last bit of the eggshell, I curled up on the sofa and fell asleep.  
In the can, where the fire began to die out, the remaining embers
crackled softly.  
I have no hope, and there are so many things I don't understand, but
I'll wish for something good to happen tomorrow… I offered a small
prayer to the moon visible through the window, reflected in my half-open
eyes.  
  
Good night.
