# Chapter 46: The Dark Swordsman

"Here's the exit."  
  
Asain pointed to the exit, but Aoi and Hisui looked displeased.  
  
"There's someone strong there."  
"Yes, I feel an ominous presence."  
"Hisui, take Asain and get in contact with the Intelligence Division. No
matter what... I'll open a breakthrough."  
"But..."  
  
As if to cover up what Hisui was about to say,  
  
"I want to put a stop the cult's movement. Please, Hisui. Listen to my
selfishness."  
  
Hisui swallowed the words she wanted to say and replied.  
  
"Understood. Let's definitely meet at The Whimsy."  
"Got it. Well, I'm going!"  
  
Hisui rammed the mini-lems into the exit door. The door was crushed and
blown away. At that moment, the mini-lems were burned and blown away.  
  
"Aoi, be careful! It's the swordsman I met with the cursed sword!"  
  
Aoi resisted the force and jumped out of the exit. A tremendous blast of
wind hit her. However, Aoi's resistance was not broken.  
Aoi rushed towards the swordsman and unsheathed Nijimaru in one motion,
slashing from above.  
  
"De ya!!"  
  
A spirited shout! However, the attack was blocked by the cursed sword,
Magicule Eater. Blade clashed against blade, scattering eerie sparks.  
  
"Buenos!"  
"Aoi, is that you!!"  
  
Aoi gathered magicules in her right hand and fired it at Buenos.
Countless arrows of light came charging at him.  
  
"!"  
  
Buenos swung his cursed sword and devoured all the magicules of the
arrows of light with the sword. However, Aoi used that moment to get
into Buenos' range and slammed Nijimaru, charged with magicules as a
blade of light, into Buenos' torso. Buenos was blown away and slammed
into the ground.  
  
"Hisui, now! Get out!"  
  
Hisui created a golem, mowed down the soldiers surrounding them, and ran
through with Asain.  
  
"Aoi, I'll be waiting!"  
  
Aoi nodded to the words and faced Buenos. Buenos slowly stood up.  
  
(He won't be defeated by something like this.)  
  
"It’s been a while, Buenos. Has your appearance gotten worse because of
the cursed sword?"  
"Perhaps. After I received the dark sword, I became a monster, not a
human. I live in a different world from you, who has magicules sealed
away. It's only natural that my appearance changes."  
"I haven't sealed the dark magicules. They've just fallen asleep. If the
dark magicules awaken, I might become a resident of the same world as
Buenos."  
"I wanted to capture Hisui, but it'll be difficult with you here. But
it's a blessing in disguise. I'll have you die here and take Dark
Cutter."  
  
Buenos infused his “magicules” into Magicule Eater and slashed at Aoi.
Aoi parried the cursed sword with Nijimaru, but her magicules were
stolen, and she felt dizzy.  
  
(Damn, that's troublesome.)  
  
Aoi jumped back and moved out of Buenos' range. At that moment, soldiers
fired arrows at her. Aoi knocked down the arrows with Nijimaru and
created a lightning strike with her right hand, slamming it into the
soldiers. The lightning spread, and three soldiers fell. However, Buenos
took advantage of the gap that was created. Buenos created a flame in
his left hand and aimed it at Aoi. The flame was released from Buenos
like a snake, entangling around Aoi's right leg. Aoi immediately
resisted and extinguished the flame, but she felt a sharp pain in her
right leg.  
  
(There's no time to heal.)  
  
Aoi returned Nijimaru to its scabbard and took an iai stance. She poured
magicules into Nijimaru. And,  
  
"Uooooh!"  
  
She drew Nijimaru with a spirited shout. The torrent of light released
from Nijimaru became a blade and approached Buenos.  
  
(Even the Magicule Eater can't absorb it all!)  
  
Buenos judged that to be the case. He charged Magicule Eater with
magicules and struck the blade of light. The blade of light collided
with Magicule Eater, becoming countless particles of light and
bursting.  
The particles of light rained down on the surroundings, and the soldiers
surrounding them were pierced through their armor or had their heads
crushed and died.  
Buenos, too, was also unable to completely deflect the blade of light.
The particles of light attacked Buenos, tearing his body apart. It
wasn’t a fatal wound, but Buenos could barely stand.  
  
"As expected of you, Aoi."  
  
Aoi was also stained with blood from the particles of light. Especially
her right leg, burned by Buenos, looked especially painful.  
  
"Buenos, I'm sorry, but I can't die here. I'm going to pass through."  
  
Aoi drew Dark Cutter and wrapped herself in darkness by pouring
magicules into it. Buenos could no longer see Aoi.  
  
"With those injuries, she won't be able to go far. She's running out of
magicules. She won't be able to heal either."  
  
Buenos slowly started walking and spoke to the surviving soldiers.  
  
"Contact Dista. Hunt down Aoi."
