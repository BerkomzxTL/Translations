# Chapter 55: The Marquis Recapture Operation

"Why is Arcadia the squad leader?"  
"Yes! Including myself, 10 people have been seconded to the Intelligence
Division! We are assigned here as the Intelligence Division, not as
members of the Royal Guard!"  
  
Aoi smiled wryly at Arcadia's crisp response and looked back at Hisui.  
  
"If it's the Intelligence Division, it's okay to recapture Marquis
Barlmin without being noticed, right?"  
"Yes, I think that's right."  
"Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. I know the location of Marquis Barlmin."  
"Mr. Elliot, where is he?"  
"Yes, on the 3rd floor of Marquis Barlmin's mansion, in the Marquis'
office."  
  
Aoi and Hisui both felt something was off.  
  
"Mr. Elliot, isn't the timing of finding the location a little too good,
no matter how you look at it?"  
"It's the power of our Intelligence Division! Is what I’d like to say,
but we feel that way too."  
"Hmm, it must be a trap. Buenos is good at engraving magic. We should
assume there’s some kind of trick involved."  
  
Aldey groaned as he looked at Aoi.  
  
"Lady Aoi, who is this gentleman?"  
"Ah, I haven't introduced you to Arcadia yet. This is Aldey, the Dragon
Knight of the Six Heroes."  
"Arcadia, I'm Aldey. Nice to meet you."  
  
Arcadia prostrated himself, his eyes darting back and forth in
surprise.  
Aldey glanced at Arcadia's reaction before turning back to Aoi.  
  
"I won't be much of a fighting force. I can't fight for a long time, so
I'll just be a burden to you. Aoi, how will you attack?"  
"I think Buenos' ultimate target is Hisui. So I'd like to go to the
place where the Marquis is being held alone. I'd like to ask everyone,
including Hisui, for support..."  
  
Aoi was being glared at intensely by Hisui.  
  
"Okay. Alright, Hisui. Let's rescue the Marquis together. Mr. Elliot,
please draw a detailed diagram of the Marquis' mansion."  
  
Elliot drew a floor plan of the Marquis' mansion on a large desk with
chalk.  
  
"Arcadia and Mr. Asain will form two squads. Each squad will infiltrate
two locations, the main entrance and here, the service entrance to the
kitchen. One squad will make a showy entry at the front to lure in the
enemy soldiers. The other squad will secure the service entrance. Hisui
and I will take advantage of the commotion at the front to break through
this window, which is close to the Marquis' office, and infiltrate. Once
we secure the Marquis, we will escape to the service entrance as quickly
as possible, so the other squad will retreat with the Marquis. Hisui and
I will take the rear guard. In the final phase, I’ll launch a ball of
light into the sky, so be sure to retreat when you see that signal."  
  
Aoi looked around at everyone and continued.  
  
"Once the squads are formed, we'll begin the recapture!"
