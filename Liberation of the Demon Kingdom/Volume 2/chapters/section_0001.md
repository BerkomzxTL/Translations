# Chapter 30: To the Barlmin Territory

**Volume 2: The Barlmin Territory**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
From that day on, Hisui started to laugh more often. She was still cold
to those who tried to flirt with Aoi, but she would talk and laugh with
the members of the caravan.  
  
"Mr. Onjin, Hisui’s brightened up a bit. I wonder if the tension has
eased a little..."  
  
"Yes, it seems so. Our young ones also seem to be enjoying themselves,
so that's good. Especially Jim, I think he thinks of Hisui as some kind
of goddess, doesn't he?"  
"Certainly..."  
"I think we'll be able to enter Barlmin territory around lunchtime
today. I guess you could say we've completed half of our journey. It's
already painful to think about parting with you two even though there's
still half left."  
"That's true."  
"How is Gam doing? Is he showing signs of growth as a user?"  
"That kid has the skills of a swordsman who could be considered E-Rank,
but he can't control his magicules. He has a high capacity, so I think
he'll become quite strong if he learns how to control them."  
  
In fact, Gam was working hard. As Aoi told him to, he was constantly
using wind magic to float paper above his head. This is a training
exercise that requires him to control his magicules in small amounts.
Wind magic has strong aspects as a support technique. It requires
delicate control of magicules for things like soundproofing, defending
against arrows, searching, and communicating voices to distant
locations.

The caravan arrived at the checkpoint separating the royal territory and
Barlmin territory before noon. Nothing happened when leaving the royal
territory, but when entering Barlmin territory, Aoi was stopped by
soldiers at the checkpoint. They said that it was improper for her to
possess a magic sword at D-Rank. It was a complete fabrication.  
  
"We have received special orders from His Majesty Berg. Hasn't a
notification been sent?"  
  
Hisui tried to negotiate, but the soldiers’ attitude did not change.
Later, the disturbance was resolved by intervention from the royal
territory side, but both Aoi and Hisui felt uneasy. They decided to stay
at a post town immediately after passing the checkpoint, but even here,
Aoi and Hisui felt something was off.  
  
"The whole town is tense."  
"Aoi, do you think so too? It's an unpleasant atmosphere."  
"I wonder if Mr. Onjin has any information."  
  
Aoi went to Onjin, and Onjin spoke to Aoi first.  
  
"Miss Aoi. We’re going to stay at this inn, but what do you think?"  
  
It seemed they wanted to decide on an inn with a large room.  
  
"I had the young guys gather information, and it seems that kidnappings,
especially of children, have been happening for the past few months. The
soldiers at the checkpoint earlier were also suspicious. I know young
ladies probably don't like large rooms, but I thought it would be safer
to stick with a large group."  
"Mr. Onjin. Thank you. But today Hisui and I will stay together. It'll
be easier to move around that way."  
  
Aoi thought that if anything were to happen, they would be the target,
so it was a consideration not to involve Onjin and the others.  
  
"I understand. I hope nothing happens, but please be careful."  
"It's okay. After all, I'll have A-Rank knight Hisui with me."
