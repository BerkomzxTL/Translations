# Chapter 35: Aoiâ€™s Magicules

"I became unable to use dark magicules after dispelling the curse on the
Sugal Plains."  
"Is it because you transferred the dark magicules to me?"  
  
Aoi shook her head helplessly.  
  
"I don't know. But the amount of magicules I transferred to Hisui was
about 1/3. For several years, I was allowed to recuperate in a rural
town in the Bram territory."  
"Did you run out of magicules? But Aoi, you can use light magicules,
right? Why were you recuperating?"  
  
Aoi stood up and looked up at the sky.  
  
"I told you before that Luke didn't age, right? I'm the same. I don't
age either. But when I can't use dark magicules, the balance of
magicules collapses and there's a reaction. Using light magic drains my
life force. So, I was recuperating to regain dark magicules."  
  
Hisui shook off the unpleasant thoughts swirling in her head and
asked.  
  
"But you're okay now, right? Aoi, you were using dark magic, weren't
you?"  
  
Aoi shook her head weakly.  
  
"No, the reason I could use dark magic was because of the power of this
Dark Cutter. This sword converts magicules into pure darkness. That's
why I could use dark attacks even with my light magicules."  
"But."  
"It's okay. It's not like I'll die immediately just because I used light
magicules. Besides, I can't die until I liberate the sins of the Demon
God of Chaos."  
  
Hisui punched Aoi in the chest.  
  
"Who is Aoi? Aoi is Aoi! Not the Demon God of Chaos! You don't need to
bear those sins. Don't say things that make you sound like you're
rushing to die."  
  
Hisui's face was covered in tears and snot.  
Aoi gently hugged Hisui.  
  
"Hisui, I'm sorry. I was a little weak."  
  
Aoi peered into Hisui's face.  
  
"You look terrible..."  
"Whose fault is that?"  
"Yeah. Sorry."  
  
Hisui stepped away from Aoi, took a deep breath, and then said.  
  
"Let's get your dark magic back. Half of Aoi's suffering is mine. So!"  
"Yeah, I look forward to working with you in the future, Hisui."  
  
Hisui wiped away her tears and hugged Aoi back.  
  
"Aoi, let's interrogate that knight first. Apparently, we're heinous
criminals who kidnap children."
