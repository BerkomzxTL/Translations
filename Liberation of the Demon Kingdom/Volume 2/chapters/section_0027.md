# Chapter 56: Arcadia's Determination

The setting sun illuminated the capital in a deep red light. A 10-member
knight order led by Arcadia was positioned in front of the Marquis'
mansion's main entrance, and 5 Intelligence Division members led by
Asain were positioned behind the Marquis' mansion.  
  
"Alright, we'll start once Arcadia makes a move."  
  
Aoi and Hisui were positioned on the side of the Marquis' mansion.  
And soon there was a commotion at the front.  
  
"I am Arcadia, a B-Rank knight from the Intelligence Division. I have
urgent business with Marquis Barlmin and have come to see him. I request
an audience!"  
  
Arcadia presented his pass.  
  
"I am Orb, an A-Rank knight of the Barlmin territory, and the leader of
the knight order. I am currently awaiting instructions, so please wait a
moment."  
"No, due to the urgent nature of my business, I must proceed."  
  
Arcadia pushed past Orb and was about to enter the Marquis' mansion when
Dista appeared.  
  
"Marquis Barlmin is busy. I will listen to your request instead as the
acting lord."  
"No, the name Dista has been officially removed from the list of next
lord candidates. Therefore, I cannot recognize you as a representative!
Step aside!"  
"Everyone is just getting in my way! Orb, don't hold back! Cut them
down!"  
  
Orb made eye contact with the knight order and drew his sword. Arcadia's
team also drew their swords after confirming that Orb had drawn his.  
  
"Freyr! Scan the mansion!"  
  
Arcadia instructed the wind user to scan the Marquis' mansion.  
  
"Yes."  
  
Arcadia swung his sword, protecting Freyr, who was beginning to gather
wind magic.  
  
"The vanguard should go outside and fight. Rearguard block the passage
to the office!"  
Orb gave instructions to the knight order, fearing that the children's
presence would be detected by wind magic.  
  
"Anyone! Kill that wind user!"  
  
Following Orb's instructions, magical attacks focused on Freyr. However,
Arcadia and the other team members deployed resistance, protecting
Freyr.  
  
"Freyr, are you ready yet?"  
"Yes, well, this is..."  
"Freyr!"  
"Small... children? There are 15 children in the mansion. They're
positioned to surround the office. There's a reaction believed to be the
Marquis in the office!"  
"Children...!"  
  
Arcadia felt the superiority of engraving magic as a user on a daily
basis. Therefore, he had studied engraving magic, which involved laying
down magic circles. Why were children being placed there? Arcadia could
only come to one conclusion.  
  
"Are they going to use them as magicules for engraving magic!"  
  
Arcadia was furious. He had a strong sense of justice. He didn't know
what kind of technique the engraving magic used, but to sacrifice
children!  
  
"Rescue the children! Break through the rearguard! Three of you come
with me! I'm entrusting command to Vice Squad Leader Dogos!"  
  
Arcadia's reaction was unacceptable to Orb. He immediately chased after
Arcadia.  
  
(I'll sandwich him with the rearguard!)  
  
But Arcadia, burning with a sense of justice, was strong. After breaking
through the rearguard, he dashed down the passage. The three
Intelligence Division members held back the rearguard to prevent them
from chasing Arcadia.  
  
"I won't let you!"  
  
Orb pursued Arcadia in an attempt to hide their shameful actions. Orb
slipped past the Intelligence Division members and fired an arrow of
light at Arcadia. The arrow pierced Arcadia's right shoulder. But
Arcadia didn't stop. He ran all the way to the room where the children
were likely to be. Arcadia cut through the door with a blade of light
and entered. There, the children were imprisoned in cages. Large magic
stones were embedded in the floor of the cages, and Arcadia understood
what that meant.  
  
(Engraving magic has been applied to the mansion after all! Are they
going to extract magicules from those cages!)  
  
"Stay back a little. I'll get you out of there now."  
  
Arcadia infused his sword with magicules and tried to cut the iron bars
of the cage.  
  
"What?"  
  
Arcadia was slashed in the back by Orb and fell.  
  
"Stay here quietly!"  
  
Dista, who had suddenly appeared in the room, placed a magicule-sealing
shackle on Arcadia's left hand, fixing the other to the iron bars of the
cage.  
  
"Hah, serves you right. You'll have your magicules extracted here
too!"  
  
Seeing this, Orb called out to Dista.  
  
"Lord Dista, this place is dangerous. Let's get out of the mansion."  
  
Dista and Orb glanced at Arcadia and left the room.  
  
"B, big brother..."  
"It's okay. I'll somehow save you."  
  
(If things continue like this, not only the Marquis but also Miss Hisui,
who is heading for the office, will be in danger. Arcadia! Make a
decision!)  
  
Arcadia encouraged himself, raised the sword in his right hand, and cut
off his left hand along with the magicule-sealing shackle.  
Then, infusing magicules into his sword, he cut down the iron bars.
