# Chapter 43: Changing Clothes

"Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. This way."  
  
Asain stopped by a farmhouse before entering the capital.  
  
"Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui are quite conspicuous. Well, you attract
attention... This place is provided by our collaborator and we have
various equipment hidden here. I'd appreciate it if you could change
into inconspicuous clothes before entering the capital... Well then,
I'll wait outside."  
  
—  
  
Aoi and Hisui rummaged through the women's clothing and chose clothes
that looked like something a merchant's daughter might wear.  
Aoi took off the clothes she was wearing, and once she was down to her
underwear, she fastened the dagger she received from Berg to her waist
with a belt.  
  
"Alright, if I put on a jacket, you won't be able to tell from the
outside, right?"  
  
Hisui couldn't take her eyes off Aoi, who was fastening a dagger while
only in her underwear.  
  
(What a clean and beautiful body. It's muscular, yet still feminine...
I’d like to try making a nude statue of Aoi someday. I wonder if Aoi
would get angry...?)  
  
"What's wrong? Hisui."  
"N-nothing at all."  
  
Aoi approached Hisui still in her underwear and unfastened the clasp of
the magical breastplate that Hisui was wearing.  
  
"Hisui, your face is bright red. What's wrong? Let's change quickly."  
"Y-yes."  
  
Hisui tried to change quickly, but she was flustered and cut her finger
with the clasp Aoi had unfastened.  
  
"Ouch."  
"Ah, Hisui is so clumsy."  
  
Aoi put Hisui's cut left index finger in her mouth.  
  
"W-wait, Aoi."  
"It's okay. Healing."  
  
Aoi performed Healing while holding Hisui's finger in her mouth, healing
the wound. Hisui's heart was pounding from the sensation of Aoi's lips
and the tip of her tongue on her index finger.  
  
"Alright, Hisui. I’ll get you changed."  
  
Aoi said that and unbuttoned Hisui's shirt. As she did so, Aoi's
fingertips touched Hisui's chest.  
  
"Ah!"  
  
Hisui couldn't help but let out a voice at the unexpected sensation.  
  
"What is it, Hisui? Did you feel something?"  
  
Aoi looked at Hisui with a mischievous expression.  
  
"I-it's Aoi's fault! It's because Aoi has such a beautiful body! My
heart was pounding and I made a weird noise!"  
"Fufu. Hisui, you're hopeless. Then next time we take a bath together,
you can take a look."  
  
Hisui nodded with a bright red face.  
  
"Well then, change quickly. We'll keep Asain waiting."
