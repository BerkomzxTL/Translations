# Chapter 63: Let’s Choose a Dress

When the two of them went to The Whimsy's dining hall, drunk men were
collapsed everywhere. Aoi began to cast healing magic on them one by
one. The men, recovered from their hangovers, revered Aoi like a
goddess.  
  
"Mr. Elliot, we're going to the Marquis' mansion now. Take care of the
rest."  
  
On the way to the Marquis' mansion, Hisui kept glaring at Aoi. Her body
felt hot the entire time.  
  
(It's all Aoi's fault. Because of Aoi, my body feels like it's going
crazy...)  
  
"Hisui. What kind of dress shou...ld I wear..."  
  
When Aoi turned to Hisui, she noticed that Hisui was glaring at her.  
  
"Wh-What? What's wrong?"  
"Nothing!"  
  
Hisui answered as she averted her eyes from Aoi.  
  
"Hehe. I see."  
  
Aoi peeked at Hisui's face and grinned.  
  
"Oh well. I'll pamper you after tomorrow's party, Hisui."  
"Eh! Really?"  
  
Aoi's heart skipped a beat at Hisui's cuteness as she looked up at Aoi
with upturned eyes.  
  
"Y-yeah."  
"Aoi, it's a promise, okay? Come on, let's go to the Marquis' mansion
quickly."  
  
Aoi was confused, wondering if Hisui had misunderstood what "pamper"
meant.  
  
(Um... I was just going to pat her head. Huh??)  
  
—  
  
The Marquis' mansion still bore traces of the battle from the other day,
but it had mostly been cleaned up and was gradually returning to
normal.  
  
"Lady Aoi, Miss Hisui. Welcome."  
  
Marquis Barlmin greeted them immediately, and behind the Marquis, a line
of maids were kneeling respectfully.  
  
"Welcome to the Barlmin residence."  
"Thank you for having us."  
"Please, this way."  
  
Aoi and Hisui were led by the head maid to a room filled with dresses.
Hisui was overwhelmed by the sheer variety.  
  
"Aoi."  
  
Hisui timidly tugged at Aoi's sleeve.  
  
"I'm just a country bumpkin and don't really know what to do, so could
you choose for me, Aoi?"  
"Eh! Really? That makes me so excited!"  
  
Hisui was made to try on various dresses. Each time, Aoi and the maids
cheered, making Hisui feel itchy.  
  
"Try this one on, and this one too."  
"Cute!!"  
  
It was three hours later when Hisui was finally released from Aoi and
the maids.  
  
(That was harder than the Knights' training...)  
  
In the end, Aoi chose a blue dress that boldly exposed her shoulders and
chest. Hisui chose a daring emerald green dress that revealed her legs
all the way up to her thighs.
