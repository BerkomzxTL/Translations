# Chapter 39: The Knights of Barlmin

"Why is the Knights Order heading to the royal capital? That's not what
we agreed on!"  
"Maintaining order within the territory is our job. We have a duty to
report the current situation to the royal capital!"  
"I see. So you're saying you'll ignore orders from Lord Dista? Perfect.
Hey, bring that thing over here!"  
  
The sound of rushing footsteps could be heard, mixed with a roar.  
  
"Ogre!"  
  
"Aoi!"  
"Onjin, please wait here for a bit. Gam, stay alert! Run away
immediately if something happens."  
"Kamo, can you run over there?"  
"Piyo."  
  
With a cry, Kamo carried Aoi and Hisui away.  
  
—  
  
There were 5 knights and 10 bandits. The Knights Order's squad leader
was B-Rank, with 2 others being C-Rank. It was a lineup that couldn’t
lose. Normally.  
  
"T-This ogre is strong."  
  
The Knights Order couldn't lay a hand on the ogre swinging its club. And
then,  
  
"The magicules are being absorbed into the sword! The magic’s
disappearing."  
  
One of the bandits had a magic sword.  
The Knights Order gradually grew weary. Their magic was completely
nullified by the magic sword, and the knights' swords were crushed by
the ogre's overwhelming power.  
  
"Move, move!"  
  
Suddenly a voice was heard, and a whip-like, freely transforming magic
passed over the Knights Order's heads. The magic caught the ogre, but
didn't inflict much damage.  
  
"Aoi, that ogre isn't normal!"  
"It looks like its mind and body are being manipulated by dark magic."  
"Then!"  
  
Hisui drew her Yagiri and slashed at the ogre. The Yagiri that Hisui
swung cut off the ogre's arm holding the club, but vein-like tentacles
burst out from the cut of the arm, reattaching the arm and restoring it
to its original state.  
  
"No way."  
  
Hisui couldn’t help but mutter. The ogre swung its club with its
restored arm. Hisui dodged the attack with a cartwheel and returned to
Aoi's side.  
  
"Hisui, that's a nasty magic… It's being forcibly kept alive."  
"Indeed."  
"I am Asain, a B-Rank knight of the Barlmin territory. I appreciate your
assistance."  
  
One of the knights stood in front of Aoi and Hisui, holding his sword.  
  
"That ogre won't die! And magic is nullified by my magic sword! What a
problem. And the Knights Order is weak, too weak!!"  
  
The bandit with the cursed sword taunted a heavily injured knight,
stabbing him in the chest with the cursed sword.  
  
"Gah. Squad leader! Retreat now!"  
"Th, that guy!"  
"..."  
  
Aoi silently infused magicules into Nijimaru and swung it. The magicules
infused into the sword became light and decapitated the bandit.  
  
"!!"  
  
Aoi, still wielding Nijimaru, rushed to the ogre's feet and with a
single flash, cut through the ogre's torso. Tentacles intertwined to try
to reconnect the ogre, but Aoi swung her sword again and cut them off as
well. Then she swung her sword repeatedly until the tentacles could no
longer connect the torso. Again and again.  
  
"I'm sorry…"  
  
Aoi silently bowed to the unmoving ogre and then looked around.  
  
"If you don't want to die, surrender."  
  
The voice was quiet, but overwhelmed the bandits with pressure.
Confirming that the bandits had discarded their weapons, Aoi rushed to
the knight who had been stabbed by the cursed sword and cast healing on
him.  
  
"Good. I made it in time."  
  
Aoi was relieved to see the knight's wound closing.
