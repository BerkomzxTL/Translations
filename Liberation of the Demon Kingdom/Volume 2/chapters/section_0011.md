# Chapter 40: What Does SSS Rank Mean?

Hisui picked up the cursed sword and gazed at its blade.  
  
"This cursed sword, it's a copy of the original."  
"Yeah, it's a sword that gives off a very unpleasant feeling. I wonder
if it's imitating Magicule Eater...?"  
  
Aoi looked at the cursed sword with disgust.  
  
"The creation of cursed swords is one thing, but even duplicating one
requires an imprint by a user of that attribute. Could there be a user
of darkness?"  
  
"Um, thank you very much for this time. I am Asain, a B-Rank knight from
the Barlmin territory."  
  
Asain bowed deeply to Aoi and Hisui. Hisui, feeling humbled by Asain's
politeness, returned the bow.  
  
"I am Hisui, an A-Rank knight from the Asura Kingdom Intelligence
Division."  
  
Hisui said, showing her pass to Asain. Aoi faced Asain as she was.  
  
"I'm Aoi."  
  
Aoi also took out a pass with a cherry blossom crest and showed it to
Asain. Asain looked apologetic and said,  
  
"I'm sorry. I don't know what this is? I lack the knowledge, I'm sorry.
But I can tell from your swordsmanship and magic that you are someone of
high standing."  
  
Aoi nodded and looked at Asain.  
  
"What's going on in the Barlmin territory? The bandits had a magic
sword. I can't be sure until I investigate..."  
  
Aoi said, looking back at Hisui.  
  
"Yes, I believe this cursed sword is a replica of one that was held by a
swordsman of the Order of Chaos, who were active in the Mars
territory."  
"Actually, we were also attacked by a group with replicas in the royal
capital. There was an attack even after entering the Barlmin territory.
A C-Rank knight from the Barlmin territory was in command at that
time."  
  
Aoi showed the knight's pass she had picked up to Asain.  
  
"Jules, huh...? He's a very impulsive man."  
  
Asain sighed and began to speak slowly.  
  
"Since the Battle of Sugal Plains three years ago, a group hostile to
the Demon Kingdom has been rising in power."  
"That's right. I heard that Berg was strengthening crackdowns."  
  
Asain was surprised by Aoi calling the King by his first name in his
mind, but he continued without showing it on his face.  
  
"Yes, I hear that it's not much of a problem in the royal capital and
most territories. However, it’s different in the Barlmin territory. It
originally borders the Great Forest and has many monsters. There’s a lot
of damage caused by the monsters. They preached about the threat of
monsters, and their power grew."  
"Marquis Barlmin isn't someone who would tolerate such a thing,
right?"  
"Yes, Marquis Barlmin was commanding the extermination of such forces...
However, a month ago, the current lord, Dista, suddenly advocated the
expulsion of the Demon Kingdom and began the expulsion of demi-humans
together with the knights under his command. Marquis Barlmin was furious
and severely scolded Lord Dista, ordering him to stay confined. However,
three days later, Marquis Barlmin suddenly absconded..."  
"Wait a minute."  
  
Aoi interrupted Asain's story and asked.  
  
"He ran away...? It sounds like Dista's doing, doesn't it?"  
"Yes. We're also convinced of that. Lord Dista took control and issued
martial law in the capital. All knights except those under Lord Dista's
command had their knightly authority revoked, making it impossible for
them to move. We were trying to escape the territory’s capital to inform
His Majesty Berg of this situation when we were caught in battle."  
Aoi nodded and said while looking into Asain's eyes.  
  
"I understand the story. Mr. Asain, I am an SSS-Rank knight of the Asura
Kingdom Intelligence Division. I would like to help if I can."  
  
"SSS-Rank...? What does that mean?"
