# Chapter 65: Dance

The knights were tense due to Aoi and Hisui acting differently from
usual. What's more, the dance was about to begin.  
They wanted to attract Aoi and Hisui's attention, but... Amidst all
this, someone broke the equilibrium: Arcadia.  
  
"M, Miss Hisui. Would you do me the honor of dancing with me?"  
"Yes, that would be fine."  
  
Hisui had learned to dance as part of her training when she was a knight
apprentice in the Mars territory. Count Mars believed that the movements
of dance were connected to swordsmanship, so all the knights of the Mars
territory learned to dance, and were good at it.  
Hisui was also quite good at dancing, but because she had learned it as
training in the knighthood, she had never danced as a form of romantic
pursuit between a man and a woman.  
When she was invited by Arcadia, she accepted with the same feeling as
facing off in a sword fight.  
  
However, the knights, unaware of this situation, were excited. Hisui had
been taken first, so they would invite Aoi after Arcadia. Everyone
thought so and rushed towards Aoi.  
"Miss Aoi, let's dance together."  
"No, I'm better than him!"  
  
Aoi watched the knights with a grin, but then said,  
  
"Everyone, I'm sorry. I already have a prior engagement for the
dance."  
  
These words from Aoi filled the knights with murderous intent.  
  
(Damn it, who snuck in ahead of us!)  
  
"Lady Aoi, how about a dance?"  
  
The one who appeared there was none other than Marquis Barlmin. The
knights all thought,  
  
(Marquis! Please give way to the younger generation!!)  
  
—  
  
"Arcadia, you're good at dancing."  
"No, I'm just desperately trying to keep my balance since I only have
one arm. Ah, but Miss Hisui, please don't mind me. I'm proud to have
been able to be of assistance to you."  
"Arcadia is strong."  
  
Hisui and Arcadia's dance was eye-catching. It was rough, but very
passionate.  
  
"Lady Aoi, youth is wonderful, isn't it?"  
  
Marquis Barlmin also smiled as he watched Hisui and Arcadia's dance,
finding it heartwarming.  
  
(Hmph, whatever. Hisui looks like she's having fun! Huh? Why do I feel
like this?)  
  
Aoi was bewildered by the sudden surge of jealousy.  
  
(No, no, Aoi. Calm down, calm down...)  
  
"Ho ho ho. So Lady Aoi makes such expressions too, huh."  
"No, Marquis! This is..."  
"I've also admired Lady Aoi for a long time, you know."  
  
Aoi nodded with a bashful expression and smiled at Marquis Barlmin.  
  
—  
  
After that, Aoi refused all invitations to dance. The knights' jealousy
towards Marquis Barlmin reached its peak.  
  
(I wanted to dance with Miss Aoi!!)  
  
And Hisui and Arcadia were starting their third dance. In the Asura
Kingdom, it was implicitly understood that a man and a woman dancing
three songs together was a sign that they accepted each other's
feelings. And everyone in the venue, including Aoi, sensed the
fulfillment of Hisui and Arcadia's love. Everyone except for one person,
Hisui.  
  
Arcadia was at the height of happiness.  
  
"Miss Hisui, I hope we can support each other. I look forward to working
with you from now on."  
"Yes. I'm going to research the Dragon Armament in the Great Forest from
now on. I think I can also help Arcadia's arm with it."  
"Yes, my arm will be fine anytime. Please stay with me forever, Miss
Hisui."  
  
Hisui didn't understand what Arcadia was saying, but,  
  
"Arcadia, I have something I have to accomplish with Aoi, and I can't be
with you..."  
  
With these words, Arcadia realized Hisui's feelings.  
  
(Ah, her feelings aren't directed towards me.)  
  
"Miss Hisui, the dance was fun. Please dance with me again sometime."  
"Yes, likewise."  
  
Hisui and Arcadia bowed to each other and parted amicably.  
  
"Aoi, would you like to dance with me?"  
  
Hisui, who had parted with Arcadia, came to Aoi's side and said.  
"Sure, but wouldn't that be bad for Arcadia?"  
"Why is that?"  
"Because you danced three songs, right?"  
"Arcadia was quite good at dancing. It reminded me of my training in the
Mars territory."  
"???"  
  
Aoi couldn't quite grasp the meaning of Hisui's words, but she took
Hisui's hand and began to dance. The two danced in perfect harmony, and
thanks to their high physical abilities, it was wonderful. However, Aoi
was in a bad mood during the dance.  
  
(I promised to pamper her...)  
  
Aoi felt a little sad when she looked at Hisui's face.
