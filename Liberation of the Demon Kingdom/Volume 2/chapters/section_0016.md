# Chapter 45: Run Through the Underground Passage

It was evening when they arrived at the watermill.  
The watermill was located a few hundred meters from the capital, near a
small stream that flowed into the capital through the walls surrounding
it.  
  
"It's quite a big hut. I'd like to wait for nightfall, but we should
hurry."  
  
About 10 soldiers with weapons were guarding the hut.  
  
"Mr. Asain, the mini-lems, I'm going to neutralize the soldiers around
the hut with small golems. Once we take control of the area, Aoi will
release a ball of light inside the hut, so be careful not to look at
it."  
"Understood. But Miss Hisui, you have golems?"  
  
Normally, earth users move golems assembled in advance. Asain had never
heard of a user who could "create" a golem on the spot.  
  
"Yes, here."  
  
Saying this, Hisui kneaded magicules into the ground, creating a
mini-lem.  
  
"Wow, amazing! I've never seen anything like it."  
"After securing the entrance to the underground passage, we’ll have the
mini-lems go ahead to ensure the safety of the route. After that, we’ll
confirm the number of soldiers at the exit. If there are about 20
soldiers, I’ll take the lead and break through. If there are more
soldiers, Aoi will go first."  
  
(If possible, I don't want Aoi using any magic. It's frustrating...)  
  
"After that, we’ll go to the Intelligence Division's base. If you get
separated, come here."  
  
The spot Aoi pointed to was a place Asain knew well.  
  
"The Whimsy. A diner, I see."  
  
It was a bar and diner that he often went to with his fellow knights. He
never imagined it was the Intelligence Division's hideout!  
  
"Yeah, tell them you've come to pick up something Amano left behind."  
"If we can't break through the enemy soldiers, we'll return to the
farmhouse where we changed clothes earlier. Okay, let's go."  
  
—  
  
Hisui led the way to the watermill. Approaching naturally as if by
chance.  
  
"Hey, you. Halt."  
  
A soldier called out, but Hisui paid no attention to it. She indicated
to the basket she was holding and said,  
  
"Hey fellas, don't you want some alcohol? I'll give you a good price."  
  
She said with a smile.  
  
"I might buy it if you give me a kiss."  
  
Three soldiers approached with lewd smiles. Just as their hands were
about to grab Hisui,  
  
"Mini-lem!"  
  
Hisui created three mini-lems from the ground and subdued the seven
soldiers around her in an instant.  
The soldier who approached Hisui didn't understand what was happening,
and his neck was cut by Hisui's dagger, killing him instantly. Hisui
then rushed the mini-lems to the entrance and smashed through the
door.  
  
"Aoi!"  
  
Immediately, Aoi created a ball of light and threw it into the hut. The
inside of the hut immediately became noisy. There were five soldiers in
the hut, but they were quickly subdued by Aoi and Hisui, who danced in,
and all of them were restrained by Hisui's earth magic.  
  
"Asain, this is the entrance."  
"Yes! Here is the magic sword I was holding for you."  
  
Aoi received Nijimaru and created a blade of light, smashing open the
door to the underground passage. A staircase to the underground passage
appeared there.  
  
"Mini-lems!"  
  
Hisui sent three mini-lems ahead into the underground passage. Soon
after,  
  
"The safety of the underground passage has been secured."  
  
Hisui said.  
  
"Okay, let's run."  
  
The three ran down the stairs and through the 500m underground passage.
Aoi created light using magic.
