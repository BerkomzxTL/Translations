# Chapter 50: Those Who Writhe

"Dista, can't you find Aoi?"  
"I've mobilized 200 soldiers, but even the traces of magicules have
disappeared. We still haven't found her."  
"Continue the search. It seems the royal capital's knights are also on
the move. Be wary of them as well."  
  
Although Buenos felt that Aoi was already unfindable, he ordered Dista
to continue the search.  
  
(It would be troublesome if they synchronized their movements with the
knights. I want to make the first move.)  
  
Buenos had suffered serious injuries in the battle with Aoi, but he had
recovered through healing from a light user.  
  
(But it will take another two days for my magicules to fully
recover...)  
  
Buenos had miscalculated the amount of power that Aoi possessed.  
  
(She shouldn't be able to use dark magic... And yet she's that
strong...)  
  
Buenos closed his eyes quietly.  
  
(I need to take some measures...)  
  
â€”  
  
Dista was 30 years old, a smooth-talking, timid man. At the age of 20,
he skillfully seduced the only daughter of the Marquis Barlmin family
and was brought into the family as an adopted son-in-law. After that,
the two sons, who were the real children of the Marquis Barlmin family,
were killed in action in the Battle of the Sugal Plains, and he was
regarded as a possible candidate to become the next lord.  
However, Marquis Barlmin did not value Dista. One day, Marquis Barlmin
summoned Dista to his residence and made it clear that he had no
intention of letting him succeed the Marquis family. From there, Dista's
strange behavior began.  
With the backing of the Order of Chaos, with whom he had been acquainted
for some time, he began hunting demi-humans, especially children, in the
territory. This was because the Order of Chaos was buying up many
children behind the scenes. Dista knew well what purpose the Order
needed the children for.  
Every time he kidnapped a child, Dista gained a lot of money and power.
This act was done to line Dista's own pockets, but because many soldiers
had lost their lives in the previous Battle of Sugal Plains in the
Barlmin territory, and because there was a lot of damage from monsters
as it bordered the Great Forest, some of the people cultishly supported
Dista, who hunted demi-humans. However, this act was discovered by
Marquis Barlmin, and he was enraged. Dista was dismissed and placed
under house arrest. That's when Buenos appeared.  
  
"I'll make you the lord."  
  
Buenos gathered soldiers and knights who supported the demi-human
hunting and staged a coup. Dista was released, and Marquis Barlmin was
instead imprisoned by Dista.  
However, Dista was timid. He was afraid that the matter would be
revealed to the royal capital and could not bring himself to kill
Marquis Barlmin.  
  
"Everyone keeps getting in my way!"  
  
Just as Dista kicked the desk in his office, there was a knock on the
door.  
  
"What is it?"  
  
It was Jules who entered the office. From Dista's point of view, he was
a good-for-nothing who couldn't even get rid of two young girls.  
  
"I received a report that a group believed to be knights has entered the
capital, so I came to inform you..."  
  
Jules was unable to finish his sentence. The cup that Dista threw hit
Jules' forehead, and blood dripped.  
  
"Hmph, a good-for-nothing who can't even get rid of young girls! What
face do you have to come here! Get lost!"  
  
Jules bowed and left the office. Although Jules was disappointed with
Dista's attitude, he felt that he had to make up for it or he would have
no future advancement.  
  
(I won't forget the humiliation from that time! Those little girls!! I
will definitely find them and kill them in a humiliating way!)  
  
This was a lonely determination with no one to share it with.
