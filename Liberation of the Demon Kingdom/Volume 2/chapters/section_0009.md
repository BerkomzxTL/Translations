# Chapter 38: Monster Extermination

Aoi and Hisui were riding on a Gamou bird together.  
  
"Gam, how about trying to reduce the release of magicules a little more?
Instead of spreading magicules throughout, imagine spinning a string
with a weight on the end."  
"Understood! I'll try it!"  
  
Gam straddled another Gamou bird. Gam was using wind magic for
reconnaissance under Aoi's guidance. Wind magic is suitable for spatial
awareness and is very useful for grasping terrain and searching for the
enemy.  
  
"Kamo, could you go a little slower?"  
  
The Gamou bird (female) that Aoi and Hisui were riding was named Kamo,
and the Gamou bird (male) that Gam was riding was named Gamo. By the
way, according to Hisui, the one who named them,  
  
"Just because."  
  
Thatâ€™s what she said.  
  
There had been no more attacks since then, and Aoi and the others were
progressing smoothly on their journey, but the number of monsters
increased as they entered the forest area leading to the territory
capital. Normally, ensuring the safety of the territory's highways is
the job of the Knights Order held by the lord.  
  
"The Knights Order must not be functioning."  
  
"Marquis Barlmin is a very kind old man, though. I wonder what's
happened to him?"  
  
Aoi looked worried.  
  
"Miss Aoi! A horde of monsters is approaching."  
  
Gam raised his voice with tension.  
  
"Ah, Gam. Good job! I know."  
"Gam is getting used to controlling magicules too."  
  
Hisui praised Gam, which was rare for her.  
  
"That's right. It would be nice if he could reduce the amount of
magicules a little more so he wouldn't get tired. Now then, Hisui. Shall
we kill them?"  
"Aoi, you're being violent."  
"Yes, thanks to someone's influence."  
  
Aoi began to infuse magicules into her right hand and tried to release a
light arrow.  
  
"Aoi, please don't use too many magicules. Leave it to me."  
  
Hisui calmly said that, infused magicules into a stone, and threw it
towards the approaching Wao Wolves. The stone crushed the Wao Wolves one
after another.  
  
"Ah, Hisui. Leave one! Gam, I'll leave the last Wao Wolf to you."  
"Yes, Miss Aoi."  
  
Gam fired an air blade at the Wao Wolf's neck, severing the carotid
artery. The Wao Wolf collapsed, spilling blood.  
  
"Oh, there's also a group of people. Did this pack of Wao Wolves flee
from that group over there? I feel something unpleasant coming from
them. Gam, can you pick up the sounds with wind magic?"  
  
(That was Marsim's specialty.)  
  
Hisui thought that while overlapping Gam with Marsim.  
  
"Yes, I think I can. Please wait a moment."
