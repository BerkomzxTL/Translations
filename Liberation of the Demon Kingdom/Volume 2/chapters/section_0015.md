# Chapter 44: Infiltration of the Territory Capital

They decided to leave Kamo and Gamo at the stable of the hideout. From
here to the capital city, they would walk.  
  
"Gamou birds are quite conspicuous. The caretaker will stop by here in
the morning and evening, so there's no need to worry about looking after
them."  
  
Aoi and the other two headed for the capital city along a small path in
the forest instead of the main road. All weapons besides the daggers
were hidden in the basket that Asain carried on his back.  
  
"This is just a small path, but it's used by forest rangers, guards,
hunters, and farmers, so it's best if the weapons aren't discovered."  
  
They passed a few farmers, but they didn't seem suspicious.  
  
"We'll continue as is to the watermill with the underground passage.
From there, we'll enter the capital city via the underground passage
without passing through the city gate."  
"Mr. Asain, are there many underground passages like this?"  
"As far as I know, there are five. Since I know about them, I think it's
safe to assume that there are guards posted."  
  
There were multiple secret passages leading out of the capital that
didn’t involve going through the gate. Most of them were hidden passages
for those of high rank to escape in case of an attack. The Knights
managed the five routes in case of an emergency.  
  
"I see. Can you tell me how long the underground passage is, and how the
entrance and exit are constructed?"  
  
Because the passage was made for emergency use, it was minimal, and
anyone wanting to set up an ambush would only need to control the
entrance and exit.  
  
"We should assume there are lookouts. Moreover, we repelled the people
who came after Asain and the others. If word gets out that we fought
them off, security will be tightened. Let's get into the capital and
contact the Intelligence Division before Dista finds out. Strike while
the iron is hot! Let's go!"  
  
Hisui was wondering if Aoi would say "break through by force" and asked
just in case.  
  
"Aoi, do you have a plan?"  
"From what I’ve heard, the underground passage is a single path, with
one entrance and one exit. Isn't the only option to break through by
force?"  
"Yes…I thought you'd say that, Aoi."  
"But isn't that the only way?"  
  
Aoi said, peering at Hisui. Certainly, in this situation, breaking
through might be the only option.  
  
"I'll create mini-lems, so I'll have them deal with the enemy soldiers
as much as possible. If we encounter the swordsman who fought near the
Barlmin territory's checkpoint, it will be troublesome, so let's
conserve our strength as much as possible. Stay quiet until we're
discovered."  
"Okay, I'll do my best."  
"Well then, let's hurry."  
"Mr. Asain, please lead the way."
