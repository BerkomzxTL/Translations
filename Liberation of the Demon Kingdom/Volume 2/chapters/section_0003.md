# Chapter 32: The Battle Begins!

Hisui quietly moved to the window of the next room. Picking up a
fist-sized stone, she imbued it with magicules,  
  
"Sorry for breaking the glass."  
  
She threw it into the room. The stone immediately turned into a mini-lem
and beat down the men hiding there.  
  
"Small mini-lems are good at moving in tight spaces, aren't they?"  
  
Indeed, the men couldn't draw their swords in the narrow room and were
being beaten down because they couldn't keep up with the mini-lem's
quick movements.  
  
"It's getting noisy downstairs. Alright, let's go!"  
  
Aoi threw the window wide open and jumped out. Hisui followed behind
her.  
  
—  
  
The soldiers were caught off guard. This was because their targets were
two young and beautiful girls. Although a C-Rank knight from Barlmin was
in command, the soldiers' morale was low. To begin with, the charges
were unclear, and they didn't know who the girls were. Despite this, so
many soldiers had been mobilized. The soldiers were thinking,  
  
"Are the higher-ups idiots?"  
  
That’s what they thought.  
But... there was a sudden commotion coming from the room next to the one
they were watching. Four men were on guard duty there. Then, the window
suddenly opened and two girls jumped out.  
  
"..."  
  
It was a breathtaking display of agility. The short-haired girl jumped
down into the middle of the soldiers gathered around the inn and
instantly mowed down three of them with a blade of light. The other girl
wrapped her sword in iron and swung it like a whip. The flexible, freely
extending whip made of iron swept the legs out from under four
soldiers.  
  
"Hisui, let's run!"  
  
The girls created a breakthrough in an instant and ran off.  
  
"Mini-lem!"  
  
A small golem followed behind the long-haired girl, waddling along. One
of the soldiers who tried to chase them was kicked in the leg by the
mini-lem and crouched down. The soldiers blankly watched the girls run
away, but…  
  
"What are you doing! After them!!"  
  
The knight's command snapped them back to reality. The soldiers
frantically chased after the girls, towards the market square.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui, that's amazing. What's with that whip-like thing?"  
"It's an application of the technique to change the shape of a material
permeated with magicules. I'm changing and hitting the iron with infused
magicules."  
"Water users do that a lot, right? Iron instead of water... Hisui,
you're the strongest."  
"No, no, I'm still not on Aoi's level."  
"The mini-lem is moving well too. So cute."  
  
Aoi said, looking at the mini-lem following behind Hisui with a
clattering sound.  
When the two arrived at the market square, they stopped and once again
drew their swords.  
  
"They're so slow."  
"I wonder if they're not chasing us?"  
  
In reality, the soldiers were chasing the two, but they had lost sight
of them due to their speed.  
Aoi got tired of waiting and put her sword back in its sheath, then sat
down on the spot. After a while, a group of soldiers finally found the
two.  
  
"There they are!"  
(That's a cliché line.)  
  
Hisui was vaguely thinking about such things.  
Aoi waited for the soldiers to gather before,  
  
"Here we go."  
  
She stood up and slowly released magicules into the sky. The light
turned into countless arrows and rained down on the soldiers. Most of
the soldiers were paralyzed by this attack and could not move. The
soldiers who were outside the range of the attack lost their will to
fight and collapsed on the spot.  
  
"Are you the commander?"  
  
Hisui asked the knight in a cold voice.  
  
"What is this? Who are you people?"  
"Why are you targeting us?"  
"H-How dare those involved in human trafficking say that!"  
"Oh, we're human traffickers? Where did that information come from?
Answer me!"  
"To disguise yourselves as merchants and kidnap children, how
villainous!"  
  
The knight became enraged, drew his sword, and launched a wind blade.
Aoi dodged the wind blade by leaning back and ran straight at the
knight, slamming a palm strike into his chin. The knight lost
consciousness and collapsed.  
"Hisui, capture him. I'm worried about Mr. Onjin and the others."  
  
Hisui restrained the knight with earth magic.  
  
"Hisui, let's go!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui hurriedly ran back to the inn where they had separated
from Onjin.
