# Chapter 49: Covered in Wounds

Hisui was confused.  
  
(Since he called himself the Dragon Knight, he must be the Dragon Knight
Aldey, one of the Six Heroes. Why? Aoi?)  
  
"Aoi is my comrade. I came to convey a request from my comrade. Hisui,
come with me."  
"Is Aoi okay?"  
"Not okay, but alive. Is there anyone who can use healing? If so, I want
them to come with us."  
"I heard that Lord Aldey is a user of light. Couldn't Lord Aldey use
healing on Aoi?"  
"My light magic was sealed away along with my right hand. So I can't use
healing."  
  
(Ah, Aoi said that he was cut by Magicules Eater and lost his right arm
and light magic.)  
  
Unfortunately, there was no one here who could use healing.  
  
"Anyway, Hisui. I'll lead the way, so let's hurry."  
  
â€”  
  
"Lord Aldey. Please forgive my various impoliteness."  
"No, it's fine. I like your feelings for Aoi."  
  
Hisui silently bowed to Aldey's back as he led the way. It was just
dawn. Many soldiers were on alert in the capital. Aldey proceeded,
weaving through the gaps.  
  
"Lord Aldey, thank you very much. If you hadn't led the way, we would
have had to fight our way through."  
"Since I became like this, I've become skilled at avoiding battles. It's
here."  
  
Aldey led Hisui to a house on the outskirts of the capital. Aldey opened
the gate and entered the house.  
The inside of the house had high ceilings and seemed to have many
rooms.  
  
"Here."  
  
Aldey opened the door of a room and invited Hisui inside.  
  
"Aoi..."  
  
There, Aoi was lying down, still in blood-stained clothes.  
  
"Aoi!"  
Hisui rushed over and took Aoi's hand.  
  
"Aoi! Are you okay?"  
  
Aoi opened her eyes slightly and looked at Hisui.  
  
"Ah, Hisui. Sorry, I made you worry."  
  
Hisui gently hugged Aoi.  
  
"It's enough if Aoi is safe..."  
"Aoi, I brought Hisui. She's quite a strong girl."  
"Yeah."  
  
Aoi nodded and closed her eyes.  
  
"Aoi?"  
"She seems to be asleep. She must have been relieved that you came."  
  
Hisui gasped when she saw Aoi's body. She had wounds all over, and the
burn on her right leg was especially severe.  
  
"The knights will be arriving this afternoon. I think there will be a
light user as well. I'll be with her until then. Lord Aldey, when the
knights arrive at The Whimsy, could you please bring them here?"  
"I don't mind. Then I'll wait at The Whimsy. You can do whatever you
want with this house. There are changes of clothes here too."  
"Thank you very much, Lord Aldey."  
  
After Aldey left for The Whimsy, Hisui took off Aoi's clothes and wiped
the dirt from her body.  
  
"I can't believe Aoi would end up like this..."  
  
Hisui put the change of clothes she borrowed from Aldey on Aoi. Aoi
remained asleep with her eyes closed. Hisui rested her cheek against
Aoi's and muttered.  
  
"Aoi, hang in there."  
  
After that, Hisui held Aoi's hand the whole time.
