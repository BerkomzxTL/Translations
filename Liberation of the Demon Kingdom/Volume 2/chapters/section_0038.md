# Chapter 67: Departure

**Last chapter of volume 2, The Barlmin Territory**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
In the morning, Hisui woke up to the sunlight streaming through the
window.  
  
(Huh? When did I fall asleep?)  
  
Looking next to her, Aoi was sleeping in her underwear.  
  
"Aoi, please wake up."  
  
Hisui gave Aoi a light kiss on the cheek.  
  
"What is it?"  
"Aoi, good morning. Today is the day we depart for the Great Forest."  
  
Hisui got up from the sheets she was wrapped in.  
  
"Ah!"  
  
Hisui was naked. Hisui blushed as she remembered what happened
yesterday.  
Aoi looked at Hisui with a grin.  
  
"Hisui was so cute yesterday. You fainted just from me biting your
breast a little."  
"That's not fair! Aoi! That's not fair..."  
"To tell you the truth, Hisui, you saw the dark and light particles,
right? When I get in that kind of mood, it seems like I unconsciously
activate that magic. And, as a side effect, it seems to make the other
person's senses many times more sensitive..."  
  
Hisui glared at Aoi lightly and said in a small, almost inaudible
voice.  
  
"Next time, I want to be mean to Aoi..."  
"I understand, Hisui. When we arrive safely at the Great Forest,
okay?"  
  
Aoi felt a sense of danger, but she thought Hisui was cute like that.  
  
"Alright, let's get ready! Let's go!"  
  
—  
  
"Mr. Onjin, thank you for everything."  
"Thank you for taking care of Gam and Jim."  
  
Gam was able to join the Barlmin territory Knights as an apprentice
through Asain's introduction. Being trained as a user, it’ll be good for
Gam's future.  
However, Gam didn't intend to become a knight, but seemed to want to
become a mercenary.  
Jim was going to the Great Forest with Aoi and the others. He was also
enthusiastic, as it would be a good opportunity to learn Jinrai's
techniques.  
And one more person. Aldey was to accompany them to the Great Forest.  
  
"You're going to make it so I can use the Dragon Armament, right? What's
going to happen if I don't go?"  
  
That was one purpose.  
  
Another thing is that it had been revealed that the Order of Chaos was
kidnapping demi-human children in the Barlmin territory and using them
as materials for cursed swords and as test subjects.  
The Marquis wanted to take countermeasures in cooperation with the
"Emerald Spirit Queen Anna" of the Great Forest. Aldey, one of the Six
Heroes, was the perfect person to serve as a messenger.  
  
"Marquis! I'll come again! Let's dance again!"  
"Lady Aoi, be careful. Everyone, please take care of her."  
  
Arcadia had come to see Hisui off.  
  
"Arcadia, once I’ve mastered the Dragon Armament, I’ll make an arm for
you, so please wait for me."  
  
Arcadia wanted to spend his life with Hisui. However, Arcadia himself
knew very well that Hisui's feelings were not directed towards him.  
  
"Yes, please do. I will also work hard in the Barlmin territory so that
I don't lose to Miss Hisui!"  
  
Hisui and Arcadia had a plain farewell.  
Aoi and Hisui rode on Kamo, while Jim was riding on Gamo.  
  
"Aldey, what is that creature??"  
  
Aldey was riding a horse-like creature with scales.  
  
"It's a horse lizard. What, Aoi doesn't know about them?"  
"No, no one knows about them, right?"  
  
Hisui and Jim nodded strongly at Aoi's words.  
  
"Does it bite?"  
  
Hisui cautiously stroked the horse lizard's nose.  
  
"Well, it rarely bites."  
  
Indeed, Jim, who tried to stroke the nose after Hisui, was bitten and
had to be healed by Aoi.  
  
"What's its name?"  
"Artesia."  
"H-Heh. Quite a noble name."
