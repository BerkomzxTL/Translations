# Chapter 57: Trap

Asain’s team had secured the back entrance. However, they felt it odd
that soldiers were stationed outside the mansion while there were hardly
any soldiers inside.  
  
"Is something going on? Mr. Elliot! Do you know anything?"  
"Melmo, can you scout inside the mansion?"  
  
Elliot asked the beastkin woman who worked as a waitress at The Whimsy.
Melmo skillfully used wind magic.  
  
"Please wait a moment. There are children in the mansion. The flow of
magicules is strange! Master, this place is dangerous!"  
  
Asain made a quick decision.  
  
"I trust Miss Aoi and the others! We will defend this entrance to the
death! Don't let any enemy soldiers get close. They'll come from outside
the mansion."  
Asain gazed in the direction of the study.  
  
"Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. Please be safe."  
  
—  
  
Aoi and Hisui smashed through the window of a room on the side of the
mansion and rushed to the study. There was no sign of soldiers
lurking.  
  
"Hisui, I have a bad feeling about this."  
"Yes, something's up."  
  
Aoi was suspicious of how easily they had reached the study. But, after
taking a breath, she broke down the door to the study. Inside, the
Marquis was gagged and bound, unable to move.  
A magic circle was drawn around the Marquis. And as soon as the study
door was broken down, the inscribed magic was activated. Magicules were
poured into the Marquis from the magic stones placed around him.  
  
"Hisui, it's a demonization engraving magic! I'll move the Marquis out
of the circle!"  
Aoi rushed to the Marquis, resisted the flow of magicules from the magic
stones, removed the Marquis' bonds and gag, and tried to carry him out
of the circle.  
  
"Marquis?"  
"GAAAAH!"  
  
With a sharp roar, the Marquis' body grew larger.  
  
(The Marquis was already being demonized!)  
  
And then the Marquis powerfully pinned down Aoi in a bear hug. At the
same time, "another engraving magic" was activated.  
The space where the Marquis was imprisoned warped, and a space-time hole
appeared. The Marquis tried to fall into that hole with Aoi.  
  
"Aoi!"  
  
The magicules of the children placed in the mansion rushed through the
magic circle, raging through the space-time hole like a storm. Hisui was
barely able to resist the storm of magicules by deploying dark
magicules.  
  
"Aoi!"  
  
Hisui's scream echoed through the office.  
  
—  
  
Arcadia was in pain as he was exposed to the magicule storm. This was
because the children's magicules were being sucked into the magic
circle, flowing into the center, probably the study, as a huge force,
like a typhoon.  
The reason Arcadia was able to endure was because the children were
imprisoned around the perimeter of the magic circle, so the flow of
magicules was relatively gentle.  
  
(If I destroy those magic stones, can I change the flow of magicules?
No, if the flow of magicules changes, the children will be in danger.)  
  
"B, big brother! Help me!"  
  
Arcadia entered the cage he had slashed open and threw the children out
of the cage one by one. But as soon as Arcadia entered the cage, his
magicules were rapidly stolen.  
  
(O, one more left.)  
  
Arcadia threw the last person out of the cage, then stabbed and
destroyed the magic stone embedded in the cage with his sword. As a
result of the magic stone being destroyed, the flowing magicules
stagnated inside, corroding Arcadia's body.  
  
"Gu..."  
  
But the magicule storm quickly came to a halt.  
Arcadia somehow managed to maintain his fading consciousness and guided
the children out of the mansion through the front entrance.  
  
"You're going to die here."  
  
Waiting there was the knight order led by Dista and Orb.
