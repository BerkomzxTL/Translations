# Chapter 36: Cleaning Up

The knight's name was Jules. A C-Rank knight of the Barlmin territory.  
  
"My name is Hisui, an A-Rank knight of the Asura Kingdom's Intelligence
Division. I am acting under a secret order from King Berg. An attack on
us could be considered an act of rebellion against the Asura Kingdom,
you know."  
"I only acted on orders! Besides, your identity is suspicious! And what
about the other woman? Is she really a D-Rank knight? She's probably
some kind of monster!"  
  
Hisui sighed and looked back at Aoi.  
  
"D-Rank is still too much."  
"That's not true. I think D-Rank suits such a lovely girl just fine."  
  
Hisui sighed again and said,  
  
"That's right. She's a monster. If you don't say anything, you'll be
eaten."  
"Hey, Hisui..."  
"Hmph, I won't say anything, and I have nothing to say!"  
  
The soldiers were mostly mercenaries gathered from the village and knew
nothing. On the contrary, they were dissatisfied with not being informed
of the details of the attack.  
  
"It can't be helped. It'll take too long, so let's just release him.
We'll have to hear the circumstances from Marquis Barlmin. I'll take his
pass for now."  
"Yes, that would be good."  
  
Hisui said that, took the pass from Jules, and released him from his
restraints.  
  
"Damn it! Remember this!"  
  
Jules uttered something clichéd and ran off.  
  
"Mr. Onjin, we're being portrayed as heinous criminals who kidnap
children. I'm really sorry. We're the ones being targeted. So I was
thinking it might be better to split up..."  
"No, Miss Aoi. I saw your strength with my own eyes. I think I'm safer
with you. So, if possible, I'd like you to accompany us to the capital.
Everyone will be sad if we part ways here."  
"Okay, I understand. I'll do my best to protect this merchant
caravan."  
"And... about Jim, I'd like you to take him to the Great Forest. Um…is
it to repair Lord Jinrai's magic equipment? I'd like Jim to help with
that. I beg you."  
  
With that, Onjin bowed deeply.  
  
"We'd like that too, but is it okay?"  
"Yes, I talked to Jim, and Gam asked me to as well."  
"Thank you, Mr. Onjin. We'll take responsibility for Jim."  
  
That day, the two ended up staying at the same inn as Onjin and the
others. The inn had a large room, so a drinking party started involving
the other guests. How brilliant Aoi's swordsmanship was! How graceful
Hisui's magic was! The topics never ran out, and Aoi and Hisui felt
embarrassed. In the end, the two's heroic tales were told until late
that night.
