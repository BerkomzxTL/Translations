# Chapter 34: Warrior of the Sugal Plains

"Are you all right, Mr. Onjin?"  
"Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui are both strong, aren't you? Well, I figured
you were strong, but not to this extent."  
  
Then Onjin whispered in Aoi's ear.  
  
"Miss Aoi, you lied about being D-Rank, didn't you?"  
  
Aoi gave an ambiguous smile, left Onjin's side, and sat next to Hisui.  
  
"That was a dark magic sword, wasn't it?"  
"Yeah."  
"You’re the warrior who dispelled the curse on the Sugal Plains three
years ago, right Aoi?"  
"Yeah."  
"I see..."  
"Hisui, you resent me, don't you?"  
"Resent?"  
"I was the one who transferred the dark magicules to Hisui on the Sugal
Plains. I was the one who destined Hisui to liberate the Demon
Continent. Hisui should have had the option to live in peace, but I took
that away. There's no way you wouldn't resent me!"  
"Aoi, don't ever say that again."  
  
Tears streamed from Hisui's eyes.  
  
"The scene I witnessed on the Sugal Plains was beautiful. Every time the
particles danced, the curse was erased. That warrior is someone I admire
greatly. From that time on, I wanted to become strong. Aoi changed my
life of just living as a little girl!!"  
Hisui said as if shouting, then buried her head in her knees.  
  
"I received so much from Aoi. I'm grateful."  
  
Aoi put her hand on Hisui's head and said,  
  
"Thank you, Hisui."  
  
She said as if murmuring.  
  
"Pigeon."  
  
A coo was heard from above, and a carrier pigeon landed.  
Aoi removed the letter tied around its neck and opened it.  
  
"The attack in the royal capital was carried out by knights from the
Barlmin territory. There’s the shadow of the Order of Chaos. Be careful.
Contact the Intelligence Division in the capital."  
  
Aoi looked up at the sky.  
  
"Miss Amano, you're a little late!"
