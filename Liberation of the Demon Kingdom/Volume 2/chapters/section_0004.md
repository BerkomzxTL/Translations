# Chapter 33: The Power of Darkness

"Mr. Onjin!"  
"Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. Are you safe!?"  
  
They ran into Onjin's merchant caravan on the way to the inn.  
  
"Gam sensed the soldiers heading our way, so we ran. But they're chasing
us."  
"Good job, Gam!"  
  
Aoi happily called out to Gam.  
  
"No, I would have been in trouble if Miss Aoi hadn't taught me magicule
control."  
"Leave the rest to us."  
"Aoi, there are about 10 people. One has a cursed sword!"  
"He's suppressing his magicules. He's strong."  
"Aoi, please be careful."  
  
(I wonder if Mr. Onjin and the others were allowed to escape on purpose.
He probably thought it would be disadvantageous for us to fight while
protecting Mr. Onjin and the others!)  
  
Hisui drew her Yagiri, wrapped it in iron, and swung it like a whip.
Soldiers fell one after another, and soon all the soldiers were
crouching on the spot.  
  
(Okay! One more left.)  
  
Aoi was confronting the remaining swordsman, who was wearing black armor
and wielding a cursed sword.  
  
"Who are you?"  
"Are you Aoi?"  
"Oh, so you know me."  
"Child of Darkness. You are an obstacle."  
  
The blow unleashed from the swordsman's cursed sword was sharp. The dark
magicules released from the sword strike were deflected by Aoi's
resistance, but shattered the wall behind her.  
  
"As far as I know, there are three dark magic swords. Magicule Eater,
Corruption Poison, and Darkness Cutter. Your sword is Corruption Poison,
right? An original."  
"That's right. Your magic sword is wasted on you. I'll take it."  
  
The swordsman swung down at Aoi from above. Aoi drew Nijimaru and
blocked the swordsman's sword, but the blow was heavy. Aoi deflected the
heavy slash with Nijimaru, gathered magicules in her right hand, formed
a ball of light, slipped through the swordsman's flurry of attacks, and
slammed it into his stomach. But,  
  
"You're wearing good armor. But it makes me want to puke... it’s
cursed."  
  
Although the magicules that Aoi slammed into the swordsman did damage,
much of it was negated by the armor.  
  
"As expected, you use magicules well."  
  
The swordsman, who had dropped to one knee from the impact, staggered to
his feet and began to infuse his cursed sword with magicules.  
  
"Hisui, that's bad. Get everyone far away!"  
"Aoi!"  
"Hurry."  
  
Aoi sheathed Nijimaru, took an iai stance, and infused it with
magicules.  
  
"Everyone, hurry. Get away from here."  
  
Hisui shouted and guided everyone away as Onjin and the others rushed
off in a panic.  
When the swordsman had gathered enough magicules in his cursed sword, he
swung it down in one go. An eerie presence emanated from the cursed
sword, and a dark aura attacked Aoi.  
  
"Here I go!"  
  
Aoi also put all her energy into it and swung Nijimaru out of its
sheath. A torrent of light became multiple blades and collided with the
cursed aura. The clash of magicules scattered around, shattering the
buildings.  
  
"Aoi!"  
  
Hisui kneaded magicules and mixed them into the fragments of the
shattered buildings to create golems and attack the swordsman. But the
golems didn’t reach the swordsman and were blown apart by the cursed
aura.  
  
"!!"  
  
Aoi saw an opening in the swordsman. She infused her other sword with
magicules, drew it from its sheath, and slammed the magicule blade into
him. It was a much weaker force than the torrent of light, but it
reached the swordsman's body and injured his wrist.  
  
"To think it would come to this! Enough! I am Vegas! Aoi, next time I
will take your life!"  
  
The swordsman turned around and fled into the night.  
  
"That was the power of darkness..."  
  
Hisui muttered as she watched Aoi unleash her attack.
