# Chapter 47: Conflict

Hisui and Asain broke through the soldiers' encirclement and ran through
the alleys of the capital.  
  
"Miss Hisui, this way."  
  
Asain knew the capital inside and out, and took precautions to avoid
being followed as he made his way towards The Whimsy.  
  
"Mr. Asain, it seems we aren't being followed. Let's go to The Whimsy by
the shortest route."  
  
Hisui wanted to get in touch with the Intelligence Division as soon as
possible. She wanted to deliver Asain and return to Aoi. Hisui strongly,
strongly desired this.  
  
"Understood. This way."  
  
Asain accompanied Hisui, exiting the back alley. Soon after, Hisui
spotted a familiar signboard. The same design as the shop where she had
drunk with Aoi several times in the royal capital. Hisui impatiently
opened the door.  
  
"Welcome!"  
  
A cat-type beastkin waitress greeted them cheerfully.  
  
"I've come to pick up something that Miss Amano left behind."  
  
Hisui told the waitress her purpose. For a moment, the waitress twitched
her nose, but immediately,  
  
"I've already been informed! This way, please!"  
  
Hisui and Asain were led to a private room in the back. Soon after, a
man of about 30 years old came.  
  
"I'm Elliot, a B-Rank knight in the Intelligence Division."  
"I'm Hisui, an A-Rank knight. This is Mr. Asain, a B-Rank knight from
the Barlmin territory."  
"Nice to meet you. I've heard the outline from Dr. Amano. By the way,
where is Miss Aoi?"  
  
Hisui explained the circumstances of infiltrating the Barlmin territory
capital. And then,  
  
"I'm going to gather my equipment and join up with Aoi as soon as
possible."  
"Please wait, Miss Hisui. Do you know Miss Aoi's location?"  
"I think I can find her by tracing her magicules."  
"But there's a possibility that Miss Aoi is concealing her magicules and
lying low. More than anything, moving now would greatly increase the
risk of Miss Hisui being discovered by enemy soldiers. I understand your
concern, but I think it would be better to wait for Miss Aoi to arrive
here."  
  
Hisui had no answer to Elliot's sound argument.  
  
"Besides, 15 knights are scheduled to arrive from the royal capital by
noon tomorrow. Even if something unexpected happens, we should be able
to respond then."  
"Understood. I'll wait here."  
"Then I'll have some food and drinks brought over, so please wait."  
  
Hisui sat down on a chair in the private room and glared at the light
meal and drink placed on the table.  
  
"Miss Hisui, let's eat a little. You won't have the strength to last you
when you need it."  
"Yes."  
  
Hisui nodded weakly and reached for a sandwich.  
  
"Mr. Asain, all I can do is wait."  
"Waiting is also important. But let's be prepared to leave at any
time."  
  
Asain spoke gently to Hisui, who was about the age of his younger
sister.  
  
"You're right. I'm going to change, so could you please turn around?"  
  
After saying that, Hisui took off the clothes she had changed into at
the farmhouse and put on her usual easy-to-move clothes. And then, she
put on her magic armor and a jacket over it.  
  
(Aoi, please be safeâ€¦.)
