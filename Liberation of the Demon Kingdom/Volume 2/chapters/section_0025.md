# Chapter 54: Buenos' Secret Operations

Dista was in a bad mood. It was because Buenos had taken Marquis Barlmin
away without permission. But Dista didn't have the courage to protest to
Buenos. Above all, the magic swords used by the knights Dista relied on
were created by Buenos.  
  
(If I didn't have those magic swords, my knights wouldn't be able to
beat the royal capital's Knight Order.)  
  
Dista didn't want to upset Buenos.  
  
(Even so... to think that those magic swords were made by engraving the
magicules of the children we kidnapped. What kind of face would the
Marquis make if he knew that my strongest knights were using children as
material for equipment?)  
  
Buenos was creating copies of the magic sword by engraving the magicules
of the kidnapped children with the power of the cursed sword. Recently,
he had been applying a similar engraving to demi-humans and monsters,
creating monstrous creatures.  
  
(If I use that fighting force, I might be able to take over the kingdom.
But I don't like Buenos.)  
  
Dista hated the way Buenos looked at him as if he was something
worthless.  
  
"Everyone makes a fool of me!"  
  
At that moment, Orb, the leader of the Barlmin territory knight order,
appeared to report.  
  
"Lord Dista, I have found out where Buenos took Marquis Barlmin. It's
the Marquis' mansion. What's more, Buenos is deliberately leaking that
location."  
"What is he thinking?!"  
"Also... Lord Dista, I’m sorry to say this... but Buenos wants you to
come immediately..."  
"Damn it! Who does he think I am!"  
  
—  
  
When Dista went to Buenos' office, an Order of Chaos user wearing a hood
was charging magicules into a magic stone used for engraving magic.  
  
(They're creepy no matter how many times I see them...)  
  
Dista glanced at the Order of Chaos user and immediately turned his gaze
to Buenos.  
  
"Lord Buenos, did you call for me?"  
"We will use Marquis Barlmin as bait to lure Aoi out. I want you all to
place the kidnapped children along this wall. After that, I want the
knights to guard the mansion. That's right. If you value your life, you
shouldn't enter the mansion."  
  
Buenos handed Dista a piece of parchment.  
  
(...What does he mean by guard…? In the end, the children are all going
to be sacrificed for engraving magic, right?)  
"Well? Can you do it?"  
"Understood. I’ll mobilize the knights and arrange and guard them as you
command."  
"Then you should use this."  
  
Buenos handed Dista a bracelet.  
  
"It's a bracelet that seals magicules. Anyone who wears it will be
unable to use magic. However, it can’t be used on those with enormous
amounts of magicules. Don't misuse it."  
"Oh. So even users can be used as hostages."  
"That's right. Then, I'm counting on you."  
  
Dista bowed and left the office.  
  
(They're really creepy.)  
  
"Orb! We're going to Marquis Barlmin’s mansion. Bring the kidnapped
children too!"
