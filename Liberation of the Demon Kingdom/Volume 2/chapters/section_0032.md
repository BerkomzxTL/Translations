# Chapter 61: Gift

That evening, Aoi and Hisui were drinking at The Whimsy. Unlike the
royal capital, there were many dishes using wild vegetables and river
fish, and Aoi was drinking more alcohol than usual.  
  
"Aoi, are you okay?"  
"I'm fine, I'm fine. If it gets bad, I'll heal! More than that, to not
drink with such delicious food... it's rude to the food."  
  
The rumor that Aoi and Hisui were drinking at The Whimsy spread through
the territory capital in an instant. Knights from the Barlmin territory
and members of Onjin's caravan immediately appeared, surrounding Aoi and
Hisui and began drinking.  
Arcadia was one of those who heard such rumors, but his overly serious
personality was his undoing. He first went to invite Aldey. This is
because he was concerned that Aldey was old friends with Aoi and had
lamented that they rarely had time to meet.  
Therefore, when he arrived at The Whimsy with Aldey, it was a tragic
scene of drunken people lying dead everywhere.  
In the center of it all, Aoi was vigorously stroking Gam's head.  
  
"M, Miss Aoi. Around there... Miss Hisui is glaring this way..."  
"H, hello."  
  
Arcadia nervously called out to Aoi and Hisui.  
  
"Ah, Arcadia! Come here, come here."  
  
When Aoi beckoned him, Arcadia looked like he had seen something
terrifying and looked to Aldey for help.  
  
"Lord Aldey, Miss Aoi is calling you."  
"I'm calling Arcadia! Hisui, that! Give that to Arcadia."  
  
Hisui ran up to Arcadia and gently touched his right arm, thanking him
with tearfully.  
  
"Arcadia, thank you so much. Aoi is here now thanks to Arcadia. If Aoi
had disappeared, I don't think I would be here now either. I can't thank
you enough. About your arm... I don't know what to say..."  
  
As Hisui said this, she took out a silver bracelet from her jacket
pocket.  
  
"This is what you two gave me in the royal capital..."  
"Yes, I recovered it from the Marquis' residence. I imbued it with
magicules and processed it so that it can be easily put on with one
hand. I can't guarantee the effectiveness, but I designed the cherry
blossom crest of the Six Heroes to attract good luck. May Arcadia have
good luck..."  
  
Arcadia was filled with happiness.  
  
"Miss Hisui! I will treasure it for the rest of my life! Thank you very
much! And... I have a favor to ask..."  
"Yes."  
  
Hisui tilted her head slightly and looked up at Arcadia.  
  
"U, um! Would you dance with me at the party the day after tomorrow?"  
"Yes, if I'm good enough."  
  
Hisui answered immediately without any hesitation.  
Arcadia listened to the reply with disbelief. Arcadia was now filled
with the greatest happiness.  
  
â€”  
  
After that, Arcadia was also crushed by Aoi and was rolling on the floor
of The Whimsy.  
  
"Aoi, you haven't changed at all."  
"Aldey. Please take care of Arcadia."  
"I think well of that young man. Just like your partner..."  
"Hisui, does she realize that Arcadia confessed his love to her?"  
"It doesn't seem like she does."  
  
Aldey smiled happily as he recalled Hisui immediately accepting the
invitation from Arcadia earlier, and then,  
  
"Aoi, you wouldn't like Hisui being taken away, would you?"  
  
He asked Aoi.  
  
"Yeah, I wouldn't like it."  
  
Aoi replied with a sulky look on her face, looking genuinely
displeased.  
  
"I'm looking forward to the party the day after tomorrow."  
"Aldey is so mean..."  
  
Aldey laughed happily and downed the drink he was holding in one gulp.
