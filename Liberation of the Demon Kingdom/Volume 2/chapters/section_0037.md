# Chapter 66: I’ll Cherish You

After the party ended, Aoi and Hisui returned to The Whimsy they were
using as an inn. Once The Whimsy closed for business, all the employees
went home, so only Aoi and Hisui were staying there.  
  
"Aoi, are you angry?"  
  
After preparing for bed and changing from her dress into sleepwear,
Hisui asked Aoi.  
  
"Did I do something?"  
  
Hisui looked anxious.  
  
"Hisui, you danced three songs with Arcadia, right?"  
"Yes. What about it?"  
"Because dancing three songs means accepting their love, right?"  
"Huh? Why is that?"  
  
Aoi understood everything from Hisui's words.  
  
(I see. Hisui doesn't know.)  
  
"Hisui, dancing three songs means accepting the other person's love."  
"Eh? Is that so? I don't particularly like Arcadia. I'm grateful,
though."  
"Then, who do you like?"  
  
Hisui's eyes were clearly darting around.  
  
"W, well, I…"  
  
(I see. Hisui danced with Arcadia without knowing. That's so like
her.)  
  
Aoi felt relieved and, at the same time, wanted to tease Hisui a
little.  
Aoi put her hand on Hisui's head and gently stroked it.  
  
"Good girl, good girl…"  
"Aoi, what is it?"  
"I promised to dote on you, right?"  
  
Hisui pouted a little and looked at Aoi.  
  
"Doting is different…"  
"Then, what should I do?"  
  
Hisui's face turned bright red, and she looked down.  
  
"Aoi is mean."  
"What do you want me to do? Hisui?"  
  
Aoi put her arm around Hisui's shoulders and gently hugged her over her
sleepwear.  
  
"Aoi…"  
  
Hisui also hugged Aoi.  
  
"Aoi, you said you’d pamper me. I want you to do it like you did last
time."  
  
Hisui looked into Aoi's eyes and kissed her lips.  
  
"I love you, Aoi."  
  
Aoi shuddered at the sensation of Hisui's soft lips.  
  
"Hisui… well said."  
  
Aoi took off Hisui's jacket and hugged her.  
  
…  
  
Hisui felt a pleasure like an electric shock. That pleasure was repeated
over and over again. And then, unable to bear it, Hisui fainted.  
  
"Hisui?"  
  
Aoi put a sheet over the unconscious Hisui and gently embraced her.  
  
"Good night, Hisui."
