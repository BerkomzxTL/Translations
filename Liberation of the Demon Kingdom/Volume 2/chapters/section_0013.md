# Chapter 42: To the Capital!

"Mr. Onjin, I think it'd be better to wait before entering the
capital."  
"Yes. It smells quite fishy."  
  
After Aoi introduced Asain to Onjin, she explained the situation.  
  
"So, what are you going to do, Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui?"  
"Yes, we’ll go to the capital."  
"I think you two will be fine, but please be careful."  
  
Onjin and the members of the caravan were looking at Aoi and Hisui with
worried faces.  
  
"Thank you, Mr. Onjin, everyone. Asain's squad will be waiting here, so
I think the caravan will be safe... Gam! Make sure you protect the
caravan so you don't hold back the knights."  
"I understand, Miss Aoi."  
  
Gam answered cheerfully, but he couldn't hide his anxiety.  
  
"Jim, let's discuss the future when we get back."  
"Yes, Miss Hisui, please be careful too."  
  
"Alright, Mr. Asain. To the capital!"  
  
The three left the knights to wait with the caravan and headed for the
capital. Aoi and Hisui rode on Kamo, and Asain on Gamo.  
  
"Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. There is a place where you can enter the capital
without going through the checkpoint, so I’ll guide you through
there."  
  
A pass is required to go through the checkpoint, but in the current
situation, Aoi and Hisui's passes will be noticed. Even if they were to
force their way through, the checkpoint is a key location, so there are
many soldiers there even in peacetime. Therefore, they were planning to
avoid the checkpoint and infiltrate.  
  
"What were you planning to do after entering the capital?"  
"We will contact the Intelligence Division. My boss told me to contact
them..."  
  
Aoi said, showing Asain the letter from Amano.  
  
"The knights of the Barlmin territory attacked Miss Aoi and the others
in the royal capital?"  
"It seems so. However, we only have little information. Asain, could you
please accompany us to the Intelligence Division?"  
"Understood. I'm also worried about Marquis Barlmin."  
  
The three hurried to the capital, riding on their Gamou birds.
