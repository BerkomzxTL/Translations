# Chapter 51: Awakening

From the royal capital, a team of 15 elites from the "Intelligence
Division," led by Arcadia, was heading for the capital of the Barlmin
territory.  
However, they unexpectedly got held up at the checkpoint right before
the capital.  
  
"Why is it taking so long?"  
  
Arcadia and the others were disguised as a merchant caravan. Their
passes were under the affiliation of an actual trading company operated
by the Intelligence Division, so in a way, they were genuine.  
  
"They're spending a considerable amount of time checking the passes."  
"Arcadia, do you think we'll be okay?"  
"There shouldn't be anything suspicious about us. It’ll take time, but I
think we'll get through the checkpoint without any problems."  
  
Arcadia's team would be held up there for three hours.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui..."  
"Aoi, you're awake!"  
  
Aoi woke up before noon.  
  
"Are you in pain?"  
"Yeah, I got done in."  
  
Hisui was holding Aoi's hand tightly.  
  
"Hisui, you've been holding my hand the whole time."  
"Yes..."  
  
Hisui peered into Aoi's face.  
  
"I felt very safe. It's been a long time since I slept this well."  
  
Aoi said, while holding Hisui's hand back.  
  
"I made you worry."  
  
Tears welled up in Hisui's eyes.  
  
"You really did. I don't want to be apart from you anymore. Aoi. I want
to be together with you forever."  
  
Aoi touched Hisui's cheek.  
  
"Yeah."  
  
Hisui put her own hand over Aoi's hand that was touching her cheek.  
  
"The light user will be here soon. Just bear with it until then. Aoi, is
there anything you want?"  
"Ah, I want something sweet to drink, anything will do."  
"Understood. Please wait a moment."
