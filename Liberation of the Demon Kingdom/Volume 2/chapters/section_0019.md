# Chapter 48: Dragon Knight Aldey

(Hisui is worried about me. I have to go quickly.)  
  
Aoi tried to move her feet, but the muddy swamp beneath them prevented
her from moving forward. And the swamp got deeper and deeper,
threatening to sink her.  
  
(I have to go quickly!)  
  
At the same time Aoi screamed as intense pain assaulted her entire
body.  
  
"Ouch!"  
"You're awake?"  
"Where is this? What happened to me?"  
  
Aoi was lying on a bed she didn't recognize.  
  
"How long have I been asleep?"  
"It's just before dawn now. Aoi’s been asleep for about eight hours."  
"You? Why do you know my name?"  
  
The man took off the hood he was wearing. He looked to be about 60 years
old, with rugged features, but his right arm was missing from the
shoulder.  
  
"Aldey…"  
  
The man was Aldey the Dragon Knight, one of the Six Heroes.  
  
"I sensed a nostalgic dark magic, so I came to check it out and found
Aoi collapsed."  
"Thank you. You really saved me."  
  
Aoi replied weakly.  
  
"Aoi, your dark power hasn't returned yet, has it? To be done in like
this…"  
"Yeah, my dark magic is practically unusable."  
  
Aoi's voice sounded very mournful.  
  
"Buenos was your opponent?"  
"Yes. He's a formidable enemy. But I have to go. I can't leave the Order
alone... Aldey, I have a favor to ask."  
"What? I'll do almost anything Aoi asks of me."  
"My partner is at The Whimsy. Her name is Hisui. Please tell her that
I'm here."  
"Understood. Hisui, I'll bring Aoi's partner here."  
  
Aoi showed a relieved expression.  
  
"Thank you. I feel safe with Aldey with me."  
"Aoi, stay put until I get back."  
"Yeah, I can't move anyway…"  
  
Aldey put his hand on Aoi's forehead and quietly left the room.  
  
—  
  
Hisui was encouraged to get some sleep by Asain and Elliott, but she
couldn't sleep a wink. Soon, it would be morning.  
  
"Aoi…"  
Hisui wanted to rush to Aoi's side immediately. But she felt ashamed
that she couldn't.  
  
"Aoi…"  
  
How many times had she whispered that name? At that moment, Hisui felt
the atmosphere of the store change.  
  
(Even though the store is closed...)  
  
"Elliott, is something wrong?"  
  
Hisui called out to Elliott, who should have been in the next room, but
there was no reply. Hisui drew her Yagiri and woke Asain, who was
napping on a cot.  
  
"Mr. Asain, something's wrong."  
  
Asain immediately got up and took up his sword.  
  
"Elliott and someone are talking outside the store. The person who came
to visit is skilled."  
  
Hisui quietly approached the door and eavesdropped on the
conversation.  
  
"I want you to tell Hisui that I'm looking after Aoi."  
"What does that mean?"  
"It means exactly what it says."  
  
Hisui was horrified.  
  
(Looking after Aoi? Is this guy holding Aoi captive?!)  
  
Hisui kicked down the door and kneaded magicules into the ground,
creating a golem. Then, without asking any questions, she slammed the
golem into Aldey. Aldey deflected the attack with his left hand. The
golem lost its balance and collapsed. Immediately, Hisui swung her
Yagiri at Aldey. The slash was a fatal blow filled with Hisui's anger.
It looked as if the blade had severed Aldey's right hand, but in
reality, only the sleeve of Aldey's clothes was cut off and fluttered
away.  
  
(He doesn't have a right hand!)  
  
As soon as Hisui realized this, Aldey struck her body with magicules,
rendering her unable to move. Or rather, she shouldn't have been able to
move.  
  
"Give Aoi back!"  
  
It was a cry from Hisui's soul. Hisui's body, which shouldn't have been
able to move, began to tremble. And then Hisui stood up.  
  
"Between that previous attack and the willpower to stand, as expected,
Aoi chose well for her partner."  
  
Aldey muttered and then spoke to Hisui.  
  
"Please put away your sword. Aoi asked me to. She wants you to come and
get her. I'll guide you."  
"Who are you?"  
  
Aldey's answer to Hisui's question sent shivers down the spines of the
knights who were present.  
  
"I am known as the Dragon Knight."
