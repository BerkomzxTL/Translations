# Chapter 31: Preparation for Battle

The two decided to meet Onjin tomorrow morning.  
  
"Hisui, let's get a different inn."  
"I agree. I definitely feel a bad vibe. We're being watched."  
"Okay, then let's buy some food to go. I want to eat something
delicious."  
"Aoi, I want to try the river fish sandwich, a Barlmin specialty!"  
"Yeah, let's buy that! I want to drink alcohol too, but I guess I'll
have to refrain today..."  
  
The two of them took a different inn from Onjin. It was a room on the
second floor. They had left the two Gamou birds at the inn where Onjin
was staying.  
  
"First, let's go buy some food. Then we'll scout around."  
  
The Barlmin territory is located inland, and the fish caught in the
river are delicious. Their specialty is a sandwich made by frying river
fish in oil, sandwiching it between bread with vegetables, and topped
with a sweet and spicy sauce. The two bought cherry trout and char
sandwiches from a stall.  
  
"There's quite a number of them."  
"Yeah. Shall we move after we eat? I don't want to cause trouble for the
inn..."  
"I know... I want to try something."  
  
Hisui said that and took out a fist-sized stone from her pocket and
infused it with magicules. Then she shaped it,  
  
"It's a golem. Since it's small, I guess it's a mini-lem."  
  
She created a small golem. Hisui moved the mini-lem around and proudly
said to Aoi,  
  
"What do you think! Isn't it cute!"  
"Whoa! Amazing, Hisui! Let's defeat those guys with this!"  
"Yes, then let's get started right away."  
"No, no, it doesn't look like they’re going to move yet, so let's eat
first."  
"That's right. I'm getting hungry."  
"Let's go back to the inn and eat. I'm getting hungry too."  
  
After that, the two returned to the inn and ate the sandwiches. The
light flavor of the fish was coated with just the right amount of oil
from being fried, and it went very well with the vegetables and sweet
and spicy sauce.  
  
"Phew. That was delicious."  
"Yes, it really was!"  
"Haa, I want to take a bath and go to sleep as it is, but..."  
"It can't be helped."  
"Oh, they're gathering. There are about 30 of them, I guess. They're
well-trained."  
  
The inn was surrounded by many soldiers.  
  
"Hisui, can you use the mini-lem to neutralize the four people in the
next room first?"  
"Yes, I can."  
"After that, we'll break through the guys gathered around the inn and
head to the market square. Let's take them out there."  
"That's a rough plan..."  
"There doesn’t seem to be any particularly strong guys either. Okay,
then let's start the operation!"
