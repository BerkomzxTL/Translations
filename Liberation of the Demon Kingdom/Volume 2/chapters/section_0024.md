# Chapter 53: Hisui's Tears

"Aoi, are you alright?"  
  
Soon after, Aldey returned to the mansion.  
  
"Yes, Aldey. As you can see! I'm fine."  
"Have the dark magicules returned?"  
"Not completely."  
  
Aldey asked while looking at the broken window.  
  
"What happened?"  
  
Aoi told Aldey the whole story.  
  
"Then, is the balance of magicules restored?"  
"I think so... Not completely, though."  
"That's good. I didn't want to see Aoi fighting while sacrificing your
life."  
"It's a power with many sins, though."  
"No, no matter what power you have, it's about how you use it. In fact,
you and Hisui were saved by that power."  
  
Hisui felt a deep sense of relief as she listened to Aldey  
  
(I'm glad. I'm really glad.)  
  
Tears were streaming down Hisui's face.  
  
"Huh? I should be happy, but..."  
"Hisui."  
  
Aoi quietly stayed close to Hisui, who was softly crying.  
  
Just before evening, Aoi and the other two returned to The Whimsy.  
  
"Miss Aoi, are you alright?"  
  
Asain came running from the back.  
  
"Mr. Asain, I’m sorry I made you worry."  
"Nice to meet you. I'm Elliot, a B-Rank knight from the Intelligence
Division."  
"I'm Aoi from the Intelligence Division. I'll be in your care for a
while."  
  
Aoi lowered her head slightly.  
  
"I didn't know what to do when Lord Aldey rushed out."  
"Yeah, it was actually dangerous. There was a formidable enemy. But
Elliot, we want to know the whereabouts of Marquis Barlmin. If he's
alive, I’d like to rescue him."  
"Yes, we're investigating around Dista, but we haven't been able to find
out where he is."  
"I see..."  
"We have an idea of where the headquarters of the Order of Chaos is, so
we will continue the investigation. Also, it’s a little late, but 15
knights will be arriving from the royal capital today, so I think we can
spare some manpower."  
  
Just then, the sound of someone knocking on the shop door was heard.  
  
"I'd like to pick up Miss Amano's forgotten item..."  
  
"Hisui, doesn't that voice sound like Arcadia?"  
  
Aoi and Hisui looked at each other and nodded.
