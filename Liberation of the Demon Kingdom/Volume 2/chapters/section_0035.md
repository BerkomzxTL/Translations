# Chapter 64: Party

"It was fun!"  
"Aoi and the maids must have had fun."  
  
Aoi led the gloomy Hisui by the hand to the Magic District. And then,  
  
"Aoi, Aoi! Can I go see that shop over there! Oh, this toy carriage
moves when you inject magicules into it—wow. It's a tool for boiling
water. Aoi had one at her house in the royal capital, right?"  
  
Aoi watched Hisui, who was rattling off words in a rapid-fire manner,
with a smile.  
  
"Let's buy something as a souvenir."  
"I want matching necklaces!"  
  
Hisui seemed to have had her eye on something, as she strode
purposefully toward a shop without hesitation.  
  
"This! What do you think? Don't you think it's cute?"  
  
What Hisui showed Aoi was a necklace made of platinum inlaid with jewels
in the shape of an iris flower, attached to a delicate chain.  
  
"What do you think?"  
"It's cute. Okay, let's buy this!"  
  
Aoi chose one with turquoise, and Hisui chose one with jade embedded in
it.  
  
Light magic was engraved in the platinum filigree of the necklace, and
it shimmered in rainbow colors depending on the viewing angle.  
  
"Hisui, let's wear them to the party tomorrow."  
"Yes!"  
  
Hisui replied happily.  
  
—  
  
The next day, Aoi and Hisui visited the Marquis' residence in the
evening.  
  
"Welcome."  
  
After receiving a polite greeting from the head maid, the two were taken
to separate rooms to change. There, they changed into the dresses they
had chosen yesterday and had their makeup done by the maids.  
  
"Both of you are so cute, we're really putting our hearts into your
makeup."  
  
They had their hair done and makeup applied at the maids' discretion,
and then,  
  
"Oh, you're both so beautiful!"  
  
They were sent off to the party venue with the head maid's words of
admiration.  
Aoi and Hisui put on the matching necklaces they had bought yesterday
and opened the door leading to the venue.  
  
—  
  
Arcadia was restless and wandering around the party venue. The
buffet-style party had delicious food and drinks, the music played by
the orchestra was pleasant, and his fellow knights seemed to be enjoying
themselves. Arcadia was searching for Hisui even as he received thanks
and praise from Marquis Barlmin and the members of the Knights.  
  
(I wonder if Miss Hisui is here yet?)  
  
At that moment, the doors to the venue opened, and Aoi and Hisui
entered. Aoi wore a silver filigree tiara in her hair and a blue dress
with a daringly open neckline and shoulders, while Hisui had her hair
up, wore a delicate artificial flower hair ornament, and a green dress
with a short skirt that boldly showed off her healthy thighs.  
Both of them wore light makeup, and that simple application created a
healthy sex appeal. Both of them had iris flower necklaces dangling at
their chests.  
  
"Hoo."  
  
A sigh, which could be taken as either a sigh or an exclamation of
admiration, escaped from the venue. Arcadia couldn't take his eyes off
Hisui. He was called out by Vice Squad Leader Dogos, but he didn't hear
a thing. He thought that if Hisui was saved, he wouldn't begrudge giving
up his right arm.  
  
Aoi and Hisui were targeted not only by Arcadia but also by the men (and
occasionally women) in the venue. They were greeted non-stop by
gentlemen and ladies who wanted to get a little closer to them.  
  
(Ugh, Marquis! Help me!)  
  
The Marquis noticed Aoi's resentful gaze and restrained those gentlemen
and ladies.  
  
"Lady Aoi, Miss Hisui. Please taste the mountain delicacies and
beverages harvested from my territory. That area over there seems
spacious and nice."  
  
Aoi and Hisui thanked the Marquis for his consideration and took their
food and drinks to where the knights were gathered, guided by the
Marquis.
