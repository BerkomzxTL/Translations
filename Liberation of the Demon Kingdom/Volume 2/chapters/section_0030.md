# Chapter 59: After the Battle

"Arcadia!"  
  
Aoi rushed to Arcadia and cast healing magic. The wounds healed quickly,
but his right arm was gone from the elbow down.  
  
"Arcadia, thanks to you I was saved. Thank you."  
"No, I am content if the two of you are safe. Miss Aoi, could you please
heal the children and intelligence officers as well?"  
"Of course. Arcadia, get some rest!"  
  
Aoi treated the injured, including the children, and Hisui, along with
Vice Squad Leader Dogos, disarmed the Barlmin knights. Except for those
with Orb and Dista, the knights were unaware of Marquis Barlmin
situation and were simply following orders.  
Arcadia, rubbing the stump of his missing right arm, gazed at Hisui.  
  
(Ah, I can't return to being a Royal Knight anymore.)  
  
Arcadia thought so, but surprisingly, his heart felt clear.  
  
(I'm glad Miss Hisui is safe.)  
  
Arcadia was relieved from the bottom of his heart.  
  
—  
  
Fortunately, there were no fatalities on either side in the operation to
recapture Marquis Barlmin. The children had lost a lot of magicules, but
their lives were not in danger.  
  
"Arcadia, thank you so much. You protected Aoi's life. I don't know how
to thank you..."  
  
Arcadia's face went bright red as Hisui held his hand and thanked him
with tears in her eyes.  
Vice Squad Leader Dogos, who had been with him for a long time since he
joined the Royal Knights, was tempted to tease him when he saw this, but
he knew that Arcadia was in love with Hisui and that his actions this
time were for her sake, so he watched silently.  
  
"M-Miss Hisui. I am truly relieved that Miss Hisui is unharmed. I would
be happy to be Miss Hisui's shield."  
  
This was Arcadia's earnest and clumsy confession to Hisui, but Hisui is
also a girl who is oblivious to male affection.  
  
"No, Arcadia protected Aoi. Thank you."  
  
Her reply was slightly off.  
  
—  
  
When Marquis Barlmin woke up, Aoi was just arranging flowers in a
vase.  
  
"Where is this...?"  
"Marquis! How are you feeling?"  
"Have I died...? I’m seeing visions of Lady Aoi..."  
  
Marquis Barlmin slowly raised his upper body from the bed and stared at
Aoi again.  
  
"You haven't changed at all since that time... You're still just as
beautiful..."  
"I won't give you anything for complimenting me. But you seem to be
doing well."  
  
Aoi sat on the bed and put her hand on Marquis Barlmin's back.  
  
"Ah, it seems I am alive. I presume you have gone to great lengths for
me."  
"No, Mr. Asain and the knights of Barlmin and the royal capital did
their best. Actually, I was in danger. Everyone really helped me
out..."  
  
Marquis Barlmin nodded slowly and tried to get out of bed.  
  
"Hey, Marquis. Please rest."  
  
"No, Lady Aoi healed me, right? Then I'm fine! I can't just let my
subordinates do all the work. Someone! Call Asain immediately!"  
  
Aoi looked at the Marquis with concern, but she was relieved to see the
light in his eyes.  
  
"You seem to be doing well, Marquis."
