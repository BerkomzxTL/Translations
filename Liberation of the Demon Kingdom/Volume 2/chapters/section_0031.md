# Chapter 60: Invitation to a Party

After that, Marquis Barlmin took control of the Knights and reorganized
them. Orb, the commander, as well as the vice-commander and the knights
who had ties to the Order of Chaos, were all dismissed and placed under
house arrest. Marquis Barlmin himself assumed the position of commander
of the Barlmin territory knights, and he nominated Asain as the vice
commander.  
  
Dista and Orb were to be taken to the royal capital as criminals. Dista
and Orb had colluded to abduct children, especially demi-human children,
around the Great Forest and sell them to the Order of Chaos.  
The Order of Chaos exploited the fact that children's magicules were
prone to going out of control, extracting a large amount of magicules,
which they then used when replicating cursed swords. They also seemed to
be using them as test subjects for magic research such as the
demonization.  
  
"It seems the weapons were flowing into the Demon Continent. Lady Aoi,
if you plan on going to the Demon Kingdom, please, please be careful...
They must be planning to do something in the Demon Kingdom."  
  
Aoi tightened her resolve upon hearing Marquis Barlmin’s warning.

Arcadia had been instructed by Tsukumi, the commander of the Royal Guard
Knights, and Dr. Amano, to stay in the Barlmin territory for a while.
The Barlmin territory was originally a land where the manufacturing and
research of magical tools were thriving. Research on prosthetic arms is
also at the cutting edge even within the Asura Kingdom.  
Arcadia was tasked with finding an excellent prosthetic workshop to
provide compensation for those injured in battle, and to support it in
the name of the royal family. Arcadia was grateful for Tsukumi and
Amano's thoughtfulness.  
In addition, Arcadia hit it off with Aldey. This is probably because
they both had serious personalities. Aldey also agreed to help select
and support the prosthetic arm workshop. However,  
  
"I don't need a prosthetic arm."  
  
That's what he said.

The next day, Onjin and the members of the merchant caravan arrived at
the capital. They were busy selling magic stones and purchasing magical
tools, but Gam and Jim were bored.  
  
"Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui seem busy."  
"That's right. We can't see them at all."  
"But Jim, you're going to the Great Forest with Miss Hisui, right?"  
"Yeah, that's the plan."  
  
—  
  
Three days after rescuing Marquis Barlmin, Marquis Barlmin announced the
direction of the Knights' reorganization and the punishment of
criminals. There was still a mountain of work to be done in practice,
but an internal party was to be held to gather those who had
contributed.  
Aoi and Hisui were planning to leave the territory capital after the
aftermath was settled, so they decided to depart for the Great Forest
the day after the party.  
  
"Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. This is an invitation to the party from Marquis
Barlmin."  
  
The invitation that Asain brought was a special one, treating them as
VIPs.  
  
"Um, well, I don't have a dress, so could you change it to a normal
invitation?"  
  
Hisui made a flimsy statement, but Asain rejected it.  
  
"The party is the day after tomorrow, so please come to the lord's
residence tomorrow to choose a dress."  
  
Hisui made a pitiful face, but it didn't work on Asain.  
  
"It's an internal party, so please don't be too intimidated. Oh, yes, we
also have dances prepared, so if you have a gentleman in mind, please
let us know in advance."  
  
Hisui looked at Aoi and tried to say something, but gave up after
looking at Asain.  
  
"Please don't hesitate to tell me, okay?"  
  
Hisui groaned and looked back and forth between Aoi and Asain, then,  
  
"I'm fine..."  
  
She replied in a voice that was almost inaudible.
