# Chapter 52: Awakening

Hisui saw that plums were ripening in the mansion's garden. Hisui's
mother used to make her a drink of plum juice with honey when she caught
a cold.  
  
(That's right. I'll make that for Aoi.)  
  
Hisui decided to pick plums in the mansion's garden.  
  
(Aoi, just wait for me.)  
  
It was by chance. Jules happened to find Hisui picking plums in the
mansion's garden.  
  
(It's her!!)  
  
He'd never forget! One of the little brats who inflicted tremendous
humiliation on Jules!  
  
(Found her. Where's the other one?)  
  
Jules used wind magic to scan the surroundings.  
  
(What? There are hardly any magicules left! Little brat, I'll kill
you!)  
  
Jules used wind magic to move at high speed to the location where he
detected Aoi. He created a bullet of air, broke the window, and jumped
into the room.  
  
(Magic? In Aoi's room!)  
  
Hisui immediately sensed the presence and rushed over. But Jules reached
Aoi a moment faster.  
  
"Aoi!"  
"Don't move!"  
  
Jules said to Hisui, pointing his sword at Aoi.  
  
"I'll avenge the humiliation I suffered last time.”  
"Stop it. Please. Please stop."  
"Hahaha, just stand there and watch her die in agony!"  
  
Jules released an air blade at Hisui, who couldn't resist, inflicting a
wound on her right arm. The plums Hisui was holding in her right hand
fell to the floor.  
  
"Ugh."  
"Stop it! Don't lay a hand on Hisui."  
"What, you. Are you ordering me? I've changed my mind. First, I'll strip
her naked, torture her, and then kill her. Then it's your turn."  
  
As Jules said that, he created a vortex of wind around Hisui. The wind
magic tore Hisui's shirt, exposing her underwear. Then, blood splattered
from her skin.  
  
"Stop it! Hisui!"  
"Aoi, I'm fine, so don't move!"  
"That's right! You don't move either!! How about this?"  
  
Jules' wind magic increased in power. Hisui's clothes were torn to
shreds, and her skin was cut to pieces.  
  
"Aah!"  
"Stop it!!"  
It was sudden. Aoi's right hand was enveloped in dark, dark darkness.
Then, Jules was suddenly slammed against the wall and pinned there.  
  
"I, I can't move!"  
  
Jules felt terror from the bottom of his heart. Aoi floated in the air,
looking down at Jules. The wounds Aoi had sustained had disappeared
completely.  
  
"A, a, a."  
  
Aoi's form felt like something inhuman. She was an object of beauty,
transience, and awe. And,  
  
The last thing Jules felt was being enveloped in a dark darkness, a
sensation of his entire body being crushed.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui!"  
  
Aoi rushed over to the battered Hisui and healed her. Hisui's wounds
disappeared in an instant.  
  
"Hisui!"  
  
Aoi hugged Hisui tightly.  
  
"Aoi, it hurts..."  
"Yeah, but..."  
  
Aoi hugged Hisui's body tightly, as if confirming her existence.  
  
"Aoi, your dark magicules returned."  
"Yeah."  
"The wounds on your body are back to normal too."  
"Yeah."  
"Aoi, it hurts..."  
"Yeah."  
  
Hisui hugged Aoi back tightly in return, as if confirming her
existence.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui, that's a very provocative look."  
  
Hisui's chest was hidden by the magic armor, but her lower body was
almost completely uncovered, practically naked.  
  
"N, no, don't look!"  
"Yup, what a beautiful ass! I'm glad there aren't any scars left!"  
"I'll get angry."  
  
Aoi gently approached Hisui and softly embraced her.  
  
"Hisui, thank you so much. And I'm sorry for worrying you."  
"Aoi, I'll say it again and again. Please don't leave me anymore. I want
us to be together forever."  
  
After changing into the clothes in Aldey's mansion, Hisui sat on the bed
where Aoi had been sleeping. Aoi also sat next to her.  
  
"Is that dark magic?"  
"Yeah. It's pretty advanced magic, so I can't use it unless I
concentrate. I call it Black Hole. It crushes the target with super-high
gravity and throws them into another dimension."  
"... "  
"My dark magic was transferred from Luke. Magic stained with sad,
pitiful sins. But I won't hesitate to use it to protect what's important
to me. It’s a power that resides in Hisui too, but it's up to Hisui
whether or not to use it."  
"Yes. If I were in the same situation, I wouldn't hesitate to use it to
protect what's important to me."  
  
Hisui rested her head on Aoi's shoulder.  
  
"Aoi, I said I'd take half of your suffering. I meant it."
