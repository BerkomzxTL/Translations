# Chapter 94: Aoi's Way

"Since then, all I could think about was defeating Luke. To get Sheema
back. After that, I acted together with Aoi and the others.  
But even now that Luke is defeated, Sheema hasn't returned. At that
time, I think the dark magic in the Sugal Plains was Sheema's power. Is
she being manipulated by the Order? Is it her own will? I don't know,
but I believe Sheema is still alive."  
  
The Demon Queen didn't know the whereabouts of her child, but she didn't
doubt that she was alive.  
  
"Thank you for the painful story, Dustis. But if the Order of Chaos'
goal is to seal the Demon Continent, why aren't they using Sheema as a
shrine maiden?"  
  
This was the question that Hisui thought of after hearing Sheema's
story.  
  
"But there's been no such movement. What if the Order of Chaos, or
rather, Buenos' goal, is different from Luke's? I can't help but think
that..."  
  
Hisui couldn't gauge Dustis' uneasy feelings. The desire to protect
what's important, the kingdom, the responsibility as a queen, and the
unreadable goals of the Order of Chaos.  
  
(Can I be as strong as Miss Dustis?)  
  
"Dustis. But our goal is to free this Demon Continent from Luke's sins.
I don't know what the Order is plotting, but…  
That won't change, right? Besides, if there's a trace of Sheema in the
Order, I'll do everything I can to get her back."  
"Thank you, Aoi."  
  
Dustis continued speaking while holding back tears.  
  
"I couldn't talk to Aoi about Sheema. To you, Luke's daughter... When I
first met Aoi, I hated you so much I wanted to kill you. You, the
daughter of Luke who kidnapped Sheema...  
But you know, even though you loved Luke as a daughter, I didn't want to
tell Aoi my situation, who was struggling to defeat Luke.  
Because I immediately grew to like Aoi as a friend.  
I knew you would end up carrying Sheema's burden as another of Luke's
sins. I'm sorry."  
  
Dustis said that much and then burst into tears.  
  
"Dustis, thank you. But you know, I have to bear all of Luke's sins.
That includes Sheema! I'll risk my life to save Sheema! Otherwise, I
can't die in peace!!"  
  
Aoi said as if shouting while clenching her fist.  
  
"No! Aoi! No..."  
  
And then,  
  
\*Slap\*  
  
Aoi had been slapped on the cheek by Hisui.  
  
"Doesn't Aoi understand Miss Dustis' feelings?  
I'll say it again and again! You are Aoi, not Luke!  
Miss Dustis didn't want you to bear Sheema's burden. She didn't want you
to become reckless. She didn't want you to feel responsible.  
Let's all look for Sheema together. Let's all help her. It's not
something for you to bear alone..."  
  
Hisui slapped Aoi's cheek again.  
  
"Besides, I hate people who don't value their lives... I hate you,
Aoi..."  
  
—  
  
That day, Aoi holed up in the room she had been given. Hisui's words
sunk in.  
  
(Ah, I'm still trapped by Luke after all...)  
  
And then, she recalled the past.  
  
(Did Sheema put the seal on the Demon Continent in the Sugal Plains? I
couldn't become a shrine maiden because I have a strong light affinity,
which is the opposite of darkness. I'm an "flawed" shrine maiden. If
that's the case, then Sheema is my substitute!)  
  
Aoi was in agony. She thought Hisui's words were the most reasonable.
She was also grateful for Dustis' feelings. But...  
  
(What should I do...?)  
  
\*Knock knock\*  
  
The sound of knocking was heard,  
  
"Aoi, may I come in?"  
  
Dustis' voice was heard.  
  
"Yeah, you can..."  
"Aoi, I wanted to talk..."  
"Yeah..."  
"Miss Hisui. She was crying..."  
"I see..."  
"Aoi, are you an idiot?"  
  
Dustis' sharp gaze caught Aoi.  
  
"Why are you prioritizing your own feelings when it comes to the Order
of Chaos?"  
"My feelings?"  
"That's right. You're just carrying Luke's sins and feeling good about
it! Isn't it the same as self gratification? That’ll just make everyone
unhappy. Please... it's not something for you alone to bear. Please
understand..."  
  
Dustis stared at Aoi without hiding the tears streaming down her
cheeks.  
  
"Have a proper talk with Miss Hisui. Understood?"  
  
With that, Dustis left the room.
