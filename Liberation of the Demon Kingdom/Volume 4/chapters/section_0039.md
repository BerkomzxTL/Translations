# Chapter 124: Killer Bee

"I'm back."  
  
When Hisui and the others returned to the tower's entrance, the sun was
just about to set.  
  
"Welcome back! How was it?"  
"Yes, most of the holes where air was leaking have been sealed. As
expected of Miss Hisui!"  
  
Luca replied with admiration.  
  
"No, I think Luca's spatial detection ability is what's truly
amazing."  
  
Aoi nodded, then deliberately approached the tower's entrance and
activated dark magic.  
  
"We should have results by tomorrow morning."  
  
The magic Aoi used was a method of spreading dark magicules as a
poison.  
  
"I'm sorry to Hisui and Luca, but tomorrow morning we'll undo the sealed
air holes and then start the dungeon strategies. You two should relax
for today.  
Ah, Mao, good job too."  
"Miss Aoi, you forgot about me, didn't you? So meeeean."  
  
Hisui peeled Mao off Aoi while nodding.  
  
"Yes, we'll do that tomorrow. Mao, you're coming in the morning, too."  
"Aww, Hisui's cold too..."  
"That's because you're clinging to Aoi!!"  
"Eh, it’s not okay to cling a little?"  
"No way. Come on, get away!!"  
  
Aoi stared at the two who had started flirting with a slightly envious
gaze.  
  
"Come on, it's early tomorrow, so let's eat and rest."  
  
—  
  
The next day, Hisui and Luca went around unsealing the air holes early
in the morning. Mao was acting as a guard.  
  
"Alright, now it's back to normal."  
"There's no sign of bugs coming out. I'll use spatial detection magic at
the tower's entrance."  
  
Returning to the tower's entrance, Luca immediately probed the inside of
the tower.  
  
"How is it?"  
"Hmm, there are five large reactions remaining."  
"One of those reactions might be the guardian beast. Okay, everyone,
let's go."  
  
The inside of the tower was silent. There were piles of dead insects
everywhere.  
  
"Ugh... so that's why this is difficult to strategize. You can't plan
for this without a dark magic user, can you?"  
  
There were traps in some places, such as moving walls, but they were
designed to be dealt with  alongside swarms of insects, so they weren't
a threat.  
  
"If there were no bugs, this would just be a maze."  
  
Mikazuchi muttered while mapping.  
  
"Miss Aoi, there are two reactions in the passage a few dozen meters
ahead."  
"Everyone, draw your weapons. Here they come. Force, stay back for
support in case of poison, Mao, go left, I'll break through on the
right. Everyone else, support with magic as needed!"  
  
Appearing from the passage were two large, 1m-sized bees, Killer Bees.
Aoi and Mao charged at their respective Killer Bees.  
  
"They're fast!"  
  
Aoi tried to close the distance to strike with Nijimaru, but the Killer
Bee's movements were incredibly fast.  
  
"Tch."  
  
She attacked with blades of light, but the Killer Bee's movements were
too fast to hit.  
  
"Then!"  
  
Aoi created countless arrows of light and fired them at the Killer Bee
in a continuous, shotgun-like barrage.  
The Killer Bee tried to resist, but its movement was restricted. Then,
Mikazuchi's fire arrow pierced the Killer Bee's abdomen from behind. Aoi
quickly closed the distance to the Killer Bee and decapitated it with
Nijimaru.  
  
Mao was reading the Killer Bee's movements. Moreover, Mao was surpassing
the Killer Bee's swift movements. She enveloped her body in wind magic,
and was outmaneuvering the Killer Bee like the wind itself.  
  
"Ha!"  
  
Mao ran up the wall of the passage, then kicked off the wall and closed
in on the Killer Bee. Then she cut off its wings with a wind magic
sword. The Killer Bee lost its balance and fell to the ground. Hisui
created multiple stone spears with magic and skewered the fallen Killer
Bee's chest. Mao landed in front of the skewered Killer Bee.  
  
"Mao!! Be careful!!"  
  
The next moment after Hisui warned Mao, the Killer Bee fired a poisonous
stinger at Mao from its abdomen. It was an unavoidable, sure-kill
distance.  
  
"Mao!!"  
  
Hisui's scream echoed through the passage.
