# Chapter 87: Demon Kingdom

**Volume 4: The Demon Kingdom**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How much time has passed? It felt like an instant, yet also like a long
time.  
Aoi and the others found themselves inside a dark, stone building. Hisui
and Mao were weighed down by the feeling of heavy magicules clinging to
their bodies.  
  
"Aoi, have we arrived at the Demon Continent?"  
  
It was when Hisui called out to Aoi.  
A middle-aged swordsman opened the door and entered. In his hand, he
held a massive magic sword.  
  
"Hisui, Mao. Don't interfere."  
  
Aoi said sharply as she unsheathed Dark Cutter. Aoi infused magicules
into Dark Cutter and rushed towards the swordsman in one go, sliding
under his feet.  
Then, she slashed upwards in one motion from below. The swordsman
defended against the attack without moving from his spot, using his
greatsword, and then swung the greatsword up and slammed it down on
Aoi.  
The clash of swords was tremendous, and countless cracks appeared in the
stone floor from just the pressure of the sword. But Aoi saw the attack
coming and dodged it by simply tilting her body.  
She then took distance from the swordsman with a backstep and gathered
dark magicules in her right hand, shaped them into a blade, placed them
on the blade of Dark Cutter, and released it towards the swordsman.  
  
"!!"  
  
Hisui was surprised. The swordsman infused magicules into his greatsword
and, like Aoi, released "Dark Magic" as a blade. The two dark magic
spells collided and burst apart.  
  
"Miss Aoi, your dark magicules have returned."  
  
The swordsman returned his greatsword to the sheath on his back and
called out to Aoi. Aoi also sheathed Dark Cutter.  
  
"Hisui, Mao. This person is the Demon General Shurak. A user of
darkness. It's been a while, I'm glad you're doing well."  
"Miss Aoi, the same to you. My wife was worried because you were doing
reckless things on the Sugal Plains."  
"Ah, I made Dustis worry, didn't I."  
  
Hisui and Mao exchanged glances.  
  
(Queen Dustis is his wife? Queen Dustis' husband??)  
  
Hisui had heard of the Demon General Shurak's martial prowess. His fame
was comparable to that of Tsukumi, the leader of the Asura Kingdom's
Knights. It was the first time Hisui had heard that the Demon General
Shurak was married to Queen Dustis.  
  
"Ah, it's a secret that Shurak and Dustis are married, okay? Keep it a
secret, a secret."  
"Yes, well, that's fine, but..."  
"Now then, Shurak. Let me meet Dustis."  
  
â€”  
  
Guided by Shurak, Aoi and the others walked through the stone castle.
They passed several humans and demi-humans along the way, and Mao was a
little nervous.  
  
"Hisui... everyone is strong..."  
  
Just as Mao said, everyone they passed in the castle was clad in
powerful magicules.  
  
"To counter the miasma-like magicules that permeate the Demon Continent,
you have no choice but to strengthen your own magicules and wear them.
You have to become strong..."  
  
Shurak muttered as if to himself. Aoi wore a complicated expression.  
  
"Now then, this way."  
  
Shurak stood in front of a heavy door and knocked three times. A voice
called out from inside, and Shurak quietly opened the door.
