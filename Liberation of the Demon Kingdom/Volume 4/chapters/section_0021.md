# Chapter 106: The Devil's Work

Inside the tower Morse led them to was a dark, damp dining hall, just
the sort of place spirits would love.  
In the center was a large table, with chairs prepared for each person.
Aoi promptly told everyone to sit down, and then sat next to Morse
herself.  
Everyone took their seats as they pleased.  
  
"Morse, I'll get straight to the point. Is the engraving circle in the
Demon Capital a conversion circle for dark magicules that Dullahan
commanded to be set up during the Magic Kingdom era?"  
"Yes, Lady Aoi. That is correct."  
  
Aoi nodded deeply. It was the answer she expected.  
  
"Why didn't Luke destroy that engraving? It's what Luke hated the
most."  
"Yes, that circle is still operating, albeit subtly. Lord Luke adjusted
it that way.  
Inside, the body of Lady Mirei, a woman who looks exactly like you, is
enshrined."  
  
Aoi made a grim expression. It was an unexpected answer.  
A woman who looks exactly like Aoi. Luke's fiancée.  
  
"That engraving circle gathers an extremely small amount of magicules,
converts them into dark magicules, and covers Lady Mirei's coffin.  
To prevent the light magicules inside Lady Mirei from leaking out."  
"What's the meaning of that?"  
"As long as Lady Mirei's magicules don't run out, Lady Mirei's body will
not decay."  
  
Tears streamed down Aoi's cheeks. Luke could have destroyed the
engraving circle, but *'didn't destroy it'* ! To prevent the image of
his beloved from decaying!  
He sealed the Demon Continent, burdened with the sins of sealing, even
at the cost of afflicting many residents!!  
  
"The final seal placed on the Sugal Plains was placed by Princess
Susano's elder sister who resides there.  
Lady Aoi, your light power was too strong. If you had placed the seal,
it could have affected Lady Mirei's light magicules. Therefore, Lord
Luke used Lady Sheema, who possesses only pure dark magicules, to
complete the final seal.  
Lord Luke also possessed light magicules within himself, so he could not
place the seal personally."  
"So that's why I couldn't become a shrine maiden! That's why I was a
*‘failure’* !!"  
  
Hisui remembered the words Aoi had told her before.  
  
*'I'm a "failure"'*  ※  
  
"Can the engraving circle be destroyed?"  
"Yes, it is possible. However, to do so, all seals up to the 7th seal
must be undone. After that, the method for destroying the engraving
circle is. ---."  
  
Morse explained the method for destroying the circle in detail.  
  
"So the seals that Luke placed were to prevent the circle from being
used and to protect Mirei's coffin..."  
  
Aoi wiped away her tears with her sleeve and looked around at
everyone.  
  
"I'm going to undo the seals and destroy the engraving circle."  
  
It was a heartfelt determination from Aoi. And then, Aoi continued
speaking.  
  
"The Demon Kingdom must be liberated!"  
  
The members of α Squad were excited by these words. Hisui was also happy
with Aoi's decision.
