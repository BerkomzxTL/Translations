# Chapter 128: Just the Two of Us

Late that night, Aoi was in the lower basement of the royal castle.
There, Morse the Lich was kneeling, waiting for Aoi.  
  
"Morse, thank you. Thank you for taking on the defense here."  
"No, Lady Aoi. It is no trouble at all. Lady Aoi?"  
"Ah, it's nothing. Morse, I'm counting on you to look after the Demon
City."  
  
Morse remained kneeling, staring at Aoi with his lightless eyes.  
  
"I apologize for speaking out of turn, but... Lady Aoi, your face has
the look of death upon it."  
"Ah, I know."  
"Are you going to the 7th Seal?"  
"That's an obvious question."  
"That tower is different from the others. It emits a powerful curse.
Isn't it dangerous?"  
  
Aoi gave a lonely smile.  
  
"Luke told me about it. There are no magic beasts in that tower.
Dispelling the curse will be easy."  
  
Morse stood up and spoke to Aoi with a slightly stronger tone.  
  
"That's right. The 7th Seal places a powerful curse on anyone who breaks
it. If you know that, then why..."  
"I want to free the Demon Kingdom. That's all. Besides, I should be able
to defend against the curse. If I use the Dragon Armament.  
With such a strong defense in place, the curse won't reach me."  
"Perhaps, but..."  
  
Morse felt Aoi's strong resolve.  
  
"I understand. While Lady Aoi is away, I will take responsibility and
protect this place. But only while Lady Aoi is away. I will be waiting
for your quick return."  
  
Aoi nodded and quietly left the area.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui! Let's go into this shop. I feel an amazing amount of
magicules."  
  
Aoi and Hisui had been walking through the Demon City since morning. The
ominous atmosphere hadn't changed, but the soldiers paid their respects
to Aoi and Hisui, so the two didn't feel uncomfortable.  
That day, Hisui was wearing a bright sky-blue dress and a necklace that
Aoi had bought for them both in the Barlmin capital.  
  
"Definitely! Amazing magicules."  
  
Hisui cautiously opened the door to the shop.  
  
"Wow, Aoi, look! Magic tools from an era even older than the Magic
Kingdom!"  
  
Hisui infused magicules and gazed at a lamp that made shadow puppets
appear with a warm glow.  
  
"Old pictures. Seeing them like this, people's lives haven't changed,
whether now or in the past."  
  
The shadows on the lamp depicted a family surrounding a dining table.  
  
"Yes. People go in circles. Hey, Aoi. The curse covering the Demon
Continent is an unnatural force that cuts off that cycle. I sincerely
want to dispel the curse and circulate happiness like in these shadow
pictures."  
  
As she looked at Hisui's profile, Aoi savored Hisui's words.  
  
"Circulation of happiness, huh...? That's right. Hisui. It's just a
little further. Just a little more, please lend me your strength."  
"Aoi, what are you saying? I want to be your strength forever, Aoi."  
"I see. That's right. Thank you, Hisui."  
  
The magic lamp turned around and around, projecting one happy shadow
picture after another.  
  
—  
  
That day, Aoi and Hisui toured various places in the Demon City. A magic
stone sales office, a market, a cafeteria, a shop handling traditional
clothing, and a magic tool shop.  
Hisui was having fun. Seeing an unfamiliar city with Aoi, making new
discoveries. Hisui had no doubt that this happiness would become
universal by liberating the Demon Kingdom.  
Fun times pass quickly. Before they knew it, the sun was already
beginning to sink below the horizon.  
  
"Aoi! Look! Such a beautiful sunset."  
  
The magicules that had covered the Demon City had been greatly reduced
by dispelling six seals. With the magicules that had been drifting
hazily like mist diminished, the air was clear, and the blue sky,
sunset, and starry sky were very beautiful.  
  
"This scenery was created by Aoi. I'm very proud."  
  
Hisui's face, saying that with a little embarrassment, was illuminated
by the setting sun. Aoi found the scene very dazzling.  
  
"Yeah. It's what the thoughts and power of various people have
accomplished."  
  
"Even so. It wouldn't have started without Aoi. That's what I think. It
was Aoi who showed me this scenery. Thank you."  
  
Aoi took a package out of her bag and handed it to Hisui.  
  
"What is it?"  
"Try opening it."  
  
It was the magic lamp that projected shadow pictures.  
  
"Wow... I'm so happy. It's the lamp we saw earlier."  
  
Hisui picked up the lamp and turned the shadow pictures around and
around.  
  
"It was expensive, so take good care of it."  
"Yes, thank you very much! I'll treasure it!"  
  
Watching Hisui's happy face, Aoi renewed her resolve.  
  
(I will liberate the Demon Kingdom. I won't let the Order of Chaos do as
they please. I will protect Hisui.)
