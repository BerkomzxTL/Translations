# Chapter 123: The 6th Seal

"Now, the 6th seal!"  
  
Aoi and the others, having seen off Marsim, arrived at the 6th seal half
a day later.  
  
"Unlike the other seals, the magicules are dense, but it's in a normal
forest."  
"Yeah, that's right. Luca, could you scout inside the tower for a
bit?"  
  
With that said, Aoi sliced off the entrance of the tower with Darkness
Cutter.  
  
"Yes, then."  
  
Luca activated wind magic at the entrance of the tower.  
  
"This is... There are a lot of monsters lurking... Not a thousand, tens
of thousands, no, hundreds of thousands..."  
"What do you mean?"  
"Hmm. I'll just go in and see."  
  
Aoi clad her body in dark magicules and stepped into the entrance.  
  
"I'll support you too."  
  
Hisui also donned the Dragon Armament and followed Aoi.  
  
"I'll turn on the lights."  
  
Aoi lit the way with light magic.  
  
"There's nothing in particular..."  
  
Aoi and Hisui carefully advanced into the tower.  
  
"Aoi, I have a very bad feeling..."  
"Ah--. Hisui, don't set up a flag. I'm thinking the same thing right
now..."  
  
Rustle. Rustle.  
  
"Eek--"  
  
Just as the floor seemed to ripple, a massive swarm of "insects" of
various sizes rushed towards Aoi and Hisui.  
  
"Hisui, retreat! Retreat!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui hurriedly tried to return to the entrance.  
  
"Gogogogogo"  
  
With an eerie sound, the walls began to move, trying to block Aoi and
Hisui's path.  
  
"Hmph!"  
  
Hisui used earth magic to seal the walls' movement.  
  
"Let's hurry!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui rushed out of the tower, out of breath.  
  
"Hisui! Put the lid on! Lid!"  
  
Hisui hurried and sealed the entrance of the tower that Aoi had sliced
off.  
  
"Eek--. What should we do! I can't do it!"  
  
The members of α Squad were surprised.  
  
(What kind of monster is it that Miss Aoi can't handle...?)  
  
"Hisui, what was inside?"  
"Bugs! So many bugs! Ugh, Mao. What should we do?"  
"Eh--, bugs..."  
  
For Mao, who grew up in the Great Forest, bugs weren't particularly
repulsive.  
  
"Shall we burn them?"  
  
Mikazuchi answered, but Hisui shook her head.  
  
"No, there are so many bugs. If we burn them, we'll run out of
oxygen..."  
"Miss Aoi, when we exterminate bugs in our houses in the Great Forest,
we often dry and smoke wild grasses... I didn't like it because it
smelled bad."  
"Aoi! That's it. Can't you use dark magic to use poison somehow?"  
"But... It's not a closed room, is it?"  
"It might take some time, but if Luca reads the air currents and I go
around sealing the air vents with earth magic..."  
"Luca. What do you think?"  
"It's not impossible. Based on the sense I got from scouting earlier,
the tower is centered around a radius of 800m and goes 5 floors
underground. Miss Hisui should be able to close it off sufficiently,
shouldn't she?"  
  
Hisui nodded and donned the Dragon Armament.  
  
"Everyone, please give me some time. I'll go around the tower with Luca
and close it off."  
"I'll go too. It's better to have an escort, right?"  
  
Hisui, Mao, and Luca stood up at once. Luca closed her eyes and used
spatial detection magic.  
  
"Hmm, there's a large opening. The air is flowing..."  
"Miss Luca, let's go."  
"Then, please. Everyone, let's check the supplies for now."  
  
—  
  
"Let's close them off one by one for now. Miss Luca, how about around
here first?"  
"Yes, it's about a 15m radius."  
  
It was a small hill with exposed rock.  
  
"The air is flowing underground from around here. The air outlet is...
ah. It's near that big tree."  
"Okay, then I'll close it off."  
  
Hisui poured magicules into the ground and transformed the stones to
cover the rock surface.  
  
"Phew. How is it? Miss Luca."  
"Yes, the inflow of air from around here is gone. Excellent!"  
  
Hisui nodded and looked towards the large tree.  
  
"Miss Luca, something's moving..."  
"Miss Hisui, hurry! Let's quickly seal the air outlet too!"  
  
Hisui put Luca on the Dragon Armament and jumped up at once. Mao
followed behind.  
  
(To keep up with the full power me wearing the Dragon Armament... Mao's
speed is amazing.)  
  
In a few moments, the three arrived at the air outlet.  
  
"Ah, bugs are coming out!!"  
  
From that place, centipede-like monsters about 80cm long were crawling
out in droves.  
  
"Miss Hisui! Close the lid! Close it!"  
  
Luca shouted, and Hisui quickly used earth magic.  
  
"It's sealed... but let's deal with the ones that came out..."  
  
Hisui lowered Luca and drew Yagiri.  
  
"Um, Miss Hisui. I'll spin them up in a tornado and shred them, so leave
it to me."  
"Then, I'll do the cutting."  
  
Luca gathered magicules in her hands and created wind. The wind
gradually grew stronger, engulfing the insects and becoming a tornado.
Mao blasted the tornado with wind magic. The wind magic that Mao
unleashed became vacuum blades and shredded the insects.  
"Phew. Made it in time. Miss Luca, are there any other holes?"  
"The big holes are these two. There are three more small ones."  
"Let's close them off in order."  
"That's right. There's no telling if more bugs will come out, so we
should close them off quickly."  
  
Hisui carried Luca on the Dragon Armament and ran towards the location
that Luca specified.
