# Chapter 93: Twins

Aoi, Hisui, and Dustis were discussing how to release the barrier.  
  
"Yes, I understand what Aoi is saying. The Demon Kingdom's Knights will
handle seals 1 through 5. Aoi and the others will take care of seals 6
and 7..."  
"Dustis, there's something I'd like to ask you."  
"What is it?"  
"About the Sugal Plains."  
  
Dustis straightened her back and faced Aoi.  
  
"At that time, a great magic spell of darkness and wind was activated.
Did Susano activate that dark magic?"  
  
Dustis shook her head weakly.  
  
"It wasn't?"  
"Not Susano."  
  
Then she looked back at Aoi and Hisui and squeezed out the words.  
  
"I think it was my daughter, Sheema."  
"Dustis, would you tell us about it?"  
  
It was the story of Sheema, Susano's twin sister.  
  
â€”  
  
Dustis and Shurak were in love. They were strongly attracted to each
other as people who sought to protect the unique Demon Kingdom. The two
of them had children. Twin girls.  
The twins, who inherited Shurak's blood, had the potential to use dark
magic. A very strong dark affinity. It didn't take long for Luke to find
out about their existence.  
And... that day. Dustis and Shurak were surrounding their children,
spending a long-awaited family moment together.  
  
"Sheema, Susano. Today is your third birthday. I'm so happy that you've
grown up so much."  
  
Dustis shed tears at the growth of her children. Shurak gently watched
over Dustis. The twins were frolicking, feeling the happy atmosphere.  
  
"Shurak. I'm happy. But as a princess of the Demon Kingdom, I feel I
have to release the seals of the Demon Kingdom for the sake of these
children."  
  
Shurak gently embraced Dustis' shoulders. The two were happy. Although
it was a unique environment in the Demon Kingdom, they were blessed with
two children. However, this happiness was suddenly pulled away.  
It was quickly. A hole opened in the door, and a man entered the room.
To kidnap the child with dark magicules.  
  
"What! You!"  
  
Dustis and Shurak gathered magicules and fired them towards Luke.
However, both Dustis' ice arrows and Shurak's dark magic attacks were
devoured by the magic sword that Luke swung.  
  
"Who are you!"  
  
Dustis and Shurak combined their magicules and rushed towards Luke.
However, Dustis and Shurak were pinned to the floor by Luke's gravity
magic.  
Dustis desperately resisted. Putting her life on the line. To protect
her children.  
However, Luke's power was overwhelming. Neither Dustis nor Shurak could
move.  
  
"I'll take this child."  
  
Luke's words were tantamount to a death sentence for Dustis and Shurak.
Luke held Sheema.  
  
"Wait. Please, give me back my child!"  
  
Dustis' heartfelt cry only rang out pitilessly.
