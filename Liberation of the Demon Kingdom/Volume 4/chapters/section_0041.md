# Chapter 126: The 6th Seal Lifted!

"Here it comes!"  
  
Aoi issued a warning, and at the same moment, the giant centipede's
abdomen burst open, and a dragonfly-like magic beast flew out. Aoi
brandished Nijimaru and slashed at the magic beast.  
  
"!"  
  
The beast narrowly dodged Aoi's Nijimaru strike. It slipped past Aoi.  
  
"Tch."  
  
Fresh blood splattered from Aoi's shoulder.  
  
"Aoi!"  
"I'm okay! There's another one. Be careful."  
  
Aoi sharply warned everyone.  
  
"Miss Aoi, that's a Nyoi. It's fast. They act as a pair, male and
female."  
  
Zilberk knew this magic beast. A troublesome beast that lives in his
homeland's forest. The slow-moving dwarves were helplessly attacked by
the Nyoi.  
  
"Hisui, use Dragon Armament for resistance. Mao, can you keep up?"  
"Maybe evenly matched??"  
"That's enough!! Everyone, attack with magic if you can get a shot."  
  
Aoi created countless arrows of light and continuously fired them at the
Nyoi. However, the Nyoi dodged this attack with its swift movements.  
  
"They're fast after all!!"  
"Aoi, the giant centipede's chest!"  
  
As Hisui shouted, another Nyoi flew out from the giant centipede's
chest. Hisui hurriedly defended.  
  
"Too late?!"  
  
At that moment, Zilberk created a net-like wall from the ground. The
Nyoi was blocked by this wall and retreated to the position of the other
Nyoi. Aoi didn't miss that moment.  
  
"Ha!"  
  
With a shout, she unleashed gravity magic at the spot where the two
overlapped. The Nyoi's movements slowed.  
  
"Mao!!"  
"Leave it to me!"  
  
Mao clad herself in wind and dashed forward with speed matching the
Nyoi, wielding her wind magic sword. The Nyoi's head fell off. Zilberk
had caught the other one by tightening the net. Hisui approached and
unleashed a flash of Yagiri. The Nyoi's body was split in two.  
  
"Whew. Luca! Are there any others?"  
"No, it's okay. There are no more in this tower."  
"Commander, I'll heal you."  
  
Hearing Force's words, Aoi realized that blood was dripping from her
shoulder.  
  
"Ah, please."  
  
Aoi turned to Zilberk and asked.  
  
"Zilberk, did you know about the Nyoi?"  
  
"The Nyoi were in my homeland's forest. Many of my brethren were killed
by them. They hate nets."  
"So that's why they were intimidated by Zilberk's magic."  
"However, these individuals were far stronger than the Nyoi in my
homeland."  
"Perhaps, Luke has strengthened the seal's defenses after all…"  
  
Aoi muttered to herself as she walked towards the sealing monument. She
poured dark magicules into it. The engravings disappeared one by one,
and finally, the magic stone embedded in the monument shattered.  
  
"Whew. Let's get out of here. I don't want to see any more bugs…"  
  
—  
  
"Everyone! Welcome back!"  
  
When they returned to their base village, Marsim greeted them with a
beaming smile.  
  
"Are you injured?"  
"Well, Aoi got her shoulder cut, but Force…Marsim?"  
  
Marsim rushed to Aoi's side and began examining her shoulder.  
  
"It's true. Your clothes are torn!! Miss Aoi, please come here for a
moment!"  
  
Marsim grabbed Aoi's hand and dragged her to the village inn.  
  
"Hey, hey, Marsim. I'm okay."  
"No, you're not. Miss Hisui taught me not to trust Miss Aoi's *'I'm
okay'*  and *'It's easy'* ."  
  
Aoi smiled wryly and let Marsim have her way. Entering the room, Marsim
began to undress Aoi.  
  
"Hey, Marsim. I'll take it off myself. Look, here. There's no scar
anymore, right?"  
"Yeah, that's good… But for Miss Aoi to get hurt…"  
  
Just then, Hisui came in, worried.  
  
"Aoi, are you alrigh…w-w-what are you doing!!"  
"Well, Marsim said she'd check for injuries…"  
  
Hisui looked at Aoi with a stern gaze,  
  
"You seem happy to be worried about…"  
  
Leaving those words behind, she left the room.  
  
"Marsim!…Wh-what should I do? Hisui looked angry…"  
  
Marsim couldn't help but laugh at the sight of the person who wouldn't
be fazed even by an ancient dragon panicking.  
  
"It's not something to laugh about…"  
"It's okay. Miss Hisui is the type to worry that Miss Aoi might be
upset. I'm sure she's waiting for Miss Aoi outside."  
  
When Aoi came out of the inn, Hisui was indeed waiting alone in front of
the door, just as Marsim had said.  
  
"Ah, Aoi. I'm sorry about earlier. I was worried about you, but Marsim
beat me to it… no, that's not it, um, I didn't like that Aoi seemed
happy, or, well…"  
  
Aoi ruffled Hisui's hair as she started making strange excuses.  
  
"Let's all have a big drink tonight! There are still seals left, but
everyone came back safely! Today should be okay, right!"  
"Aoi says that and drinks all the time."  
"Hehehe, it's fine, it's fine! Come on. Let's go, Hisui."  
  
Hisui followed Aoi with a wry smile.
