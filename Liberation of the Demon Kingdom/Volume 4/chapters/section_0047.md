# Chapter 132: Aoi's Life

"Aoi? Are you awake?"  
"Ah, Hisui?"  
"I'm glad... I'm so glad, Aoi..."  
  
Hisui gently hugged Aoi. Tears streamed down her cheeks.  
  
"Ah, Miss Amano healed me... Tsukumi came too?"  
"Yes, Miss Aoi."  
  
Aoi took a deep breath and turned to face Tsukumi.  
  
"If Tsukumi came, it means the Order of Chaos is on the move."  
"Yes. It concerns Miss Aoi as well. May I tell you about it?"  
  
Hisui glared at Tsukumi, but Aoi stopped her from saying anything.  
  
"The Intelligence Division, in conjunction with the Demon Kingdom, made
an internal decision. The Order has begun to move. An army of
approximately 5,000. They were preparing their forces under the guise of
the Demon Kingdom of Bizes territory. However, the numbers alone are not
a big deal. The Demon Kingdom's army can adequately counter them."  
"There are magic beasts, right?"  
"Yes. And they're quite troublesome. Many are individuals with enhanced
bodies... they're hard to kill."  
"Yeah, I saw an ogre in Barlmin territory. It had an unpleasant aura."  
"In addition, they are armed with cursed swords. It is quite a dangerous
force."  
  
Aoi nodded.  
  
"Also, the Demon Kingdom has not been liberated. The seal lives on
within Miss Aoi."  
"Yes. I know that too. It seems to be assimilating with my life."  
  
Hisui's hair stood on end, and her eyes widened.  
  
"Aoi! What does that mean? Assimilating with your life? It can be
separated, right! Right, Aoi!!"  
  
Aoi shook her head slightly.  
  
"It seems to be completely merged. I think the only way to dispel it is
for me to die..."  
"Why? That's not right! That's a lie, right! Aoi! Say something! Say
*'It's okay'*  or *'It's easy'*  like you always do..."  
  
Hisui dropped to the floor and quietly sobbed.  
  
"Hisui."  
  
Aoi got out of bed, went to Hisui's side, and gently hugged her.  
  
"The old me wouldn't have cared about my life if it meant breaking the
curse. But it's different now. I have Hisui. I have comrades who will
help me. I can't die easily. Hisui, I have a favor to ask. Can you lend
me your strength?"  
  
Hisui slowly hugged Aoi back.  
  
"Of course. Aoi."  
"Yeah. Dustis. Can you call Susano? I want to teach Hisui and Susano how
to destroy the underground engraving circle."  
  
"I want you to consider this as one of many options. If I die, the seal
on the Demon Kingdom will be released. If that happens, this engraving
circle will be released. This is a very dangerous thing. So, if I die
and the engraving circle is released, I want Hisui or Susano to quickly
destroy it. The destruction method is..."  
  
Hisui and Susano listened to Aoi's story with complex feelings.  
  
"Aoi. Is there... nothing that can be done?"  
  
Aoi shook her head weakly.  
  
"I don't know. There might be a way. I intend to fight to the very
end."  
  
Hisui and Susano both nodded at Aoi's response.  
  
"Aoi, I’m with you. Let's fight together."  
  
\*Knock knock knock\*  
  
"Hisui, can I have a moment?"  
  
The door opened, and Mao peeked in.  
  
"Miss Aoi!! Miss Aoi! You're awake!!"  
  
Mao rushed into the room and jumped on Aoi.  
  
"Miss Aoi! I was so worried!"  
"Yeah. Mao, thank you for everything."  
  
That was enough for Mao.  
  
"Yeah. Right. It's better to have Miss Aoi hear about it too. Morse is
calling for you."  
  
—  
  
With Hisui supporting Aoi, they descended to the underground engraving
circle.  
  
"Morse. What's wrong?"  
"Ah, Lady Aoi. You've regained consciousness..."  
"It turned out as Morse predicted."  
"Yes, this was also foreseen by Lord Luke... but I cannot fathom Lord
Luke's true intentions..."  
"I see... Anyway, what happened?"  
"Yes, someone is trying to transfer to this engraving circle.
However..."  
  
Aoi glanced at Morse and urged him to continue.  
  
"It is a very weak power. I can easily resist it with my own
strength..."  
  
Hisui had a hunch.  
  
"My rail cannon... Maybe Vegas suffered significant damage."  
"Yes, that must be it. I don't know what a rail cannon is, but it's
certain that the spatial magic user is not in a normal state."  
  
Aoi nodded and turned to Hisui.  
  
"Hisui, I think it's okay to leave this to Morse."  
  
Hisui nodded firmly.  
  
"Yes, I think so too. The corruption poison is broken, so it shouldn't
be a major obstacle."  
"Huh? You broke corruption  poison?"  
"Yes, it's broken off at the base."  
"This’ll be a big advantage for us."  
"Morse, I'm leaving the defense here to you. I'm counting on you."  
"Yes, leave it to me."  
  
At that moment, Shurak rushed in looking flustered.  
  
"Miss Aoi, the Order of Chaos' army of 5,000 has captured Bizes
territory and begun their advance."
