# Chapter 129: The 7th Seal

The 7th Seal. It's about 5 days away from the Demon  City. Aoi, Hisui,
and the seven members of α Squad were tasked with dispelling the 7th
seal. On the day of departure, Aoi saw Mao's figure for the first time
in a while.  
  
"Mao, I haven't seen you lately. What have you been up to?"  
"Hehe. Miss Aoi. I've been doing special training with Morse in spatial
transfer magic."  
  
Mao puffed out her chest and answered confidently.  
  
"Oh, that's amazing. Can you do spatial transfer now?"  
"No, I can't."  
"Eh? Then why do you look so proud?"  
"I'll show you something special, Miss Aoi."  
  
Mao imbued the wind magic sword in her right hand and magicules in her
left.  
  
"Here I go!"  
  
Mao tore through space with her left hand, creating gaps to multiple
spaces, and slashed with her magic sword in her right hand.  
  
"Whoa! Mao, that's amazing."  
  
Three trees about 15 meters ahead were cut at the trunk and fell
simultaneously.  
  
"Hehe. With this, I can slash at multiple enemies at a distance."  
  
Mao had become able to create multiple "gaps" in space with her left
hand. These multiple gaps could each have their exits in different
locations.  
  
"Mao, that means you can simultaneously strike down multiple enemies
within a 15-meter radius, right?"  
"Exactly!"  
  
Mao said while twitching her long, pointed ears.  
  
"But Mao. I think that's quite an advanced magical technique, so if you
can do that, can't you also do spatial transfer magic?"  
  
Mao looked startled and then muttered in a small voice.  
  
"Once I was able to open a lot of gaps, I lost my sense of it and
couldn't open a big hole anymore..."  
"Hehehe, that's so like muscle-brain Mao."  
"Aww, Miss Aoi. Don't say that!!"  
  
Hisui pulled Mao, who had started clinging to Aoi, away.  
  
"Mao, don't stick to Aoi! Get away!"  
"It's okay. Let me cling to her sometimes."  
"No!"  
  
Aoi sighed softly as she watched the two of them flirting.  
  
—  
  
Seven days after departure, Aoi and the others were in front of the 7th
seal. The tower where the 7th seal was located was on the shore of a
peaceful lake.  
  
"It's a very beautiful place. But I feel the worst aura here yet..."  
  
Aoi nodded at Hisui's words.  
  
"As I explained in the Demon City, this tower only has the stone
monument of the seal. I think it will take some time to dispel the curse
and..."  
  
Aoi looked around at everyone here.  
  
"This is the last seal. Interference from the Order of Chaos is also
possible. Therefore, I want Hisui and Luca to help with the dispelling,
and the others to be on alert around the area under Mao's command."  
  
Mao became nervous at Aoi's unusually serious expression.  
  
"Leave it to us, Miss Aoi. More importantly, is there any danger in
dispelling the curse?"  
"Yeah. I think it'll be alright..."  
  
Mao had a worried look on her face, but she answered energetically as if
she had changed his mind.  
  
"We'll protect the surroundings. Miss Aoi, concentrate on lifting the
curse."  
"Thank you, Mao. Okay, then, Hisui, Luca. Let's go."  
  
Aoi, Hisui, and Luca entered the tower of the 7th seal.  
  
"There's really nothing here."  
  
Luca muttered in a disappointed tone while using spatial perception
magic.  
  
"No, wait. Miss Aoi, the entire tower is surrounded by someone. I don't
sense anyone with that much power, but..."  
"It must be the Order of Chaos guys. I think Mao and the others will
take care of it. More importantly, there are guys in the Order of Chaos
who can use spatial transfer magic. Be very careful."  
  
Luca straightened her posture at Aoi's unusually cautious manner.  
  
"Hisui, I'll borrow the Dragon Armament."  
"Yes, here you go."  
  
Hisui handed Aoi the activation key of the Dragon Armament. Aoi
channeled magicules into the activation key and equipped the Dragon
Armament. Furthermore, she clad herself in dark magicules. Hisui
shivered at Aoi's appearance.  
  
(It's no wonder Aoi broke the Dragon Armament. What power...)  
  
Aoi imbued the Dragon Armament with magicules and created an invisible
barrier.  
  
"Okay, I'm going to dispel the seal."  
  
Aoi imbued the stone monument with dark magicules. One engraving after
another disappeared. And finally, the magic stone cracked. At that
moment, Aoi put the maximum magicules into the Dragon Armament and
resisted.  
  
"Ugh, heh heh."  
  
At the same time as Aoi deployed her resist, a very powerful engraving
magic was activated centering on the stone monument. That engraving
concentrated a huge amount of magicules on Aoi and tried to engrave a
"curse" on her body. However, the magicules emitted by the engraving
were blocked by the Dragon Armament and did not reach Aoi.  
  
"Miss Hisui! It's coming!!"  
  
Suddenly, the space in front of the stone monument split open. Powerful
magic was about to be emitted from the rift in space. Without
hesitation, Hisui fired her rail cannon at maximum power into the rift
in space.  
  
"Miss Hisui! More are coming!!"  
  
At the same time as Luca warned, Buenos appeared from the rift in
space.
