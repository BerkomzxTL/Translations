# Chapter 89: Mercenaries

"By the way, Aoi was SSS-Rank in the Asura Kingdom, right? What will you
do in the Demon Kingdom?"  
"What do you mean, *'what will I do'* ? Isn't that something the queen
decides? Hmm. Same as Hisui is fine."  
"It doesn't work that way! SSSSS-Rank is also fine, but..."  
  
Dustis' proposal was immediately rejected by Aoi, and Aoi's knight rank
eventually settled at SSS.  
  
"Alright, let's introduce Aoi's squad. I want to put Aoi in charge of a
mercenary squad. It's technically a Demon Kingdom unit, but... it's a
mixed bag of oddballs. But Aoi can handle it, right?"  
  
Aoi wanted to know the basis for that confidence, but decided not to say
anything.  
The Demon Kingdom has three military forces. Dustis' direct unit, the
Demon Kingdom Knight Corps led by Shurak, and the mercenary squad, which
is an external unit.  
  
"Itâ€™s the group that uses this training ground."  
  
Dustis opened the door leading to the training ground and invited Aoi,
Hisui, and Mao inside.  
Looking at this unit, Aoi understood what Dustis meant.  
There was a wide variety of races. Elves, dark elves, humans, goblins,
ogres, lizardmen, ogrekin, orcs, and so on. They all focused their
attention on the four of them at once. Mao flinched at their gazes.  
  
"Stop what you're doing."  
  
At Dustis' voice, the mercenary squad stopped moving and fell silent.  
  
"I've already spoken to the commander, but we're changing the
composition of the mercenary squad."  
  
The mercenaries were in an uproar at Dustis' words.  
  
"Your Majesty, what does this mean?"  
  
An orc near the door asked Dustis.  
  
"The commander and vice commander will be replaced. The current
commander and vice commander will be transferred to Shurak's Knight
Corps. The new commander will be Aoi, an SSS-Rank knight, and the new
vice commander will be Hisui, an S-Rank knight."  
  
The atmosphere in the room shifted at Dustis' words.  
  
"That little girl is the commander? What's going on?"  
"SSS-Rank? Never heard of it."  
"Are we supposed to follow that big sister's orders?"  
  
Hisui was reminded of when she became a Squad Leader in the Mars
territory.  
  
(I got a similar reaction back then.)  
  
"Silence."  
  
Dustis' words silenced the room.  
  
"It seems some of you have complaints. How about we see Aoi's and
Hisui's skills? If you win, the position of commander and vice commander
will be given to the winners."  
  
Aoi and Hisui looked at each other.  
  
"Uooooh!!"  
  
The training ground was enveloped in an eerie atmosphere at Dustis'
proposal.  
  
"Let me do it!"  
"Uooooh, a woman!! You'll regret this!!"  
"Shut up!! We were here first!!"  
  
Five people stood up, intimidating those around them. The leaders were a
dark elf, a human, and an ogre, with two elves.  
  
"Aoi, what do you want to do? Those five are the figureheads of this
unit."  
  
At Dustis' words, Aoi thought for a moment, then,  
  
"Hisui, how about 2 versus 5?"  
  
She asked Hisui.  
  
"Sounds good. Guys like this remind me of when I was a Squad Leader in
the Mars territory. It's unpleasant."  
"Alright, let's beat them up enough to not kill them."
