# Chapter 109: Aoi's Nude Statue Returns

Dustis immediately gave permission and had a letter delivered to Morse
with Aoi's letter attached, requesting cooperation.  
  
"Hurry, I think he's still at the 5th Seal!"  
  
The messenger sensed the seriousness of the situation from Dustis'
serious expression. He resolved to run desperately for 5 days to reach
the 5th Seal.  
After sending off the messenger, Dustis issued instructions to
strengthen the defense of the Demon City. As a result, the Demon City
took on a wartime appearance. Many soldiers were armed and marching back
and forth.  
  
"We won't be able to allocate as many people to break the seals."  
"About that. Actually, I have the Dragon's Guidance from Aldey.  
Since we'll be passing through the 2nd Seal on our way to the 6th Seal,
how about subduing the Ancient Dragon and using it as a fighting force
when we attack the 3rd and 4th Seals?"  
  
Dustis grasped Aoi's hand firmly.  
  
"That's a wonderful idea!"  
"When do we depart for the 2nd Seal?"  
"Weâ€™re waiting for reinforcements from the Asura Kingdom."  
  
Dustis thought for a moment before answering.  
  
"When will the support from the Asura Kingdom arrive?"  
"We'll meet up at the location. Do you remember Count Mars? That stylish
old man. Or, is he an old grandpa now?"  
"I remember him. His appearance is hard to forget... and he's also
Hisui's former superior."  
"Count Mars is coming. Hmm, about 7 days from now."  
  
Hisui was excited as she listened to the two of them talking.  
  
(Maybe I'll get to see Count Mars and everyone from the Mars Knights? I
want to see Marsim.)  
  
"Dustis. What should we do about the formation?"  
"Well, it's a joint operation with the Asura Kingdom, and I want to see
Count Mars too, so I'm planning to handle it with my knights, 150
strong."  
  
Aoi grinned.  
  
"We'll get to see Dustis' water magic. Hisui, Dustis' magicule control
is amazing."  
"Of course! I've never met anyone with more skillful magicule control
than me."  
  
However, Aoi said to Dustis, who was looking smug.  
  
"Hehe. Dustis. My Hisui is pretty good too, you know? Hisui! Show her
that thing. My statue!"  
  
Hisui made a strange face and hesitated for a moment, but took Aoi's
statue out of the bag on her back and handed it to Dustis.  
  
"Th-this is. Amazing."  
"E-eh. Please let me see it too!"  
"I-it's really amazing. The level of detail is incredible."  
"Whoa, whoa. Hisui. This is a carving of Aoi?"  
  
Mao asked Hisui with a bright red face.  
  
"Of course! I made it while looking at her."  
  
Aoi noticed the unnaturalness of the conversation.  
  
"N-no way!"  
  
What was there was a nude statue of Aoi. And it was even more powerful.
It was even colored.  
  
"Hisui!! No, not this one!!"  
  
Aoi was blushing while writhing in agony.  
  
"And why is there even color? And, and it's exactly like me!  
"Aoi! Miss Hisui is definitely amazing! Maybe even better than Jinrai! I
can't let my guard down."  
  
Dustis turned to face Hisui and said with a serious expression.  
  
"This statue. Can I have it?"  
"Yes! Yes! I want it too."  
  
However, their wishes were immediately rejected by Aoi.
