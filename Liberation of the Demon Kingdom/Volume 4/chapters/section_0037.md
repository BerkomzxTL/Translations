# Chapter 122: The 6th Seal and the Railgun Test Firing

Aoi, Hisui, Marsim, and the α Squad of 8 people set off for the 6th
Seal.  
  
"Commander Aoi, what kind of guardian beast is at the 6th Seal?"  
  
Mikazuchi asked in a casual manner.  
  
"That's the thing, I don't really know."  
"I see."  
  
(No, no, that's itーー!)  
  
Marsim hurriedly asked Aoi a question.  
  
"But isn't there, like, a hint or something?"  
"Hmm. Nope..."  
"M-Miss Hisui."  
"If Aoi says she doesn't know, then she really doesn't know."  
  
Marsim became increasingly anxious, but the morale of the α Squad was
high. That was strange to Marsim. Marsim secretly asked Force.  
  
"Mr. Force, aren't you worried about conquering the 6th Seal?"  
"Not really. We have Miss Hisui, and the Squad Leader too. You saw
yesterday's bombardment, right? There's no reason to be worried. On the
contrary, I feel sorry for the guardian beast of the 6th Seal.
Besides."  
"Besides?"  
"Miss Aoi is here."  
  
Marsim understood with those words. How trusted Aoi is! How reliable
Hisui and Mao are! Marsim felt proud.  
  
"My choice to become Miss Aoi's maid was not wrong! Fufufu. But I'll be
strict with my care!"  
  
—  
  
4 days later, Aoi and the others arrived at the nearest village to the
6th Seal. They showed the letter from Dustis to the village chief and
had him secure lodging for them as a base. That day, the village chief
held a modest encouragement party for them.  
  
"We'll attack the 6th Seal in 2 days. Marsim, you'll stay here as a base
for rear support."  
  
Marsim was well aware of her abilities and obediently followed.  
  
"Yes, Miss Aoi."  
"And, you know. I think it will be a legitimate dungeon capture.
Considering the structure of the tower, we should expect it to take
about 3 days. I'm sorry, Marsim. Could you prepare food, water, and
supplies?"  
"Leave it to me!"  
"Everyone else, take a vacation! Rest well. Also... Village chief. I
have a request..."  
  
The next day. Aoi and Hisui were excited. They had obtained permission
from the village chief to test-fire the rail cannon. The members other
than Aoi and Hisui,  
  
(The village chief definitely doesn't understand the gravity of the
situation...)  
  
But the desire to know the power of the new weapon before attacking the
6th Seal won out, so everyone remained silent.  
  
"Everyone, is it okay even though you're on vacation?"  
  
Aoi said apologetically to the α Squad members who were following along
to the test firing.  
  
"No, it looks fun to see what will happen."  
  
Mikazuchi replied, and everyone nodded.  
  
"Then everyone. Let's meet your expectations!"  
  
Hisui said that and donned the Dragon Armament.  
  
(W, what is thatーー.)  
  
Marsim was greatly surprised. She asked Mao, who was nearby.  
  
"W, what is that??"  
"Ah. That's the Dragon Armament."  
"Eh! The Dragon Armament that the *'Nameless Magic Warrior'*  wore?"  
"Miss Aoi broke when she was using it, but Hisui fixed it and is now
using it."  
"E, eh?? Miss Aoi was using it?"  
"Yeah. Because Miss Aoi is the *'Nameless Magic Warrior'* . Ah! It's a
secret..."  
  
(N, n. The Nameless Magic Warrior!! Miss Aoi!! One of the Six Heroes!!
The lords cooperated greatly with the Six Heroes. Count Mars' attitude
towards Miss Aoi makes senseーーー!)  
  
"Well then, here I go!"  
  
Hisui pointed the rail cannon at a small hill.  
  
"I'll load a heat-resistant bullet. If I don't give it heat resistance,
the bullet will burn up. Then, I'll convert the magicules into lightning
charge. I've given it about 3 times the explosive power of a railgun.
The fired bullet is accelerated by a five-layered light engraving. At
this time, the bullet rotates due to the spiral grooves engraved in the
gun barrel, and flies straight to the target!"  
  
Everyone was overwhelmed by Hisui speaking rapidly.  
  
"Fire!!"  
  
The bullet was fired with a crackling sound. With tremendous impact! The
bullet pierced the air and landed on the small hill about 1 km away. A
tremendous flash, then a blast, and then a shock wave!  
  
"Oooooh!"  
  
Everyone was surprised by the impact, which was 3 times greater than the
railgun test firing. A large crater had been created in the small
hill.  
  
"Mufufu. With this, the 6th Seal and the 7th Seal aren’t scary!"  
  
What was pitiful was the village chief, who was desperately trying to
calm the villagers who started shouting "We have incurred the wrath of
God!"
