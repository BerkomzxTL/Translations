# Chapter 96: Is Aoi a Monster?

In the afternoon, organizational combat training was conducted for the
mercenary corps to confirm the cooperation of each squad.  
  
"Bardock, I'll leave the overall training of the mercenary corps to you
from now on."  
  
Basically, mercenaries belong to the corps through individual contracts.
Since the salary depends on individual ability, mercenaries who neglect
basic training are weeded out.  
However, they are not good at coordinated combat. Aoi was thinking of
having β Squad take overall control and play a central role in battles.
Therefore, she was going to entrust Bardock with organizational combat
training.  
On the other hand, she was thinking of having α Squad handle special
missions. For example, conquering dungeons.  
  
"Aoi, are you going to explore the 6th and 7th seals with α Squad?"  
  
Aoi answered Hisui's question with a smile.  
  
"Yes. I'm going to have α Squad help with dungeon exploration. Of
course, including you, Hisui."  
  
Hisui happily took Aoi's arm and entwined it with her own.  
  
"Hehehe, leave it to me!"  
  
Aoi stroked Hisui's head and muttered in a small voice.  
  
"Thank you..., Hisui."  
"Huh? What is it?"  
"No, it's nothing. But before dungeon exploration, the dispelling of the
1st seal comes first. I have to plan with Dustis."  
  
Aoi was initially planning to have Shurak or Susano dispel the seals
from the 1st to the 5th as planned.  
  
"I don't know how the Order will move, so I'll form a knight order and
attack."  
"Attack...? What's in the seals?"  
"Ah, each has a guardian beast created by Luke with dark magic. They're
scaryーー."  
"Huh? Isn't dispelling supposed to be easy?"  
"Dispelling is easy if you can use dark magic."  
"The guardian beasts are,  
  
 1st Golem (large army)  
 2nd Ancient Dragon  
 3rd Fenrir  
 4th Gargoyle (large army)  
 5th Lich  
  
 that's all."  
  
Hisui was surprised and stunned. No way, it's not easy at all!  
  
"Aoi, where is it easy? Those are all incredibly difficult
opponents..."  
"No, no, that's not true. Hisui's golem is overwhelmingly stronger than
the golems and gargoyles, and a group battle by the knight order is
effective against them, right? There were two dragons, but I defeated
one of them... and I beat the Lich and made it obey me, so I guess
Fenrir is the only one that's hard to deal with?"  
  
Hisui was stunned. What is this person?  
  
"... ."  
"What?"  
"Monster! Aoi is a monster?!"  
"W-what are you saying?"  
  
Aoi said with a pout.  
  
"I heard about the story of you defeating the Magic Dragon. But there's
another one! Did you take on two dragons?"  
"That's right..."  
"And you even subjugated a Lich! How did you make an opponent like a
lump of formless magicules obey you?"  
"How? I just dropped half of its body into subspace with dark magic like
normal..."  
"Monster! You're definitely a monster, Aoi!! What do you mean,
*‘Normal’* ! It's not normal at all! I'm getting a headache."  
"Should I heal you?"  
"That's not what I mean!!!"  
  
—  
  
"... That's how it is. Miss Dustis, please say something to Aoi..."  
  
Hisui had a tired look on her face. Dustis looked at such Hisui with a
curious expression.  
  
"Huh? Aoi is a monster? What are you talking about now?"  
"... ."  
"I know that defeating the guardian beasts isn't easy. But it's not
impossible! It's reassuring to have you guys, but I want you to
concentrate on the 6th and 7th seals."  
"Ah, but I'm going to the 1st seal with you. I'm thinking of attacking
with two squads, the knight order and the mercenary corps."  
  
Dustis nodded deeply and gave instructions to Shurak.  
  
"Shurak, work out the details with Aoi. Aoi, Shurak. How soon can you
prepare?"  
"Let's see. A week? How about you, Shurak?"  
"It’s possible."  
"I understand. Then let's leave in 10 days."  
"Dustis, Shurak. I have a favor to ask."  
  
Aoi started hesitantly.  
  
"I want you to entrust Susano to me. I will definitely protect her. I
want her to learn how to use dark magic near me."  
  
Dustis and Shurak looked at each other but both nodded immediately.  
  
"I understand. We'll entrust Susano to Aoi. Thank you."  
"Yes, same here."  
"By the way..."  
  
Hisui also looked around at everyone hesitantly.  
  
"What are the 6th and 7th seals like?"  
"Ah, I don't know."  
"Eh?"  
"I don't know. There's a pretty dangerous aura, and I've never been
inside myself."  
  
Hisui was shocked.  
  
(Even Aoi says it's *'dangerous'* ? How dangerous is it...?)  
  
Seeing Hisui, who had fallen silent, Dustis stepped in to follow up.  
  
"No, but if Aoi and Miss Hisui are there, it'll be alright. You also
have the Dragon Armament."  
"Yes..."  
  
Hisui was uneasy but had no choice but to answer yes.
