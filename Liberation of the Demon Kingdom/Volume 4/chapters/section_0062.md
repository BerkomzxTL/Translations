# Chapter 147: The Wind Brigade (1)

After Story 1  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Miss Aoi, please! I'm begging you."  
"No way. You should handle it yourself."  
  
Three years have passed since the seal of the Demon Kingdom was broken.
During that time, Aoi and Hisui had been running around the Demon
Kingdom. Even though the seal was lifted, the land was still unstable.
There were bandits and gangs running rampant, and corruption in the
local administrations was common.  
Aoi and Hisui, along with Sheema, had spent three years building the
framework of the Demon Kingdom.  
  
"It's like we're retired old folks on a journey to set things
right..."  
  
Hisui likened themselves to the old man who, after retiring as the Prime
Minister of the Asura Kingdom, went on a journey to reform the world.  
That kind of life was finally coming to an end. Thanks to Aoi and
Hisui's efforts, the reign of Queen Susano was becoming stable.  
However, this city, the capital of the Demon Kingdom, was rapidly
developing, and the underworld was starting to form, which was a
headache for the Demon Kingdom.  
To address this problem, Prime Minister Sheema made a proposal to Mao,
the captain of the mercenary corps.  
  
"Can't we team up with a civilian mercenary group?"  
"Eh? Sheema, what do you mean?"  
"We can't openly control the underworld in the Demon Kingdom, right? We
team up with a civilian mercenary group and have that mercenary group
manage the underworld.  
But in reality, I wonder if we can create a system where the Demon
Kingdom is the one keeping the underworld in check...?"  
"Sheema! That's good! I see... Sheema, you're a strategist! I'm
impressed."  
"Then, Miss Mao, I'm counting on you. You can use some money, too."  
"Eh? Eh? I'm not good at that kind of thing..."  
"I think it would be good to have Luca investigate the civilian
mercenary groups and find a good candidate."  
  
A few days later, a report came from the Intelligence Division, but Mao
gave up on reading it early and came to Aoi and Hisui's house.  
  
"That's the situation! Miss Aoi! Hisui says that the mercenary group
called *'Wind Brigade'*  is the best fit... Let's go talk to them!"  
"Ugh, I don’t want to..."  
"I'm not good with rough guys... I feel like my chastity is in danger...
Because, you know, the leader of the Wind Brigade is called *'Goddamn'*
! He's definitely a jerk!!"  
  
Mao pleaded with Hisui with teary eyes. Hisui gave Mao a wry smile.  
  
"Aoi..., what do you think...? Mao's desperate, so why don't you help
her this time..."  
  
“Hmm,” Aoi groaned, but she eventually relented.  
  
"Alright... Mao, I'll go with you to the Wind Brigade. Arrange the
schedule..."  
"Yes! I understand. Thank you, Miss Aoi! And Hisui too! I'll talk to
Marsim about the schedule."  
  
Mao stood up with a hop, looking relieved.  
  
"But Mao is still as muscle-brained as ever..."  
"Aah, Miss Aoi! Don't say that!!"  
  
Hisui pulled Mao away from Aoi, who was clinging to her.  
  
"Seriously! Mao, don't stick to Aoi!"  
"It's fine! Just this once..."  
"Mao, it's the same as always! Ge-e-et away!"  
  
Aoi watched Hisui and Mao, who had started to flirt, with an exasperated
expression.  
  
◇  
  
As the dense magicules that had been present started to thin, many
people gathered in the Demon Capital. It still didn't compare to the
capital of the Asura Kingdom, but vegetables cultivated in the vicinity
of the Demon Capital and trade goods from the Asura Kingdom were
displayed in the shops, and the place was bustling with life.  
However, as is often the case, where there is light, there is darkness.
While the Demon City was showing off its splendor, criminal
organizations that engaged in illegal drugs and human trafficking were
rampant. Of course, Queen Susano would not allow it, and she was
strengthening the crackdown, but it was a game of cat and mouse.  
That's where Prime Minister Sheema's plan was considered. To have a
civilian mercenary group control the underworld of the Demon Capital,
and to also suppress the Demon Capital from behind the scenes.  
  
"But, Sheema thinks up some amazing things, doesn't she? Though I don't
know if it's appropriate to choose Mao as the person in charge..."  
"That's true. I think someone like Bardock would be more suitable..."  
"You can't make the Commander of the Knights do such a thing, can
you?"  
"That's also true..."  
  
That day, Aoi and Hisui had come to the tavern where they were meeting
Mao. The bar had recently become quite popular.  
  
"Hisui, the Wind Brigade is a mercenary group that started in the Asura
Kingdom, right?"  
"Yes, the leader is Goddamn. He's a wind user. I think they're a
well-organized mercenary group. They mainly take on the task of
subjugating bandits and guarding merchants. They've had a branch in the
Demon Kingdom since the trade between the Asura Kingdom and the Demon
Kingdom became prosperous. About a year ago."  
"Hmm, and? Why is this mercenary group good?"  
"Luca is also recommending the Wind Brigade... The reasons are that they
are well-controlled, they are strong, and they also have connections
with the underworld in the Asura Kingdom. In short, it's an organization
that embraces both the good and the bad, and they are running it
properly."  
"I see."  
  
Yuri finished drinking his ale and sighed.  
  
"I wonder if the leader is a capable person..."  
  
"Hehe, sisters. Why don't you drink with us?"  
  
Suddenly, three boorish men called out. Hisui glared at the men.  
  
"Oh, you have such a lovely look in your eyes. We'll take care of
you."  
  
Aoi sighed and turned to the men.  
  
"Oh, brothers. You shouldn't bother us. You'll get hurt."  
"Hehe, how could you hurt me?"  
  
The man said that and reached out to grope Aoi's chest.  
  
"Do you want to die?"  
  
Hisui held down his hand and said.  
  
"Oh, scary. This one's small, but I don’t mind being with a big
sister."  
  
The man reached for Hisui's chest, too.  
  
"Huh? Huh?"  
  
When he realized it, a lump of iron was clinging to his hand.  
  
"W-what is this? Ugh!!"  
  
The man was punched hard by Hisui and blown away. He collapsed, breaking
the next table, and didn’t move.  
  
"You, you! You've done something terrible!"  
  
The remaining men drew their knives and approached Hisui.  
  
"I guess it can't be helped..."  
  
Aoi quickly thrust her fists into the men's stomachs.  
  
"Ugh..."  
  
The men retched and crumpled to the ground.  
  
"It's good you weren't killed by Hisui."  
"Aoi! That guy tried to grope Aoi's chest! He should die! And he said my
chest is s-small!!"  
"Hisui is as extreme as ever. And even though her breasts are smaller
than mine, they're still beautiful."  
  
Aoi winked at Hisui.  
  
"Hey, you! What's going on here!"  
  
Suddenly, Aoi and Hisui saw a group of five armed men with swords at
their waists coming toward them.  
  
"Aoi, it's the Wind Brigade."  
  
Seeing the matching uniforms, Hisui told Aoi.  
  
"Oh dear, Hisui. Let's be on our best behavior here..."
