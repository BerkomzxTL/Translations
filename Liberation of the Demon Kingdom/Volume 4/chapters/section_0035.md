# Chapter 120: What Is a Railgun?

That night, thanks to Dustis and Mars' arrangement, Aoi and Hisui were
given their own room.  
  
"When I was asked by Hisui to engrave the railgun, I didn't think it
would become such an amazing weapon."  
  
"Heh heh heh. Actually, that's a prototype."  
  
Aoi became instantly worried by Hisui's smug face.  
  
"W-what do you mean?"  
"Tada!"  
  
Hisui activated her Dragon Armament and proudly showed Aoi the
cylindrical weapon attached to her left hand.  
  
"It's a rail cannon! It's not engraved yet though..."  
  
It was a cylindrical shape about 1.3 meters long, with a larger caliber
than the railgun.  
  
"I've strengthened the engraving that converts magicules into lightning.
Also, I've layered the engraving that repels light five times. And the
biggest change is, look at this!"  
  
Hisui let Aoi peek into the barrel.  
  
"I cut a spiral into the inside of the barrel. This will make the bullet
spin, so it will fly straight and far!"  
"O-oh, I see..."  
"I'll adjust it so that it's ready in time for breaking the seal, so
please engrave it."  
  
Hisui bowed her head.  
  
"Hisui's magicule control is amazing. I can't believe you can do
something so precise..."  
"This might be the only thing I can beat Aoi at."  
"Hey, hey, my magicule control is amazing too, you know?"  
"But Aoi basically just throws around a huge amount of magicules,
right?"  
  
Aoi puffed out her cheeks.  
  
"That's not true. I can do delicate things too, you know."  
"Then, show me."  
  
Aoi thought for a while, then grinned and looked at Hisui.  
  
"Speaking of which, you did me all night in the Great Forest, didn't
you?"  
  
Hisui's face turned red in an instant, and her eyes began to dart
around.  
  
"T-that's because Aoi said it felt good..."  
  
Aoi gathered magicules and enveloped the entire room in dark
magicules.  
  
"I was embarrassed because everyone could hear my voice back then. This
should be okay!"  
"A-Aoi?"  
"You can shout as loud as you want, okay?"  
  
Aoi quickly stripped off Hisui's nightgown and underwear. Then, she
gathered dark magicules and created a slime-like "shape" that wriggled
in her right hand.  
  
"I'll show you my delicate magicule control!!"  
"N-noooooo!"  
  
That night, Hisui was tormented by Aoi all night long and was left
breathless.  
  
â€”  
  
The next morning was filled with refreshing air. The humid air brought a
cold wind, covering the volcanic area.  
When Aoi woke up, she stretched greatly. The effect of the
already-lifted seals was dramatic, and Aoi felt truly refreshed.  
  
"Hisui! Wake up. It's such a beautiful morning!"  
  
Hisui couldn't get up and glared at Aoi from the bed.  
  
"Aoi... please take responsibility. I can't get up anymore..."  
"What are you saying? We're leaving for the 6th Seal today."  
"U-ugh. I can't go..."  
  
Aoi forcibly woke Hisui, who was clinging to the bed, and helped her put
on her clothes.  
  
"Come on, pull yourself together."  
"U-ugh. I can't. Please carry me on your back..."  
"Geez. Hisui is so helpless. I'll engrave the rail cannon you showed me
yesterday, so wake up."  
  
Hisui perked up and started preparing herself busily.  
  
"Aoi, can we have breakfast first?"  
  
Aoi watched Hisui with an astonished look.
