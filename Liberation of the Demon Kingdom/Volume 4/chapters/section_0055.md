# Chapter 140: Light and Darkness

"Aoi."  
  
Aoi woke up to a voice calling her name.  
  
"Where is this?"  
  
When Aoi woke up, she found herself in an empty white world.  
  
"Aoi. My lovely daughter..."  
  
Aoi was drawn weakly towards the voice.  
  
"You are..."  
  
There stood a woman with the same face as Aoi.  
  
"Aoi, my lovely daughter with Luke. I can finally talk to you."  
"Miss Mirei?"  
"Yes. I am Mirei."  
"Miss Mirei, please send me back to Hisui. A wicked demon has appeared.
I have to go."  
"That is an ancient, cursed biological weapon. You can't defeat it in
your current state."  
"I know. But..."  
"Hey, do you know that dark magic can manipulate time?"  
  
Aoi was skeptical but answered "I know."  
  
"Luke saw the future. He dreamed of that demon destroying the world in
the distant future..."  
"What do you mean?"  
"Dullahan was plotting to obtain dark magicules and merge with this
biological weapon. A large amount of dark magicules was needed to
unleash the demon into the world. That's why Dullahan set up the
engraving circle."  
"But Dullahan is dead!"  
"Yes, but the demon is still there. And Luke saw the future with the
power of dark magicules. A desperate future."  
  
Aoi listened to Mirei's story in a daze.  
  
"But you know, Luke also saw a past that gave him hope. A technique to
defeat the demon."  
"What does that mean?"  
"To defeat the demon, a fusion of light and darkness is necessary. A
fusion of souls is also needed."  
"A fusion of souls..."  
"That's right. Luke decided to use the engraving circle. To bestow
powers on those who are qualified, strong, and righteous."  
"Luke sealed the engraving circle with seven seals to prevent it from
being misused and to prevent the demon from moving.  
The seal in the Sugal Plains was a new seal to weaken the demon's power.
But the demon will inevitably revive.  
That's why Luke secretly hid a technique to engrave darkness on the soul
in the 7th Seal, and in the sealing circle the formula to engrave light
on the soul. Hoping that you would break the seal, defeat the demon, and
save the world."  
"Wasn't Luke… a demon who wished for chaos and no order in the world?"  
  
Mirei shook her head with a gentle expression.  
  
"Luke's methods may have been extreme. He continued to sow the seeds of
war in the world in order to hinder the development of magic...  
But that was to prevent the developed magic from breaking the demon's
seal. He is a kind person. Luke is."  
  
Aoi lowered her eyes.  
  
"Then, what was the point of us defeating Luke?"  
"Because Luke wanted it. Because those who could be entrusted with the
future appeared. Luke was tired. He wanted to be freed from his mission
by entrusting the future to you. I will finally be freed from my mission
too. I’ll be able to see Luke again."  
  
Tears streamed down Aoi's face.  
  
"Aoi, I am the key to engraving the curse of light on your soul."  
  
After Mirei's words, Aoi felt a power being engraved on her soul. Within
Aoi's soul, the curses of light and darkness became one.  
  
"Aoi, Hisui is a part of your soul. The soul that spilled from you when
you were born is Hisui. Hisui's role is to unite your swords. I believe
she can do it."  
  
—  
  
"Mao!"  
  
Mao dodged Buenos' explosion magic and tried to cut the Demon God with
her wind magic sword. However, the Demon God was unaffected by the magic
sword's slash.  
  
"Damn it."  
  
Mao then created a fissure in space and swung her magic sword at Buenos.
A fissure ran through the space 8m from Mao, and Mao's magic sword
flashed.  
It was a very sharp attack, but Buenos blocked it with Magicule Eater.
Mao's magicules were eaten by Magicule Eater, and Mao felt a slight
dizziness.  
  
"Mao! Get away!"  
  
Hisui fired her rail cannon at Buenos with maximum output. Hisui's
full-force blow was deflected by Buenos' Magicule Eater, but the
deflected bullet hit the Demon God behind him.  
  
"How's that?"  
  
A tremendous explosion occurred, but...  
  
"Damn!"  
  
The Demon God was unharmed. The Demon God opened its hideous mouth
toward Hisui.  
  
"Dooorrr!!!"  
  
Dark magicules poured out of the demon's mouth in a torrent toward
Hisui. Hisui resisted with the power of the Dragon Armament, but all the
invisible walls were easily broken. The chest armor of the Dragon
Armament exploded.  
  
"Hisui!"  
"Mao, do we have any offensive options?"  
"Hehehe, no..."  
"I knew it. Hehehe, me too. But I want to avenge Buenos! For Aoi!"  
"Alright, Hisui! Let's kill him!"  
"Mao... you're being violent."  
"Fuhahaha! The Demon God is invincible. We should have done this from
the start! I'll take the engraving circle!"  
  
Hisui and Mao ran towards Buenos. Mao opened a fissure in space. An exit
opened in front of Bueno. Mao's sharp slash ran through. Bueno threw his
body to the ground to avoid Mao's magic sword. Then Hisui swung down the
Yagiri from above. A spirit-rending shout.  
  
"Damn it!"  
  
Buenos barely avoided Hisui's slash, but his shoulder was cut and fresh
blood splattered.  
  
"Demon God, erase this filthy brat from this world!!"  
  
At Buenos' words, the Demon God moved. It crushed the place where Hisui
and Mao were with its huge hand filled with magicules. A huge explosion
of energy occurred. When the dust settled, the two were gone.  
  
"Not even ashes remain!!"  
  
Buenos' satisfied voice echoed, but  
  
"Fuhehehe, Hisui! I was able to teleport us!"  
  
A carefree voice could be heard from behind the Demon God.  
  
"Mao, great job!"  
  
Hisui caught the Demon God from behind with the rail cannon. The bullet
was fired with a five-layered acceleration engraving. The bullet hit the
back of the Demon God's head, but...  
  
"No good..."  
  
The Demon God only sustained a small wound.  
The Demon God slowly turned around. Hisui and Mao could see the ominous
dark magicules roaring from its mouth.  
  
"I-is this it..."  
  
Hisui was terrified. It was a primal fear.  
  
"Mao, I'm sorry. I got you involved..."  
"Fufu, Hisui. I'm glad I met you..."  
  
The demon's roar echoed around, and a mass of dark magicules attacked
Hisui and Mao.
