# Chapter 87 Queen Dustis

"Aoi!!"  
  
Inside was a tall, gentle-faced dark elf. It was Dustis.  
Dustis rushed to Aoi and hugged her tightly.  
  
"Really...really.... You always make me worry so much..."  
  
His face was a mess of tears.  
  
"I'm back, Dustis. You're still a crybaby."  
"Aoi, you're such an idiot..."  
  
Dustis stroked Aoi's body over and over, as if to make sure she was
safe.  
  
"Have the dark magicules returned yet?"  
  
Dustis knew that Aoi had been in recovery for three years. That if the
dark magicules didn't return, Aoi would be sacrificing her own life
every time she used magic.  
  
"Not completely, but it's mostly back."  
"That's good. Aoi, you always do things that put your life at risk...
Anyway, I'm so happy to see you again, Aoi."  
  
â€”  
  
"Dustis, let me introduce you. My partner, Hisui. Uh, an A-Rank knight
of the Asura Kingdom. And Mao, a member of Anna's Royal Guard. Mao
volunteered to come along to use the elven gate."  
  
Hisui thought it was a rough introduction, but greeted Dustis anyway.  
  
"I am Hisui, an A-Rank knight of the Asura Kingdom's Intelligence
Division. Your Majesty..."  
  
Hisui's formal greeting was interrupted by Aoi.  
  
"Ah, Hisui. Dustis doesn't need that kind of thing."  
"Miss Hisui. Aoi is right. That kind of thing is unnecessary."  
  
Still... Dustis thought. About Aoi calling Hisui her partner.  
  
(Is Hisui skilled enough for Aoi to call her a partner??)  
  
Dustis channeled water magicules with her right hand, transforming it
into an ice spear, and suddenly launched it at Hisui.  
Hisui had anticipated Dustis' actions. Without panic, she deployed
magicules and resisted.  
  
"I see. So that's why Aoi calls you her partner... My apologies, Miss
Hisui. I wanted to test if you were someone who could stand alongside
Aoi."  
  
Aoi, who had been watching the situation, said to Dustis with a smug
look.  
  
"How is she? My Hisui?"  
"Her magicule control is impressive. She might be as skilled as me..."  
"W-well, thank you..."  
Hisui's face turned red at the unexpected praise, and she looked down.  
Mao was,  
  
(Am I going to be tested too??)  
  
She braced himself, but nothing happened, and she was relieved
inwardly.  
  
(I couldn't handle an attack like that...)
