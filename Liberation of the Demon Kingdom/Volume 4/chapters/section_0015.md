# Chapter 100: Giant Golem

Hisui activated the Dragon Armament. Aoi also clad herself in dark
magicules.  
  
"Aoi, what's that?"  
"Ah, I've granted myself body enhancement and magic resistance. Let's
go!"  
  
Aoi flew into the sky using gravity manipulation, with Hisui following
behind.  
The giant golem appeared near the tower. Approximately 20 meters tall.
Sensing Aoi and Hisui's approach, it nimbly closed the distance. Aoi
slid under the golem's feet and unleashed a strike of Nijimaru on its
foot.  
  
"So hard. What is this made of?"  
  
Aoi retreated from the golem's attack range and recharged Nijimaru with
magicules. Hisui, in order to distract the golem from Aoi, went to cut
the golem's head from the front with Yagiri. However, it was repelled by
the golem's resistance.  
  
"Then!"  
  
Hisui conjured a giant rock above the golem's head.  
  
"Take this!"  
  
Hisui dropped the rock onto the golem with a shout. But this attack was
also repelled by the golem's resistance.  
The rock split in two down the middle. Without a moment's hesitation,
the golem turned the shattered rocks into bullets and attacked Hisui.
Countless rock bullets assaulted Hisui.  
Hisui infused the Dragon Armament with magicules and created an
invisible wall. One wall was broken, but the attack did not reach
Hisui.  
  
"Thank you! I’ve gathered some magicules!"  
  
Aoi landed on the ground and returned Nijimaru to its sheath, assuming
an iai stance, and swung her sword. A torrent of light swarmed the
golem.  
  
"!"  
  
The golem resisted this attack by thrusting its hands forward to defend.
Hisui was surprised. To think it could block such an attack. But the
giant golem was already in tatters.  
  
Its right arm had been blown off, and most of the surface armor had
peeled away. However, the golem still advanced on Aoi and Hisui.  
  
"It's still moving?"  
  
Just as Hisui was about to infuse Yagiri with magicules and slash at the
golem, the golem's behavior changed.  
  
"Aoi, the golem is gathering magicules inside!"  
  
Hisui remembered this attack. It was when she fought Mao and the other
high elves in the Great Forest. At that time, Hisui had mini-lem
concentrate magicules in the same way and detonated it. ※  
  
"Aoi! The golem is going to explode!"  
  
Aoi nodded and kneaded dark magicules, concentrating them on the giant
golem. A heavy gravitational field was generated around the golem.  
  
"Crush!"  
  
It was almost simultaneous with the golem's explosion. The fragments of
rock scattered by the golem's explosion were pulled back in by Aoi's
gravity magic. And crushed by supergravity. An entrance to a subspace
opened at the center of the pitch-black magic. The golem was sucked into
it.  
  
"!"  
  
Aoi, confirming that the golem had been sucked into subspace, dispelled
the gravitational field.  
  
"Phew..."  
  
Aoi dispelled the dark magic of body enhancement she had cloaked herself
in and sat down on the spot.  
  
"Are you alright?"  
  
Hisui, surprised by the extremely powerful magic, rushed to Aoi and
confirmed her safety.  
  
"I think both Hisui and I would’ve been okay. But if that golem had
detonated with that amount of magicules, it might have caused a lot of
damage."  
  
Hisui was silent for a while. She stared intently at Aoi, then
muttered,  
  
"I won't believe Aoi's *'It's easy'*  and *'It's okay'*  anymore..."  
  
She muttered.
