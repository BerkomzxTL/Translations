# Chapter 113: Marsim's Thoughts

The dinner that Dustis prepared was modest due to being on an
expedition, but the food was hearty and very satisfying to the Mars
Knights.  
More than anything, thanks to Dustis' consideration, Aoi was the only
outsider, and Hisui was also able to talk with the Mars Knights at ease.
Aoi is happy as long as she has alcohol, and the Mars Knights really
liked Aoi, who is beautiful and friendly.  
The knights approached Aoi with discretion, as a cold murderous aura
would fly their way if they tried to flirt with her.  
  
"So, Miss Aoi, have you known the Count for a long time?"  
"Yeah, that's right. He's still flamboyant even as an old man. Right,
Mars?"  
"I don't think I'm flamboyant, you know. Well, even so, Lady Aoi hasn't
changed. She's still beautiful."  
  
The knights couldn't believe that Aoi was so familiar with Count Mars,
and that Count Mars allowed it.  
  
"Miss Hisui. Who is Miss Aoi?"  
  
Hisui was at a loss for an answer to this question.  
  
"Hmm. In a word, she's a monster. If you want to know more, ask her
yourself."  
"Hisui!! I heard that! Who's a monster!"  
  
Marsim reacted to that word.  
  
"That's right. There's no way someone as lovely as her is a monster."  
"Oh, you understand!!"  
"Just a seemingly beatable SSS-Rank knight."  
  
Hisui became displeased with Marsim's obvious goading. She thought about
saying something to Marsim. Count Mars felt the same way.  
Aoi stopped them both from reflexively getting up with a look.  
  
"That's right, isn't it? Despite being so lovely. You understand. Hisui
is terrible for calling someone a monster."  
"Miss Hisui isn't terrible. Miss Hisui is my partner. Give me back Miss
Hisui."  
  
Aoi was fond of Marsim's straightforwardness.  
  
"Hmm, that's a problem. She's my partner right now. Oh, why don't you
come to our squad for the seal's release tomorrow? We have an elf wind
user, so how about a switch?"  
"I'd like that! I'll show you my power."  
"Squad Leader Mitsui, how about it? A swap with our wind user. She's
quite skilled, so she won't cause you any trouble."  
"I don't mind..."  
"I won't cause any trouble either. Besides, I'm good at coordinating
with Miss Hisui!"  
"Okay, then. I'm counting on you tomorrow."  
  
â€”  
  
"Aoi... I'm sorry..."  
  
After that, Hisui came to apologize with Count Mars to Aoi, who had
started a drinking contest with the knights.  
  
"Why are you apologizing, Hisui...? On the contrary, I liked how Marsim
seems to adore Hisui."  
"No, but. That attitude towards one of the Six Heroes is
unacceptable."  
"No, no, Mars. That's a secret, okay?"  
"Marsim thought of Hisui as a real older sister..."  
  
Hisui nodded in agreement.  
  
"I think of her as a younger sister too..."  
"Well, I think tomorrow will be a good stimulus, Mars. Also, the wind
user who will be visiting Squad Leader Mitsui's place tomorrow is
amazing, so don't be surprised."  
  
Aoi said to Mars with a smirk.  
  
"I'm looking forward to that! It will be a good motivation for Mitsui
too."  
"Alright, today is a celebration for tomorrow!"  
  
Aoi said that and suddenly stood up.  
  
"Today, I'll cast a healing spell on everyone when we're done! So you
don't have to worry about a hangover! Everyone, it's a kindness from
Queen Dustis! Let's drink a lot!"  
  
Hisui said with a wry smile, continuing Aoi's words.  
  
"I guarantee the amazingness of Aoi's healing! Everyone, don't worry."  
  
The banquet became lively at those words.  
  
"Woah, if Miss Hisui says so, I believe it! Let's drink!"  
  
Aoi happily took a drink and went into the circle of knights. The
drinking contest began...
