# Chapter 121: The Strongest Maid is Born

Aoi declared to α Squad that they would be departing for the 6th Seal.  
  
"…So, we'll be leaving at noon."  
"Miss Aoi, we're ready to go right now…"  
"Yeah, well, I promised Hisui I'd be there. To engrave the rail cannon.
So, please wait a bit."  
"Eh, not a railgun, but a rail cannon?"  
  
Mikazuchi asked with a surprised expression.  
  
"Yeah. It seems to be more amazing than a railgun. Oh, and I'll be
getting a maid."  
  
Aoi beckoned, and Marsim timidly entered from the shadow of the door.  
  
"I'm Marsim. Nice to meet you all."  
"Oh my, Miss Marsim. That's wonderful."  
  
Luca looked happy and delighted.  
  
"Yes, everyone. It's a pleasure to meet you."  
  
Marsim greeted them, looking a little nervous.  
  
"Alright, let's meet up at noon then. I'll be with Hisui."  
  
—  
  
"Aoi, please put the light engraving here and here."  
"Sure thing."  
  
Aoi and Hisui were side-by-side, applying engraving magic to the rail
cannon. Susano and Marsim stood nearby, watching them.  
  
"Haa… Miss Hisui is becoming more and more distant…"  
"That's not true. Hisui is smart, kind, calm, beautiful, and strong,
but…"  
"But?"  
"Like Aoi, she's a bit of an airhead, so I think it would be better if
someone looked after her."  
  
Marsim thought about Hisui's actions up until now.  
  
"That's true!"  
"So, Marsim, please take good care of Hisui, okay?"  
  
Marsim took Susano's hand and gripped it firmly.  
  
"Leave it to me! Miss Hisui, well, Miss Aoi too… I'll take
responsibility for looking after them!"  
  
Just as Marsim declared this, Hisui said,  
  
"It's doneーー!"  
  
In a cheerful voice.  
  
"Alright! Let's do a test shot!"  
"Yes, let's!"  
  
Susano and Marsim exchanged glances. Wait a minute…?? A test shot with a
railgun that's even more powerful than yesterday's?? Right now? Here?  
  
"Wait a minute!! You two, wait a minute!!"  
  
Marsim frantically stopped Aoi and Hisui.  
  
"If you do a test shot! Right now!! Right here!!! It'll cause a huge
uproar. We should notify everyone before we test it…"  
  
Aoi and Hisui looked at each other.  
  
"I guess you're right…"  
  
Marsim thought to herself.  
  
(T, this airhead duo!! I have to take care of them properly!)  
  
It was the moment that Aoi’s maid, who would later be known as the
"Perfect and Strongest Maid," was born.  
  
—  
  
"What about Mars and the others?"  
"We'll stay here and wait for the next seal operation."  
"Dustis, next is Fenrir at the 3rd Seal, right?"  
"That's right. Shurak’s Knights and Count Mars' Knights will handle
it."  
  
Aoi nodded and said to the Fire Dragon Flail, who was standing by her
side.  
  
"Flail. You will work with Mars and the others."  
"As you wish."  
"Just asking, but can you beat Fenrir?"  
"Well, it won't be easy, but with allies, I don't think we'll lose."  
  
Aoi felt like teasing Flail, who was only being modest in his words, but
seemed confident.  
  
"What, what? You're being so modestーー."  
"Yes! In truth, I thought it would be easy, but I thought that if I were
to win easily, it might not convey my greatness to my Lord, so I feigned
modesty."  
"Oh, oh. You talk a big game. Well, I'm counting on you."  
  
Marsim got a headache. Weren't there any normal people? Marsim had
vaguely realized that Mao, whom she had been relying on, was actually a
musclehead.  
  
(Is Miss Hisui being influenced by Miss Aoi?? Her airheadedness is
getting even more powerful…)  
  
But Marsim was unusually determined.  
  
(As a maid, I will guide these people!)  
  
And with that.
