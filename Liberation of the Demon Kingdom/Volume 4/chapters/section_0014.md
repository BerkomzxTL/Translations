# Chapter 99: Golem Hunting

"...Mao, so I'm leaving the advance team to α Squad."  
  
Aoi said, pointing at the map to Mao.  
  
"Okay, sure. So, I just have to provoke the golems beyond this A,
right?"  
"Be careful, they appear suddenly from the ground once you cross the A
line."  
"Got it. What do we do after crossing?"  
"Well, run back with everything you've got. Don't die! After that, we'll
join up and finish off any golems that were missed."  
"O-okay. I'll do my best."  
  
—  
  
The next day at noon. The operation began.  
α Squad was walking through the desert while searching for enemies. Mao,
who grew up in a large forest, grimaced each time her feet were caught
in the fine sand.  
  
"Luca, are there any signs of golems yet?"  
  
α Squad was almost at the A line.  
  
"I can't tell at all. Are they really here?"  
"Hmm. I don't sense anything either. But it's Aoi we're talking
about..."  
"We're about to cross the A line."  
  
Vice Squad Leader Mikazuchi calmly announced. Judging from the distance
to the tower, they should be beyond the A line.  
At that moment. Countless red lights flickered on the ground. Like a
city burning in the ravages of war.  
  
"Oh, there are so many presences! I can't even count them all!!"  
  
Luca shouted loudly.  
  
"Alright, everyone. Full power! Let's run!"  
  
As agreed beforehand, Force released a ball of light into the sky. It
was the signal that they had encountered the golems.  
The moment the ball of light burst in the sky, massive attacks of earth
and water began. The wind user grasped the golems' positions and sniped
them.  
  
"Oh, amazing, amazing!"  
  
The golems were being destroyed one after another. Some had their heads
blown off, while others had their legs crushed. No golems were
approaching α Squad. However, there were a lot of golems. Countless
golems appeared one after another.  
  
"Run, run! There are some that got past!"  
  
Mikazuchi said as if shouting. Just as α Squad was about to reach the B
line, several golems broke through the A line.  
At that moment, three black golems suddenly appeared and stopped the
golems that had crossed the A line.  
The black golems collided with the others, but the black golems were
strong. They swung their arms and struck the golems' heads, blowing them
off and immobilizing them.  
  
"It's a Hisui golem!"  
  
Mao said happily.  
  
"The B line is just a little further. Do your best."  
  
The Hisui black golems were holding the A line, but there were too many.
Golems began to cross the A line in areas that they couldn't cover.  
  
"Alright, stop the magic attacks! We'll engage in close combat as it
is!"  
  
Aoi released a signal ball of light and burst it in the sky.  
At this signal, the magic attacks stopped, and the mercenary corps and
the knights attacked from both sides of the golems. The breakthrough
point was the Hisui black golems. The three black golems kicked away the
other golems and charged into the large hoard, crushing opponents as
they went.  
  
"Alright, let's continue following the Hisui golems!"  
  
The mercenary corps used a tactic of three people per golem to steadily
reduce the number. On the opposite side, the knights were steadily
destroying the golems.  
  
"Miss Aoi, Hisui! We've joined up!"  
  
Mao came to Hisui's side and said.  
  
"α Squad is all safe. But Luca..."  
"Miss Aoi, near the tower. It's not emitting any magicules yet, but
something tremendously large is lurking."  
  
A considerable number of golems had been destroyed, and the number of
active golems could be counted. About 30 remaining .  
  
"Aoi, Miss Luca is right. Dark magicules are swirling near the tower."  
  
Dark magicules are difficult for other users to detect. Aoi and Hisui
had also felt the abnormality at the tower. As did Shurak of the
knights.  
Light magic was fired from the knight's side to signal an abnormality.  
  
"They've noticed it on that side too. Mao, there are few golems left.
Destroy all the golems as it is. I'll leave the command to you. Susano,
stay with Mao. Hisui and I will go to the tower."  
  
Mao nodded and looked back at the members of α Squad.  
  
"We'll destroy the remaining golems as it is. We'll lead the way. Force!
Signal for a full-scale attack!"  
  
Force burst light magic in the sky.  
  
"Susano, don't leave my side."  
  
After seeing Mao and the others in α Squad run off, Aoi lightly touched
Hisui's shoulder.  
  
"Alright, let's go! Partner!"  
"Yes, let's go!"
