# Chapter 146: Fragment 3

**Last chapter of  -Complementary Story- Fragments**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
"Hah, hah, hah."  
  
Mirai and Misuzu were panting. They didn't know how long they had been
running. They noticed Yorda and Marni nearby.  
  
"We couldn't save them..."  
  
Yorda muttered, but everyone knew it was impossible.  
  
"Even so, this place... the miasma is even thicker..."  
  
Marni said, enduring it with a distorted face.  
  
"Big sister!!"  
  
At that moment, Mirai saw it at the very back of the ruins.  
  
"Is it... alive??"  
  
Misuzu's voice trembled.  
It had an ugly appearance. Gigantic. So many ominous magicules! The
space seemed distorted. A distorted, ancient weapon that shouldn't exist
in this world.  
  
"A Demon God!"  
  
Mirai screamed. No. They shouldn't get involved with that. Mirai's
instincts whispered.  
The other three felt the same. A fundamental fear inherent in humans.  
  
"R-run..."  
  
They didn't know who said it. It suddenly happened to the five people
who were about to run.  
  
'You are insignificant compared to me...'  
  
Those words echoed directly inside Mirai and Misuzu's heads.  
  
"Ah, ah, ah"  
  
Misuzu couldn't stop trembling. Even so, she managed to draw her sword
and enveloped her blade with magicules.  
  
"!"  
  
The Demon God moved. No, the Demon God was connected by a giant chain.
What moved was the Demon God's...  
  
"Head!"  
  
The Demon God's head fell, transforming into a grotesque shape. Many
centipede-like legs sprouted from beneath the jaw. The tongue stretched
out, emitting a foul odor. The eyes popped out and hung down from the
eye sockets. The liquid that fell from those eye sockets evaporated when
it touched the ground.  
  
"Ugh, uwaーー"  
  
Yorda used magicules to create a blade of light and unleashed it at the
Demon God.  
  
"Mr. Yorda! No good!"  
  
The blade of light didn't reach the Demon God's head. It was scattered
into mist, blocked by the overwhelming concentration of magicules.  
  
'Pshew'  
  
With a strange sound, the Demon God thrust its tongue out at Yorda. The
tip was sharp, and it pierced Yorda's head. With a splattering sound,
Yorda fell to the ground, scattering his brains.  
  
"Big sister! Run away! I'll hold it back!"  
  
Mirai was desperate. Her beloved sister, the sister who looked happy
when she said she would get married, the kind sister who was always by
her side, the strong and reliable sister when they went on adventures.  
She wanted her big sister to be happy. That was Mirai's strong wish.  
  
(And. And we can't let this thing out of these ruins!)  
  
Mirai gathered magicules, created countless balls of light, and
unleashed them at the Demon God.  
However, the magic didn't reach it.  
  
"Here!"  
"Sister!"  
  
Misuzu's powerful, overhand strike, infused with her spirit, seemed to
hit the Demon God's temple.  
  
"My sword!"  
  
Misuzu's sword, swung, was blocked by the Demon God's magicules and
broke at the base.  
  
"We can't let this thing out of the ruins! Mirai, and I can't run away,
leaving you..."  
  
The Demon God stared at Mirai and Misuzu with empty, hollow eyes.  
  
'DOGAN'  
  
The ceiling above the Demon God collapsed, and a large stone block fell
onto the Demon God's head. However, the Demon God trembled slightly, and
the stone block shattered. The Demon God's gaze focused on Marni, who
had dropped the stone.  
  
"Miss Marni! Run away quickly!"  
  
The dark magicules released from the Demon God shattered the wall near
Marni.  
  
"I'll avenge Yorda..."  
  
Marni, smiling awkwardly at Mirai, was struck by a deflected stone and
disappeared from sight.  
  
"Miss Marni!"  
  
But Mirai and Misuzu had no time to help Marni.  
  
"Mirai! That’s dark magic!!"  
  
It was dark magic. Magic that both Mirai and Misuzu knew nothing
about.  
A torrent of dark magicules poured from the Demon God's wide-open mouth,
directed at Mirai and Misuzu.  
  
"B, Big sister!"  
  
Mirai positioned her sword in front of her, and stood in front of
Misuzu, desperately resisting.  
  
"Big sister! Big sister! Big sister, it's me!"  
  
Misuzu also hugged Mirai from behind, circulating magicules throughout
her body and giving all of her magicules to Mirai.  
The dark magicules raged, trying to swallow the two small lights.  
  
"Big sister!"  
"Mirai!"  
  
At that moment, the two were bound strongly by magicules. Because they
were sisters, because they cared for each other, because they were
irreplaceable existences.  
That connection of magicules became a corridor connecting their souls.  
  
"Big sister, I'm sorry. I couldn't celebrate your wedding..."  
"No, I'm happy that I could be with you until the end, Mirai."  
"Big sister, we can't let that out. Sorry, but... with me."  
  
What did Mirai try to say after that? But Misuzu didn't care about
that.  
  
"Yes."  
  
The two burned their lives. They put all of their magicules into
unleashing light magic. It was a tiny, tiny light in front of the Demon
God. But their feelings caused a miracle. The Demon God's movement
stopped. The Demon God's head was pushed back into the Demon God's body,
guided by the trajectory of the two lights.  
  
"Big sister!"  
"Mirai!"  
  
Those were the last words of the two. The two's lives burned out,
binding their souls together.  
Putting the Demon God back to sleep...  
  
—  
  
Marni woke up in the dark ruins. The miasma that had been so thick was
gone.  
  
"Miss Mirai! Miss Misuzu!"  
  
There was no answer to Marni's call.  
  
"Miss Mirai! Miss Misuzu!"  
  
Marni was certain of one thing. The certainty that Mirai and Misuzu had
sacrificed their lives to calm the Demon God.  
  
"This ruin must not be opened..."  
  
Marni dragged her aching body towards the exit of the ruins.  
To put this ruin back to sleep. To not waste the deaths of Mirai and
Misuzu, and their comrades who died in the ruins.  
  
"Out of the ruins..."  
  
And so, the ruins were sealed. Until a man named Buenos was possessed by
dark ambition and broke the seal. They entered a long, long sleep.  
  
—  
  
The soul that was Mirei and Mirai walked a dark and long path. How much
time did it spend? One day, the soul was sent from the dark and
comfortable place to a bright world.  
And the soul cried out.  
  
"Ogyaa ogyaa"  
"We finally meet, my baby. Hello. You are *'Aoi'* . My beloved..."  
  
The baby named Aoi was held in her mother's arms and soon began to sleep
soundly. As if taking a rest before the harsh fate that lay ahead.  
  
—  
  
And many years passed.  
Hisui, as a knight apprentice of the Mars territory, was participating
in the battle on the Sugal Plain, acting as a messenger.  
Large-scale dark magic was deployed, and both armies were in a chaotic
melee. Hisui was desperate. She swung her rapier, how many enemies did
she cut down? But she was at her limit. Her arm couldn't move anymore.  
  
(I don't want to die here...)  
  
Still, Hisui was working hard. To the Count of Mars! Bearing the written
message entrusted to her by the Royal Guard Knights of the Asura
Kingdom.  
Then. By chance, an arrow pierced Hisui's chest.  
  
"Ah!"  
  
Hisui reflexively pulled the arrow out of her chest.  
  
(Oh, this might be bad.)  
  
Hisui thought so. The arrow had pierced Hisui's left chest.  
  
(Am I going to die...)  
  
Hisui's consciousness became cloudy.  
Then. A thought-wave in the battlefield spread.  
  
'I shall release the curse!'  
  
Hisui, in her fading consciousness, felt a sense of nostalgia for a
"voice" she should have heard for the first time.  
  
"Mirai..."  
  
Unconsciously, Hisui was calling the name of the person who was likely
the owner of the voice. But Hisui's consciousness was vague.  
  
"Ah, how beautiful..."  
  
Particles of light and darkness were dancing on the battlefield. The
particles surrounded Hisui and permeated into her body. And it healed
Hisui's wounds...  
  
(How peaceful...)  
  
Then, Hisui heard a voice.  
  
'Big sister, there's something you have to do. You can't die in a place
like this...'  
  
"Mirai!"  
  
Hisui called that name again. And Hisui's consciousness awakened.  
  
"Huh? Me... didn't I get hurt?"  
  
Hisui no longer remembered calling Mirai's name, nor hearing Mirai's
voice. There were no injuries that should have been there.  
  
(Did I have a dream...)  
  
Before she knew it, the dance of light and darkness particles had spread
throughout the entire Sugal Plain. And all the fighting had stopped.
People were just staring at this grand spectacle.  
  
"What a warm power..."  
  
Hisui was moved by the power of those particles.  
  
'PANG'  
  
With a loud explosion, the magicules and particles that had covered the
Sugal Plain scattered. The seal was broken.  
Hisui was staring at the "warrior" who had formed this trajectory in the
sunset. The warrior slowly descended to the ground.  
  
"That's Mirai... Huh? What did I just say?"  
  
Hisui held that nostalgic feeling and felt hope in this battlefield. The
hope that the warrior had brought. The hope that the dance of light and
darkness particles had shown her!  
Hisui, with hope in her heart, ran again towards Count Mars. The
fighting had stopped. Hisui's feelings were without hesitation, as if
running towards a fulfilled future.  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
I was able to write about the question "Why is Hisui the 'other half' of
Aoi?" that I was concerned about.  
I couldn't put it in the main story, and it ended up like this.  
After this, I want to write a few more stories about the characters'
aftermath.  
  
Fragment. Three fragmentary stories. I hope you can read them together
with the main story!
