# Chapter 107: Everyone's Thoughts

"Morse, what do you think is the goal of the Order of Chaos?"  
"I don't know. I have no idea. However..."  
  
Morse hesitated for a moment, but quickly continued.  
  
"Buenos is an ambitious man. Perhaps he's trying to obtain dark
magicules using the engraved circles?"  
"I was thinking that too. If so, it's understandable why they wouldn't
interfere with the unsealing. Kidnapping children and creating cursed
swords might also be to suppress the engraved circles by attacking the
Demon City after the seals are broken... What does everyone think?"  
"The recent movements of the Order don't seem to be inheriting the ideas
of the Demon God of Chaos."  
  
Luca said to Aoi.  
  
"I am 300 years old. The Demon God of Chaos is not a legend, but a
memory. I don't feel any intention in the Order to protect the world
from destruction."  
  
Aoi nodded deeply at Luca's words. Then, she looked around at everyone
again.  
  
"I want to ask you again. I want to break the seals and destroy the
circles. Please lend me your strength. I beg you."  
  
Aoi bowed deeply.  
  
"Aoi, I’m with you."  
"Yeah, me too."  
  
The members of α Squad also nodded powerfully.  
  
"Commander Aoi. I'm very happy to be chosen for α Squad. I can fight for
my kingdom. This, I'm proud of. Commander Aoi, you don't need to bow
your head. This is our fight too."  
  
Zilberk spoke frankly. There was weight in his words, and Aoi felt
relieved.  
  
"Aoi, everyone's feelings are the same. And I would like to ask you
again. Please lend your strength to the liberation of the Demon
Kingdom."  
  
This was a request from Susano, as the next queen of the Demon Kingdom,
and also a wish as a sister who knew that Sheema was involved in the
series of events.  
Aoi smiled and nodded.  
  
—  
  
Aoi lifted the fifth seal. To be precise, Susano, who learned the method
of unsealing from Aoi, lifted it. The fifth seal was released.  
  
"Aoi, why didn't you remove the seal when you fought Morse before?"  
"Ah, Luke connected the guardian beast to the seal after he transferred
the dark magicules to me, so it wasn't that long ago. When I fought
Morse, it wasn't a guardian beast yet."  
  
(??)  
  
"What's wrong?"  
  
Hisui wondered again how old Aoi was, but didn't say it out loud.  
  
"Speaking of which, what is Morse going to do now? The miasma around
here will surely be cleared away."  
"I want to devote myself to magic research in a quiet place. Until now,
I couldn't do research because of Lord Luke."  
  
Morse seemed indifferent.  
  
"Okay, I understand. We'll be leaving for the Demon City tomorrow
morning. By then, please teach Mao spatial transfer magic. It's okay to
stay up all night!"  
  
Mao looked startled, then let out a pitiful voice.  
  
"Staying up all night is fine, but... I don't want to be alone with the
Lich at night... But I want to learn spatial transfer magic..."  
  
Hisui gave in to Mao's desperate eyes.  
  
"Okay, I'll accompany you."  
  
That night, a modest dinner was held in the tower, served by Morse's
servant (a ghost). However, Mao was not there due to magic training, and
Hisui was there to accompany her.  
  
(If Mao were here, she might have fainted instead...)  
  
Aoi, Susano, and the members of α Squad were deeply united in front of a
great goal.  
  
(I’m grateful to Morse for giving me this opportunity...)  
  
Aoi thought vaguely.
