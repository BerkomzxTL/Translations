# Chapter 117: Exchange Meeting (1)

That day, a gathering hosted by Dustis and Mars was to be held,
borrowing a mansion in a neighboring village. Surely, Squad Leader Zilba
was the most excited. Last time, he couldn't participate in the dinner
with Hisui because he was on a reconnaissance mission.  
Moreover, he only found out that Hisui was coming on the day of the
operation. Of course, he was on a separate mission from Hisui, so he
couldn't even talk to her, let alone meet her.  
  
(Yes! I can meet Miss Hisui! I can thank her for what happened back
then!) ※  
  
Zilba was cheerfully preparing to leave.  
  
"Squad Leader, you seem to be having fun."  
"Yeah, it seems Miss Hisui is coming to today's gathering."  
  
Half of Zilba's squad died in the battle with the Order of Chaos back
then. Five new members were assigned to Zilba's squad, but for the five
veterans, Hisui had become a savior, a goddess-like existence.  
  
"So it seems. I'm looking forward to it too!"  
"That's right. I heard Miss Hisui has become even more beautiful."  
"Wow, Miss Hisui, who was already beautiful, is even more beautiful?!
Squad Leader. Let's finish packing up quickly and go to the venue."  
  
The speed of Zilba's squad that day was amazing. Mars, who was doing the
inspection, was astonished.  
  
—  
  
Aoi was worried. How should she introduce Flail?  
Dustis and Mars are fine. She had explained in advance that Flail would
be her servant. The problem is today's gathering. She was planning to
send Flail to the Demon City, but if that's the case, she has no choice
but to introduce him to everyone.  
  
"Haa... this guy is leaking magicules like crazy."  
  
No matter how you look at him, Flail was no ordinary person. She could
feel a tremendous amount of magicules. His movements were flawless. And
such a guy was bowing down to Aoi.  
  
"Haaa... I'm going to be called a monster again..."  
  
Aoi wasn't bothered by being called a monster, but she hated that no one
would drink with her at banquets.  
  
"Aoi, why are you sighing?"  
  
Aoi confided her worries to Hisui.  
  
"Is that all? It's okay, I'll drink with you."  
"Eh?"  
"You have me, Aoi."  
  
Hmm. That's not quite it, Aoi thought, but drinking with Hisui is also
fun.  
  
"Okay, I get it. There's no point worrying about it! Shall we go to the
venue?"  
"Miss Aoi, I'll drink with you too."  
  
Following Mao, the members of α squad also nodded.  
  
"Yes! Aoi! Me too!"  
  
Susano can't drink! Aoi thought, but she was happy with everyone's
feelings.  
  
"Alright! It's early, but let's go to the venue and start ahead of
everyone!!"  
  
—  
  
Aoi, Zilba, and the others entered the venue at just about the same
time.  
  
"Miss Hisu...i...."  
  
When Zilba saw Hisui, he tried to call out to her, but he immediately
realized that the members around Hisui were no ordinary people, so he
hesitated.  
  
"Ah! Squad Leader Zilba!!"  
  
Without noticing Zilba's reaction, Hisui waved her hand.  
  
"It's been a while."  
  
Hisui took Zilba's hand and shook it firmly. Zilba was happy to see
Hisui, but his instincts as a warrior overcame that joy.  
Zilba pulled Hisui into the shadows and whispered in her ear.  
  
"Miss Hisui. Who are those guys? They're all dangerous, but that tall
man, that high elf, and that little girl are especially dangerous.
What's going on?"  
  
Ah, the bob-haired girl is normal, Zilba thought, but he didn't say it
out loud.  
  
"Yes. They are all my squad members."  
  
Hisui said that and pulled Zilba toward Aoi.  
  
"Squad Leader Zilba, I'll introduce everyone later. First, let me
introduce my partner. She is the Commander of the Aoi Mercenary Corps,
an SSS-Rank knight of the Asura Kingdom and an SSS-Rank knight of the
Demon Kingdom."  
  
"Ah, you're the Squad Leader of the Mars Knights, who encountered
Buenos, right? I’m Aoi. Nice to meet you."  
  
(Aoi is the one who is rumored to have subdued an ancient dragon? This
person who is full of openings?? Even so, what kind of joke is it to be
SSS-Rank in the Asura Kingdom and the Demon Kingdom??)  
  
"The pleasure is mine. Miss Hisui saved my life in that battle with
Buenos."  
  
Aoi nodded and shifted her gaze behind Zilba.  
  
"Hehehe, everyone. You want to chat with Hisui, right? There's alcohol
over there, so let's just start drinking!"  
  
Aoi called out to the members of Zilba's squad who were standing by
behind Zilba.  
  
"That's right. I want to talk too. It's okay! If you say you were
forcibly invited by Aoi, most things will be forgiven! I guarantee
it!"  
  
With Hisui's declaration, the banquet began in a slipshod manner.
