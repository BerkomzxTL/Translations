# Chapter 105 Lich

A map of the Demon Kingdom was spread out in Dustis' office. The
location of the seal was marked.  
  
"The 5th seal is about 4 days away in terms of distance."  
"I don't think there will be any combat this time, but I want to be
fully prepared. I'm planning to go with a total of 7 people from the
mercenary corps, including me, Hisui, and α Squad."  
"Miss Aoi, I have a request. I've also spoken with Her Majesty Dustis.
Could you please take Susano with you?"  
  
Aoi couldn't help but look at Dustis after hearing Shurak's proposal.
Dustis nodded slightly.  
  
"I want the next Queen of the Demon Kingdom to witness the outcome of
the seal that will determine the fate of the Demon Kingdom."  
  
Aoi could see the affection for Susano in Shurak's serious expression.  
  
"Yes. I have no objections. What about Hisui?"  
"Yes, I have no objections either."  
"Then Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. Please take care of Susano."  
  
Shurak bowed deeply.  
  
"Aoi, when are we departing?"  
"In about 3 days, after we've prepared everything. The 5th seal is in a
wasteland filled with miasma, so we'll need appropriate equipment."  
  
Aoi said this to Hisui and then stood up energetically.  
  
"Dustis. Depending on the story, we might end up dispelling the 5th
seal. Is that okay?"  
  
Dustis nodded strongly.  
  
"In this matter, I have complete faith in Aoi. In the name of Dustis, I
leave the decision to Aoi."  
"Thank you, Dustis."  
  
Aoi was grateful for Dustis' consideration. She bowed her head to Dustis
in her heart.  
  
"Also, I sent a letter to Berg using a carrier pigeon. I told him about
the circumstances leading up to this, the treatment of Aoi and Miss
Hisui, and to please be aware that we might need the Asura Kingdom army
to move."  
"Right. The information we get from the Lich will be even more
important."  
  
Dustis' expression became serious as she looked into Aoi's eyes.  
  
"Aoi, don't be reckless."  
"Yeah, I won't do anything that would make Hisui sad again."  
  
Dustis looked at Hisui and nodded.  
  
"If there's anything you need for preparations, just let me know."  
  
—  
  
Three days later, Aoi and Susano rode on Kamo, and Hisui rode on Gamo,
heading towards the 5th seal. Dustis had lent Gamou birds to α Squad,
and everyone except Mao was riding them. Mao was still riding the
horse-lizard Artesia as usual.  
  
"Miss Mao, I've always wondered, what is that creature?"  
  
Susano asked with sparkling eyes, but Mao's face was gloomy.  
  
"It was given to me by the dragon knight Lord Aldey... but I don't
really know. No one knows..."  
"I, I see... But it's cute? Isn't it...?"  
"You don't have to force yourself. It's not cute..."  
  
Artesia neighed unhappily, "Bu-mooo."  
  
"Even your cries aren’t cute..."  
  
—  
  
As expected, the Order of Chaos didn't interfere along the way. Four
days after departing from the Demon Capital, the group smoothly arrived
at the swamp where the 5th seal was located.  
  
"Th, this is an amazing place. I actually hate ghosts. We'll be okay,
right?"  
"Well, the Lich is kind of like a ghost."  
  
Mao was frightened by Hisui's reply and anxiously grabbed Hisui's sleeve
from behind.  
They could see a tower, the same as the 1st seal, standing almost in the
center of the swamp.  
  
"Is that it..."  
  
Mikazuchi also spoke to Aoi with a worried look on his face.  
  
"That's right. I'm going to summon the Lich now, so don't be
surprised."  
  
Everyone was excited, wondering if Aoi was going to use summoning
magic.  
  
"Hisui. This is the first time I've seen summoning magic. I'm looking
forward to it."  
  
Aoi faced the tower and took a deep breath.  
  
"Oi, Morse! If you don't want a black hole blasted into the tower, show
yourself immediately!"  
  
Hisui and Susano whispered quietly.  
  
"Hisui, was that summoning magic just now?"  
"No, that was just a threat. Was Aoi a bully?"  
"Hey! I can hear everything!"  
  
Then, suddenly, the space in front of them cracked, and a creepy
skeleton appeared.  
  
"Hiiiiiii."  
  
Mao let out a scream that wasn't even a voice.  
  
However,  
  
"Lady Aoi, please, please have mercy... If you do such a thing, I’ll
disappear from this world..."  
  
Morse the Lich replied, sounding genuinely terrified.  
  
"See, I knew she was a bully..."  
  
Aoi pinched Hisui's cheek while facing Morse.  
  
"Morse, I came to talk to you today. Is there somewhere we can talk
undisturbed?"  
"Please, this way."  
  
Morse opened a hole in space and invited everyone.  
  
"Come, this way. It leads to the inside of the tower."  
  
Aoi, accompanied by Morse, entered first.  
  
"Yeah, it's okay."  
  
With those words, everyone stepped into the hole in space.
