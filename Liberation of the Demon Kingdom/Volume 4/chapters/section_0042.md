# Chapter 127: In the Demon City

An unsettling atmosphere hangs in the air before the final seal's
dispelling...  
  
Dark magic, when mastered, allows one to manipulate time. Aoi might be
unconsciously manipulating time, perhaps having visions of the future.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The Demon City. Population: 300,000. Covered in dense magicules, the
average lifespan of its residents is 15 years shorter than in the Asura
Kingdom.  
Its main industries are processing and distributing magic stones. The
Demon Kingdom has abundant magic stone deposits, so many people are
involved in these industries. Agriculture and animal husbandry are also
extremely inefficient due to the magicules. It is, in short, an
inhospitable land.  
  
Dustis was looking down at the Demon City from the royal castle. She had
confirmed the dispelling of the 6th seal three days ago. The 3rd and 4th
seals would be dispelled soon as well.  
The 3rd seal had a joint operation underway by the Knights led by Shurak
and the Mars Knights of the Asura Kingdom, and the 4th seal had a joint
operation by the mercenary corps led by Bardock and the Royal Knights of
the Asura Kingdom. The Flame Dragon Flail is participating in the 3rd
seal's dispelling operation. Furthermore, the Royal Knights of the Asura
Kingdom were commanded by Vice Commander Fulsenia, and Susano, the next
queen of the Demon Kingdom, was accompanying them.  
  
"It's all thanks to Aoi..."  
  
Dustis wanted to save the Demon Kingdom. She wanted to purify the
magicules that were corroding everything. That was becoming a reality.
However, the Order of Chaos that she was concerned about remained
inactive. It was ominous.  
  
"There's no way nothing will happen..."  
  
The security in the Demon City was as strict as if it were wartime.
However, Dustis' anxiety only grew.  
  
"Lady Dustis, Lady Aoi has returned."  
"I see. I'll go at once."  
  
Receiving the report from her subordinate, Dustis immediately headed to
the audience chamber.  
  
(Aoi... I guess I'll have to rely on you again...)  
  
Dustis respected Aoi as a friend. Because she respected and trusted her,
she also understood that Aoi was bearing too much of the Demon God's
sins.  
  
(If Hisui wasn't here, I wouldn't have been able to ask Aoi to dispel
the seals.)  
  
Aoi had changed. After gaining a partner named Hisui, she started
relying on her companions. The "danger" Dustis had felt from Aoi had
disappeared, and she felt an even stronger sense of strength. That Aoi
had dispelled the 6th seal and returned. With her companions. Dustis was
happy about that.  
  
(The old Aoi would have gone alone. And pushed herself too hard...
Hehehe. Aoi has found a good partner.)  
  
Dustis opened the door to the audience chamber.  
  
"Dustis! I'm back!"  
  
There stood Aoi with a bright smile. Together with her reliable
companions. Dustis narrowed her eyes at the dazzling sight. Tears ran
down her cheeks.  
  
(Aoi's going to call me a crybaby again...)  
  
Dustis thought so, but she couldn't stop the tears from streaming down
her cheeks.  
  
—  
  
"Dustis is such a crybaby."  
"I knew you'd say that..."  
"Yeah. Dustis, I dispelled the 6th seal. It's almost over."  
"Yes. Aoi, thank you..."  
"We're heading to the 7th seal in 10 days. Until then, we'll prepare in
the Demon City."  
  
Dustis looked at Aoi's companions, who were smiling behind her, and
said,  
  
"Please tell me anything you need. I'll provide as much assistance as I
can!"  
  
Everyone nodded in agreement at Dustis' words. Dustis suddenly recalled
the old days. Berg, Anna, Aldey, Jinrai. And the memories of her journey
with Aoi.  
"I once drew a picture for Aoi, didn't I?"  
"Huh? Oh. It's displayed in my house in the Asura Kingdom."  
"Once the dispelling of the seals is complete, would you let me draw a
picture of this party?"  
  
Everyone exchanged glances, but Mikazuchi immediately answered.  
  
"It would be a great honor."  
  
Dustis nodded and imagined herself drawing a picture of Aoi and the
others in the Demon City, which would soon be free of magicules and a
refreshing land.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui, do you have any plans for tomorrow?"  
"No, not particularly, but..."  
"Then, let's walk around the Demon City. The security is tight, but I'm
sure we'll find something new."  
  
Aoi and Hisui, along with the seven members of α Squad, were scheduled
to depart for the 7th seal the day after tomorrow. The 3rd and 4th seals
had been conquered by the allied forces of the Demon Kingdom and the
Asura Kingdom, and had already been dispelled. The 7th seal was the last
seal of the barrier that was corroding the Demon Kingdom.  
Before departing for the 7th seal, Aoi had a premonition.  
  
(I might die...)  
  
It was a vague feeling, and Aoi herself did not think it was a definite
future.  
  
(But my intuition is usually right...)  
  
That's why Aoi wanted to walk around the Demon City with Hisui. She
wanted to let it sink in, with Hisui, that they were liberating this
Demon City, no, this Demon Continent.  
  
"Aoi, is something wrong?"  
"Is there?"  
"Yes, there is."  
  
Hisui was suspicious of Aoi, who was different than usual, but she
agreed to Aoi's invitation.  
  
"What's wrong all of a sudden?"  
"Well, I was thinking I wanted to go on a date with Hisui."  
"Oh, my. Isn't that embarrassing?"  
  
While feeling healed by Hisui, who was blushing and embarrassed, Aoi was
filled with anxiety.  
  
(I have to protect Hisui and everyone...)  
  
"Hehehe, I want to dress up tomorrow. Aoi, can you help me pick out an
outfit? I'm still not confident in my sense of style..."  
"If you're influenced by Count Mars, you'll lose confidence. Alright!
Leave it to Aoi!!"  
"Really? I'm so happy. Where should we go tomorrow?"  
"The Demon City is where magic stones produced on the Demon Continent
gather, so there might be some rare magic stones and magic tools. Oh,
and they also sell artifacts from the Magic Kingdom era."  
"Artifacts from the Magic Kingdom era!!"  
  
Hisui's eyes sparkled. Aoi was desperate to suppress the urge to hug
Hisui in order to dispel her anxiety.  
  
"Yeah. Hisui, let's have fun tomorrow!"  
"Aoi?"  
  
Hisui did not miss the shadow on Aoi's face.  
  
(Aoi... what's wrong?)
