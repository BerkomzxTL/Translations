# Chapter 135: Large-Scale Dark Magic

In the attack on the castle, ranged magic attacks don't have much effect
because the opponent's users resist them.  
Physical attacks using water or earth magic are similarly resisted
before the magic is completed, so these aren't very effective either.  
The most effective magic attacks are those launched up close after
breaking through the enemy lines, a dirty method. In the first place,
it's rare to find users who can perform ranged attacks powerful enough
to be unresistable; Aoi and Hisui are exceptions.  
Both armies were exchanging small-scale magic attacks as a
reconnaissance, but for the aforementioned reasons, neither side
suffered major damage.  
It was noon, right in the middle of these skirmishes. With the sun
glaring down, Hisui issued the order to attack to the mercenary corps.  
It was a furious assault. The three golems controlled by Zilberk
scattered the soldiers of the Order. Using that as a breakthrough, 1,000
mercenaries, mainly from β Squad, charged in. Many of the Order's
soldiers carried magic swords, but the golems resisted the effects of
the magic swords, so they didn't have much impact. The mercenary corps
succeeded in deeply penetrating the Order's vanguard in the initial
attack.  
  
"Fall back 300 meters while using the golems as shields! Hurry!"  
  
Following Bardock's instructions, the mercenary corps, which had been
pushing forward, retreated 300 meters like a receding wave. The Order's
commander was wary of ranged magic attacks. A superior force retreating
usually meant a trap or a large-scale barrage was coming.  
The Order's commander ordered his subordinates to prepare to resist.
However, what came was a "cannon shot" fired from the roof of the royal
castle.  
Yes, it was the rail cannon fired by Hisui. The shell landed right next
to the commander, exploding and engulfing many soldiers. With this
attack, the Order's vanguard lost its command structure.  
However, the shelling didn't stop. A second and third shot landed a
short distance away soon after. The royal castle fired a total of three
shots, but the effect was devastating.  
Hisui and Luca, clad in Dragon Armament, were on the roof of the royal
castle.  
  
"Hisui, it's extremely effective. They landed in good positions."  
  
Luca smiled and said to Hisui.  
  
"Yes... but it's too fragile. There's something..."  
  
It was at that moment that Hisui felt uneasy. A large-scale dark magic
spell was deployed. The area was covered in darkness, making it
impossible to see even an inch ahead. At the same time, the sound
disappeared.  
  
It was like a recreation of the Sugal Plains. The only difference was
that the sound wasn't completely gone.  
  
"Miss Hisui!"  
  
Luca's voice calling out to Hisui could be heard faintly. Hisui feared
that the melee of the Sugal Plains would be recreated. Buenos' aim was
still the engraving circle. Guided by Luca's voice, Hisui went to her
side and grabbed her hand.  
  
"Luca! Can you sense the space?"  
  
Luca answered Hisui's faintly audible voice.  
  
"Yes! I can!"  
"Luca! We're going to the golems. Guide me!"  
  
Hisui put Luca in the Dragon Armament and jumped off the roof.  
  
—  
  
A little before the large-scale dark magic was used, Aoi had noticed
that a magicules user similar to Susano was attempting magic.  
  
"Marsim!"  
  
Marsim felt a chill run down her spine at Aoi's urgent voice.  
  
"Miss Aoi?"  
"A large-scale spell is about to be used. If they pull this off, it'll
be a melee like the Sugal Plains. We have to stop it. I'm going to
resist this large-scale magic. But I'm sure I won't be able to move.
Once I can't move, I want you to take me to Hisui. Can you do that for
me?"  
  
Marsim stared intently into Aoi's eyes. They weren't the eyes of someone
who had resigned to death.  
  
(Aoi's eyes. They're still shining.)  
  
"Understood. I will definitely take you to Miss Hisui."  
  
It was the moment Marsim answered. The area was enveloped in darkness,
and the sound disappeared.  
  
"Miss Aoi!"  
  
Marsim's  voice echoed faintly. Then Marsim felt light magicules
condensing right next to her. Those magicules were very refreshing, and
Marsim naturally shed tears when she felt them.  
  
"Miss Aoi!"  
  
The magicules exploded. Marsim could even see it. The explosion of
magicules was reduced to particles of light, dispelling the darkness.
The dance of light particles swept across the battlefield, completely
eliminating the darkness.  
  
"To think... you can do something like this. And these particles of
light are so beautiful..."  
  
Marsim became worried that these particles of light were Aoi's life
force.  
  
"Miss Aoi!"  
  
How many times had she called that name? There was no response. But Aoi
was there. She was slumped over, but Aoi was alive.  
  
"Aoi, you kept your promise. Now it's my turn to fulfill my promise."  
  
Marsim carried Aoi on her back and used wind magic to jump out of the
royal castle window. Towards Hisui.  
Marsim knew where Hisui was. Why did Marsim know where Hisui was? Marsim
didn't even know.  
  
(Surely, Aoi is guiding me.)  
  
Marsim ran through the city below the castle with Aoi on her back. The
city below the castle was in chaos. Due to the large-scale dark magic, a
portion of the Order's army had broken into the mercenary corps. But
fortunately, the chaos was only limited to a small number of units. The
place where the fighting was most intense was where the golems were
maintaining the front lines.  
  
"Hisui? Over there!"  
  
Marsim cast a wind barrier magic, drew her rapier, and ran towards the
golems.
