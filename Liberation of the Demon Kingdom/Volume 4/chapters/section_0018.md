# Chapter 103: The Meaning of the Seal

"Dustis! Is everything alright?"  
  
Aoi and Hisui left the command of the mercenary corps to Mao and, riding
on Kamo and Gamo, hurried back to the Demon City.  
  
"Aoi, Hisui. Over here."  
  
Dustis, seeing Aoi's unusually agitated state upon her hasty return, was
convinced that her premonition was correct. Dustis led them to the
basement of the castle.  
  
"There's been a change in the flow of magicules. I thought it was an
effect of the curse being lifted... but the cause is this. A relic from
the Magic Kingdom era. I wonder what kind of engraving it is?"  
  
"I think it started moving because we released the first seal... I
wonder what it is... it feels unpleasant..."  
  
"Aoi. I think this will activate if all the seals are released...
Perhaps the Demon God of Chaos sealed the entire Demon Continent to seal
this engraving circle?"  
  
"I was remembering an old story. The story of how Luke gained the power
of dark magicules and became the Demon God of Chaos.  
Luke was deceived and placed a huge engraving in the center of the Magic
Kingdom's capital. An engraving magic that steals magicules from all
living things and transfers it as dark magicules. Perhaps this is..."  
  
"Aoi... let's stop. The Demon God of Chaos' method of preventing the
development of magic in the world may have been wrong, but sealing this
engraving circle may have been for the sake of the world. This is very
dangerous."  
  
"Then what is the goal of the Order of Chaos? Is it to prevent the seals
from being broken?  
If they are inheriting the will of the Demon God of Chaos Luke, why
didn't they interfere with the unsealing of the first seal?"  
  
"Hisui is right. Dustis, let's investigate the other seals. The Order
may be trying to get us to break the seals.  
It was the same in the Sugal Plains. I only lifted the curse because the
two armies were in a fierce battle, and they were driven to the point
where they couldn't reconcile unless the curse was lifted. That dark and
wind grand magic was the trigger.  
Berg had no intention of destroying the Demon Kingdom army. He intended
to recommend surrender once he had them surrounded."  
"That's right. That magic caused a chaotic battle between the Demon
Kingdom army and the Asura army, and both Berg and I lost the
opportunity to stop the fighting.  
If Aoi hadn't lifted the curse on the Sugal Plains, which caused the
war, the Demon Kingdom might have been destroyed."  
  
"Is the Order of Chaos targeting this engraving circle from the Demon
Kingdom...?"  
  
"Aoi... can't this engraving be destroyed? If we can find out the full
extent of the circle, it should be possible."  
  
Aoi and Dustis couldn't nod easily to Hisui's words.  
  
"Is it impossible?"  
  
"I don't know... There are two reasons... One is that we can't
understand the entire picture unless we release all the seals. So we
don't know the points for destruction.  
The other is why Luke didn't destroy this engraving circle?  
Luke is the person responsible for placing this circle. Why did he take
the inefficient method of sealing instead of destroying it..?"  
  
"That's right. If that's the reason, it would be dangerous to break the
other seals..."  
  
Aoi had a stern look on her face. Hisui, worried that Aoi might break
down, gently hugged Aoi from behind.  
  
"Thank you, Hisui. I have a suggestion."  
  
Aoi said this and spoke while choosing her words carefully.  
  
"The fifth seal. A lich is guarding it. He was originally Luke's
right-hand man. He also cooperated when Luke placed the seals.  
He might know something about this engraving circle.  
Let's hear what he has to say. We can make a decision after that."  
  
Hisui and Dustis nodded.
