# Chapter 97: Susano

Aoi, Hisui, Mao, and Bardock were organizing the subjugation party for
the first seal.  
  
"Sis, how about a formation of 80 people centered around us this
time?"  
"Hmm. I'd like to ask the α Squad this time. From now on, the α Squad
will be mainly responsible for the dungeon strategies to remove the 6th
and 7th seals. For that purpose, I want to form a team mainly with the α
Squad to confirm our cooperation."  
  
Bardock looked very disappointed.  
  
"But we're planning to have the β Squad handle the 2nd to 5th seals."  
  
Bardock shook his head and said weakly.  
  
"I wanted to be with you, Sis. It's a shame, but if it's for your sake,
this Bardock will do his best!!"  
  
Bardock wanted to say that he would risk his life, but he knew that
Hisui disliked the idea of risking one's life, so he expressed his
determination in a modest way.  
  
"Okay, please take care of things while I'm away. We should also
consider the actions of the Order in the shadows, so please don't let
your guard down."  
  
Then Aoi spread out the mercenary corps member roster and looked around
at everyone.  
  
"Ahem, mass physical attacks are very effective against golems. Have the
wind users search for the enemy's position, and have the earth or water
users remotely launch mass attacks from effective positions.  
After that, we will break through with the knights, which will be done
by me, Hisui, and 40 members including the α Squad who are good at
swordsmanship.  
So, 10 wind users, 30 earth or water users, and 35 members who are good
at swordsmanship, plus the α Squad, Hisui, and me, for a total of 82
people.  
The enemy is 200 golems!  
Bardock, I'm really sorry, but could you please select the members
together with Mikazuchi?"  
"It's my pleasure, Sis!"  
"Okay, we'll leave in 10 days! Everyone, please prepare."

Aoi and Hisui were in Susano's room.  
Susano was told by Dustis to accompany Aoi and the others in dispelling
the first seal. Susano is a strong child. From a young age, she felt a
sense of responsibility as the next queen of the Demon Kingdom.  
Being involved in the dispelling of the seal, which was the consensus of
the Demon Kingdom, also made Susano happy.  
Moreover, the companion was 'Aoi', whom she had been hearing about from
her mother for a long time. Susano had admired Aoi since she was a
child.  
According to Dustis, she is "beautiful, cheerful, kind, and above all,
strong." Being able to act with such an Aoi was like a dream come true
for Susano.  
  
" Lady Aoi, thank you for offering to accompany us!"  
  
Aoi stopped Susano, who greeted her cheerfully.  
  
"Hold on, hold on. Let's stop with the 'Lady Aoi.' There are other ways
to call me, like just Aoi, right? Also, no titles!"  
"Yes! Then I'll call you *'Aoi'* !" (TN: Aoi-chan)  
  
Aoi and Hisui found Susano's honest answer endearing.  
  
(Aoi, huh... I said it, so... well, whatever...)  
  
"Hisui, nice to meet you too!" (TN: Hisui-chan)  
"Yes, nice to meet you too."  
  
Aoi and Hisui were surprised by something: the amount of magicules that
Susano possessed.  
  
(She might have more than me. That's an incredible amount of
magicules... And like Dustis, she's skilled at controlling them...)  
  
Hisui felt the same way.  
  
(This child might completely change the future of the Demon
Kingdom...)  
  
"Susano, can you use dark magic?"  
"I can't do anything too difficult..."  
"Okay. Then, until we depart for the first seal, I'll teach you various
things."  
"Yay! I'm so happy! Thank you, Aoi."  
  
Hisui narrowed her eyes as she looked at Susano, who was rejoicing
innocently.  
  
"Will you teach me too, Hisui?"  
"Eh? But is there anything I can teach you...? I know! I'll make a magic
sword for Susano! I'll have Aoi do the engraving!"  
"Oh, that's a good idea! Susano, Hisui's magicule control is amazing."  
"Really? A magic sword made by the two of you... Ah, it must be amazing.
I'm so happy."  
  
Susano jumped up and down with joy.  
  
"Well, please wait without expecting too much."  
  
Hisui thought of making a short dagger for Susano, who was still
small.  
  
"I'll ask Aoi to add durability and sharpness with a light engraving,
and enable gravity control with a dark engraving. How about a sword
whose weight can be changed by controlling magicules?"  
"Ehh, make one for me too!!"  
"Aoi already has Lord Jinrai's magnificent sword and a cursed sword,
doesn't she? I'll consider it if you give me Nijimaru."  
  
Susano chuckled.  
  
"Aoi and Hisui get along well!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui looked at each other.  
  
"Yes! We're very good friends!"  
  
Susano thought that the two of them had a very good relationship.
