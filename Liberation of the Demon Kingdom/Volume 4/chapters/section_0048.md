# Chapter 133: Ancient Weapons

"I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! I'll kill
you, I'll kill you in the worst way possible!!!"  
  
Vegas' screams echoed through the Bizes lord's mansion. Inside the
mansion, many corpses were piled up. These corpses weren't normal; they
were brutally chopped up, no longer resembling human forms.  
  
Vegas held a magic sword in his right hand, but it wasn't a dark magic
sword; it was a longsword with a wind seal engraved on it, passed down
from ancient times. Vegas' left shoulder was gouged out, and the arm was
missing.  
  
"Hisui!! My left arm is throbbing!! My wounds will never heal unless I
cut you to pieces!!"  
  
He was insane. Vegas' madness swirled around him.

Bizes territory. This territory, including the Sugal Plains, was very
important to Buenos. Buenos had heard about it from his master Luke, but
he couldn't believe it until he saw it with his own eyes.  
Ancient ruins. Beneath the Sugal Plains were traces of a civilization
that flourished long before the Magic Kingdom. This abnormally advanced
civilization was destroyed at some point. The reason why is unknown to
anyone.  
Although the reason is unknown, this civilization left two technologies
for the future. Or rather, it left them behind.  
One is "dark magicules". Yes, dark magicules were an artificially
created technology in ancient times. Its power surpassed other attribute
magic and even exceeded the realm of the gods.  
And the other was right in front of Buenos' eyes. This giant creature,
modeled after an ancient god, was called a Demon God. An ancient weapon
with extremely strong power.  
Buenos knew that Luke had placed a curse on the Demon Kingdom to seal
the Demon God. Now that Luke was gone, Buenos released the power of this
Demon God, using the power of Susano's sister, Sheema. However, the
Demon God could not exert its original power because Luke's seal was too
strong. At this moment, six of these seals had been broken. It was only
a matter of time before the seal within Aoi was lifted.  
After Aoi died and the seal was broken, Buenos would use the Demon
Capital's engraved circle to obtain dark magicules, "fuse with the Demon
God", and obtain the world.  
  
"Luke is dead, and no one knows the meaning of the seal Luke placed.
Luke lost because he only revealed the secret of these ruins to me."  
  
Buenos grinned eerily. As if responding to that smile, the Demon God
also let out an eerie groan.  
  
"I see. You want to merge with me soon, too..."  
  
Buenos was preparing the Order of Chaos' army in the Bizes territory.
Using children kidnapped from the great forest, he created cursed swords
and magic beasts, creating a dangerous army. Sheema was also used in
these preparations.  
Where was Sheema's will? Sheema's consciousness was reaped by Buenos
after Luke's death and sealed with the power of Magicule Eater and
Corruption Poison.  
After Luke's death, Sheema was exploited as a source of dark magicules,
and those magicules was running low. In particular, Sheema had poured an
enormous amount of magicules into summoning the Demon God.  
  
"Sheema is no longer usable either. To activate the engraving circle, I
have no choice but to use Hisui or Sheema's sister. But before that,
I'll have Sheema do one more job. Let's recreate the Sugal Plains!"  
  
Buenos cut the magical chains that bound the Demon God and grinned
eerily.  
  
"Attack the Demon Capital. When Aoi dies, the seal on the engraving
circle is broken, and we will seize the Demon Capital before the circle
is destroyed."
