# Chapter 108: Another Aoi

"Lady Aoi, is that high elf really a high elf?"  
  
Morse came to Aoi in the morning, looking gloomy.  
  
"Her magicule control is terrible. She is very capable of using wind,
enhancing her body, and being stealthy, but..."  
"Ah, Mao is a musclehead... The first time I met her, she didn't use any
real magic and attacked me with incredible speed. That was pretty
amazing."  
"If Lady Aoi says so, then it must be really amazing."  
  
Mao was shrinking behind Morse.  
  
"Were you able to learn spatial transfer magic?"  
"That is..."  
  
Mao said that and began to infuse magicules into her right hand. The
space cracked, and Mao thrust her right hand into the crack.  
  
"Oh!"  
  
Mao's hand popped out of the space right next to Aoi.  
  
"U, u. My arm is all I can manage. The distance is 10 meters..."  
  
Hisui was comforting Mao, who looked like she was about to cry. Morse
used spatial transfer magic to take out a short magic sword from the
crack in space.  
  
"Well, you may be bad at it, but you are my first disciple. I'll give
you this as proof of your graduation. It's a dagger with a wind
engraving from ancient times. It seems like it would be good for you to
use."  
"U, u. Thank you..."  
  
Later, Hisui's eyes were sparkling.  
  
"This sword seems to be even older than the Magic Kingdom era. I feel a
very strong power. Mao, can I look at it, no, touch it, no, no, rub my
cheek against it?"  
"U, u, u. Please..."  
  
Hisui took the dagger from Mao and happily picked it up and began to
caress it. Aoi stared at Hisui in amazement.  
  
—  
  
It was five days later that Aoi and the others arrived in the Demon
City. The group was immediately led by Dustis to a private room.  
  
"Dustis, I'm back."  
"Everyone, welcome back. It seems you have lifted the fifth seal... How
was it?"  
  
Aoi told Dustis what she had heard from Morse.  
  
"I see... Aoi, Miss Hisui. I'll guide you to the deepest part of this
castle later."  
  
Then Dustis looked around at everyone.  
  
"Everyone, thank you for your hard work. I feel the same way as you all.
I will do my best to remove the remaining seals from now on.  
Also, the defense of the Demon City! I won't let the Order of Chaos
interfere until the engraved circle is destroyed. I intend to ask the
Asura Kingdom to cooperate in lifting the seals.  
Aoi, you and Miss Hisui, I would like α Squad to lift the 6th and 7th
seals. Let me know if you need anything."  
  
Everyone was inspired by Dustis' words.  
  
—  
  
Aoi, Hisui, and Mao were being led by Dustis to the deepest part of the
castle. Perhaps because the fifth seal had been lifted, Aoi felt an
indescribable sense of unease.  
  
"Aoi looks anxious..."  
  
Aoi nodded.  
  
"I've never been to where we're going next either. It's said to be a
relic from the Magic Kingdom era.  
'Thou shalt not enter. Thou shalt not look. Thou shalt not touch. Great
calamity shall befall those who break this taboo.'  
That is the secret text that has been passed down."  
  
Dustis gestured to a stone door in the basement.  
  
"It's here."  
"How do we open it?"  
"Just cut it off. Aoi can do it, right?"  
  
Aoi nodded and infused magicules into Dark Cutter. Then she condensed
dark magicules into the blade and concentrated her mind and slashed at
the door. The door was cleanly split in two.  
  
"I always got along with Anna, but you're scary..."  
  
Mao was shaking her head violently in agreement next to her.  
  
"Don't talk about people like they're monsters. Come on, let's take a
look inside."  
  
Inside the door was a complex engraving that overlapped many times, and
a transparent coffin was placed in the center.  
The area was covered in a thick layer of dark magicules. Aoi noticed
that a presence similar to her own was drifting from the coffin.  
As if drawn to it, she walked towards the coffin.  
  
""Aoi...""  
  
Inside lay a woman with the same face as Aoi.  
  
"This person is me..."  
  
Aoi muttered as she touched the coffin.  
  
"This *'me'*  also wants to be released... She’s been lonely for a long
time..."  
  
Hisui quietly stood next to Aoi and peered into the coffin.  
  
"She looks sad..."  
"Yes, really... Dustis. Is the Order aiming for this place?"  
"Yes. I think so."  
  
Aoi thought for a moment and said.  
  
"Can we get in here with spatial transfer magic?"  
"What do you think...?"  
  
Mao was flustered by everyone's attention.  
  
"I, I can't do it!"  
"There's someone in the Order who can use spatial transfer magic. I
wonder if we can ask Anna for her cooperation... She's not good at this
kind of magic."  
  
Defending the deepest part of this castle from the Order is the key to
the liberation of the Demon Kingdom. The preparations for that must be
perfect.  
  
"It would be impossible for Anna. There are ties between the Asura
Kingdom and the Demon Kingdom as well..."  
  
Aoi suddenly thought of one person.  
  
"Let's ask Morse. Dustis, is it okay if the basement here becomes a
haunted house??"
