# Chapter 125: Space Transfer Magic and Rail Cannon

The entire α Squad held their breath. Everyone anticipated Mao being
skewered by the stinger. However, Mao had predicted this attack. The
moment the poison needle was fired, she activated spatial transfer magic
in its path. The needle plunged into the hole opened in space and
emerged from behind the Killer Bee, piercing its head.  
  
"Phew..."  
  
Mao breathed a sigh of relief after confirming the Killer Bee's
demise.  
  
"Mao, amazing! I've never seen anyone fight like that using spatial
transfer magic..."  
"Well, my reaction speed is fast. But it was my first time trying it, so
I was a little nervous."  
  
The α Squad members, including Hisui, were dumbfounded by Mao's
reaction.  
  
"Mao, I'm impressed. As a fellow wind user, I respect you."  
  
Luca's words were echoed by the other members.  
  
"I'm really amazed! Squad Leader Mao, your battle sense is
incredible!"  
  
Mao pretended to be calm, but her long ears twitched. Every time the α
Squad members praised her , Mao glanced at Aoi.  
  
(Miss Aoi, smug, smug!)  
  
She looked like a puppy waiting to be praised. Aoi smiled and ruffled
Mao's head vigorously.  
  
"Mao! Amazing! You did great!"  
"Hehehe."  
  
Mao grinned with a sloppy look on her face.  
  
"Mao, I'm sorry. I should have attacked the Killer Bee's abdomen.
Mikazuchi knew it..."  
"Hisui, it can't be helped. Those bees are common in the Great Forest
and the Demon Continent, but not in the Mars territory, right?"  
"That's true, but..."  
"Besides, thanks to that, I got praised by Aoi!"  
  
Mao gave Hisui a triumphant look with all her might.  
  
"Ouch, ouch. Hisui, that hurts!"  
  
Hisui couldn't help but pinch Mao's cheek.  
  
"Oh, I'm sorry. I pinched you without thinking."  
"Hisui, that's mean..."  
"Okay, no more flirting, let's move on."  
  
The Killer Bee had appeared in the middle level of the dungeon.  
  
"There are three more left."  
  
Luca urged everyone to be cautious.  
  
"Yeah, let's stay focused."  
  
With Aoi and Luca leading the way, the group descended further into the
dungeon.  
  
"This is the lowest level."  
  
At the bottom there was a room with a large door.  
  
"There are three inside. One is very large."  
  
Aoi nodded at Luca's words.  
  
"Alright. Everyone, are you ready?"  
  
Everyone nodded.  
  
"Mao and I will take the lead. Here we go."  
  
At Aoi's signal, Hisui sent a mini-lem crashing into the door. The door
burst open from the mini-lem's impact. Inside was a room about 30 meters
square and 20 meters high. A sealed stone monument could be seen in the
back.  
Inside was a large centipede monster. Its legs were sharp, like
swords.  
  
"Where are the other two?"  
"I don't know! I can't find them!"  
  
Luca replied sharply. The giant centipede swung its leg and attacked.
The slow Zilberk was targeted. He was caught by the giant centipede's
leg and sent flying to the ceiling.  
  
"Zilberk!"  
  
Mao used wind magic to catch Zilberk. Zilberk was unharmed.  
  
"Zilberk! I'm glad! You're tough!"  
  
Aoi used Nijimaru to cut off several of the giant centipede's legs.
Hisui also imitated Aoi and cut off the giant centipede's legs with
Yagiri. Mikazuchi and Force tried to attack with magic, but they
couldn't hurt the giant centipede due to its high magic resistance.  
  
"Physical attacks seem to be effective! Everyone, fall back! I'm going
to fire the rail cannon!"  
"Eh, Hisui! Here?"  
"I'll reduce the power!"  
"Okay! Leave the cleanup to me!"  
  
Hisui aimed the rail cannon at the giant centipede.  
  
"Go!"  
  
The rail cannon fired a projectile with a crackling sound. Five layers
of engraved magic were deployed on the barrel, accelerating the bullet.
The fired bullet rotated and struck the giant centipede's head with
overwhelming physical energy. At the same time, Aoi deployed
high-gravity magic at the point of impact to prevent it from
scattering.  
When Aoi released the gravity field, the giant centipede's head was
destroyed, and it no longer moved.  
  
"Luca! Any other reactions?"  
"They're in this room! But I can't find them!"  
"Everyone, stand back to back."  
  
Aoi waited. For the bloodlust to move. Everyone was tense. Sweat dripped
from Hisui's forehead.
