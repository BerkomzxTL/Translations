# Chapter 101: Into the Tower

"Miss Aoi, Hisui. Are you alright?"  
  
Mao, accompanied by α Squad and Susano, came to Aoi and Hisui, who were
sitting on the ground.  
  
"That was amazing magic. I was so surprised."  
"Really! Aoi. I was surprised too!"  
"Mao, what about the golems?"  
"Yeah, there aren't any more golems moving."  
"I see. Good work."  
  
With that, Aoi lay down on the ground.  
  
"Miss Aoi, can you heal?"  
"No, that might be a bit difficult?"  
  
Mao gave Force a look, and Force knelt beside Aoi.  
  
"Commander, excuse me."  
  
Force began to heal Aoi.  
  
"Thank you."  
"Commander, your amount of magicules is enormous. One healing isn't
enough..."  
"No, it's okay. If you do this much, I can heal myself afterward."  
  
Hisui reacted to those words.  
  
"That's it!! Aoi's * 'I'm okay'* ! I don't trust it at all! Force,
please heal her a few more times."  
  
Aoi tried to say something, but Hisui glared at her and she fell
silent.  
  
"..."  
"Hisui, I'll gather the knights and the mercenary corps here. Miss Aoi,
you're going to undo the seal once you can move, right?"  
"That's right. That's right. Mao, can you do that for me?"  
"Yeah, got it. Just wait a bit."  
"Force, can you give the signal?"  
  
Force shot a burst of light magic into the sky.  
  
"We'll go talk to the knights."  
  
Mao left Force and Luca there and walked towards the other α Squad
members and the knights.  
  
"Aoi, was that magic gravity manipulation?"  
"Yeah. It's magic that creates super-gravity, crushes things, and throws
them into subspace."  
"Alright! I'll try it next time!"  
  
Hearing Susano's words, Luca whispered to Hisui.  
  
"Princess Susano pulverized two golems with dark magic. And then
squished them with gravity magic."  
"Is that so... Squished them..."  
  
Watching Aoi and Susano talking so cheerfully, Hisui suddenly felt
uneasy.  
  
"You two! Reckless magic puts a strain on your bodies! Don't use it too
much!"  
  
And she stared at Aoi.  
  
"Especially Aoi! What was that magic? You don't need to throw things
into subspace. How much magicules did you use opening a hole in
space!"  
"Yes, I got carried away."  
"It's your own body, so please take care of it."  
  
Aoi, not understanding at all, asked Hisui tentatively.  
  
"Um, Miss Hisui. Now that I can move around, I'd like to see inside the
tower..."  
"No way! We'll wait for the knights and the mercenary corps to arrive
and prepare completely! Don't move until then!"  
"Yes... I'll be a good girl..."  
  
Seeing Force's signal, the mercenary corps gradually began to gather.  
  
—  
  
The mercenary corps, having joined up with the knights led by Shurak,
set up camp around the tower and waited.  
  
"Shurak, let's go inside the tower. We'll undo the seal."  
"Yes, Miss Aoi. Let's select the members. Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui, Miss
Mao, Susano, and myself. If something happens to us, Mikazuchi will take
command of the mercenary corps, and Vice Commander Mouri will take
command of the knights. Is that okay?"  
"Yeah, let's do that. Are you ready to enter the tower?"  
  
Each person carried two days' worth of food and water.  
  
"Alright, let's go. Though I think we can reach the seal location in
about two hours."  
  
The five of them moved to the tower in a line.  
Numerous destroyed golems were littered around. And the right arm of the
giant golem was stuck in the ground near the entrance of the tower.  
  
"I still can't believe it. That you guys defeated that golem..."  
  
Mao muttered as she looked up at the giant golem's right arm.  
  
"If Miss Aoi was serious in the Great Forest, I would have been
dead..."  
  
Aoi was tilting her head in front of the tower's door.  
  
"What's wrong?"  
"Well, the *'words'*  to open the door that I heard from Luke aren't
working. The giant golem didn't exist before either... It's
changed..."  
"Could it be the work of the Order of Chaos?"  
"No, this magic is definitely Luke's."  
  
Aoi thought for a moment but immediately raised her face.  
  
"I'm going to destroy the door. Everyone, stand back."  
  
Aoi poured magicules into Nijimaru and released a blade of light.  
  
"!"  
  
However, the magic was deflected by the door and disappeared. Next, Aoi
drew Dark Cutter. And after pouring magicules into it, she slammed it
into the door. This time, the door was cleanly split in two, and an
entrance to the tower opened wide.  
  
"It wouldn't cut unless I infused it with dark magicules..."  
  
Aoi returned Dark Cutter to its sheath.  
  
"Alright, let's go."
