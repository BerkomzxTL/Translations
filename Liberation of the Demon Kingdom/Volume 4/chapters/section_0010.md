# Chapter 95: Aoi's Tears

Hisui was gazing at the cityscape of the Demon Kingdom from the castle
rooftop with Mao.  
  
"Aoi always tries to do reckless things when it comes to the Demon God
of Chaos."  
  
Mao understood Hisui's sorrow well. The person she wanted to support
went off somewhere on her own... Nothing is as empty as that.  
  
"Hisui, I want to be of help to Miss Aoi too. And you know, Miss Aoi is
properly relying on you."  
"Do you think so?"  
"Yes, she is."  
"Mao, thank you. You were worried about me, weren't you?"  
  
Hisui looked at Mao, then returned her gaze to the cityscape and said.  
  
"Of course, I was. I'm Hisui's friend, after all... Oh, Hisui, Miss Aoi
is here. I'll hide, so make up properly."  
  
With those words, Mao cut off her presence and hid.  
Soon after, Aoi opened the door and came onto the rooftop.  
  
"Hisui, I've been looking for you..."  
  
Hisui turned to look at Aoi but immediately returned her gaze to the
cityscape.  
  
"Hisui, Dustis scolded me too."  
  
Aoi slowly approached Hisui and stood next to her. Hisui didn't look at
Aoi but asked her.  
  
"Compared to the Asura Kingdom, it's a sad sight. There are many people
who have to live difficult lives because of the dense concentration of
magicules. Purifying these magicules must be the wish of everyone in
this kingdom.  
It's not something Aoi has to shoulder alone. The same goes for Sheema.
The use of dark magic in the Sugal Plains isn't the responsibility of
Sheema's mother, Miss Dustis, is it?"  
  
Aoi couldn't say anything as she looked at Hisui, who was speaking
quietly.  
  
"Half of Aoi's suffering is mine. Why won't you say *'together'*  or
*'lend me your strength'* ?"  
"Thank you... Thank you, Hisui."  
  
Tears streamed down Aoi's cheeks.  
  
"Hisui, I want you to lend me your strength to liberate the Demon
Kingdom together..."  
"This is the first time I've seen Aoi cry."  
  
Hisui faced Aoi and took her hand.  
  
"Yes, let's combine our strengths together."  
"Ah, Mao saw my embarrassing side too."  
"Eh, Aoi. You noticed Mao?"  
"I made Mao worry too! It's okay now. Mao, thank you for being by
Hisui's side!"  
  
Mao was smiling alone in the shadow of the stairs leading to the
rooftop.  
  
—  
  
"Alright, from now on, we'll form two special squads! These two squads
are granted the authority to command other squads, and are permitted to
act independently in times of emergency."  
  
Three days after Aoi became commander, she gathered the mercenary corps
during training and announced.  
The members of the mercenary corps buzzed. The treatment of the special
squads was exceptional.  
  
"Now, for α Squad,  
Squad Leader: Mao (High Elf, Wind User)  
Vice Squad Leader: Mikazuchi (Ogre, Fire User)  
Member: Force (Human, Light User)  
Member: Zilberk (Dwarf, Earth User)  
Member: Luca (Wind User, Elf)"  
  
In α Squad, Mao and Luca were women. Aoi had spoken to the squad
members, starting with Vice Squad Leader Mikazuchi, beforehand.
Regarding Mao becoming the Squad Leader, the members respected Mao's
abilities and immediately accepted Mao as the Squad Leader.  
  
(To move with such flawless skill, yet to not sense her presence at all.
There's no way we could win...)  
  
This was the reaction of the α Squad members when Mao was first
introduced.  
  
"Next, for β Squad,  
Squad Leader: Bardock (Dark Elf, Light User)  
Vice Squad Leader: Namul (Elf, Wind User)  
Member: Ober (Human, Light User)  
Member: Zun (Ogre, Earth User)  
Member: Hanna (Elf, Wind User)"  
  
In β Squad, Hanna was a woman. It was a form of promoting Bardock's
squad as is.  
  
"Sis, thank you very much! I'll do my best for you!"  
"Yeah, I'm counting on you, Bardock."
