# Chapter 142: Liberation of the Demon Kingdom

When white flowers of light bloomed in the blue sky, the Asura Knights
had finished exterminating the magical beasts.  
Tsukumi felt that the cursed energy had been purified. Tsukumi called
out to Amano, who was looking at the sky in the same way beside her.  
  
"That's good."  
"After a 500-year curse has been lifted, all you have to say is that,
Tsukumi?"  
"Yes, I have no other words."  
  
Amano nodded and muttered.  
  
"That's right. No other words are needed..."  
  
—  
  
Sheema had the dark magic cast on her by Buenos dispelled by Aoi. The
consciousness that had been closed off returned to Sheema.  
  
"Sheema, are you alright?"  
  
Aoi slowly spoke to Sheema.  
  
"Ah, Miss Aoi, is it..."  
  
Sheema responded to Aoi's words.  
  
"Oh, you know me?"  
"Yes, I've heard a lot about Miss Aoi from Lord Luke. You are just as I
imagined..."  
  
Sheema remembered being taken away by Luke. After that, she was raised
carefully by Luke and learned to control magicules.  
Then Sheema began to talk about what had happened little by little.  
  
"I was the one who laid the sealing circle in the Sugal Plains. By that
time, Lord Luke had used up almost all of his magicules to seal the
Demon God."  
  
Luke must have been strengthening the Demon God's seal by using more
magicules than he could handle. But even then, the Demon God's seal was
not sufficient. Aoi felt like she saw Luke's suffering from Sheema's
story. It must not have been Luke's intention to burden Sheema for the
sake of the Demon God's seal.  
However, Luke forced this burden on the girl. After Luke's death, her
consciousness was hunted by Buenos, and she was drained of magicules to
create many cursed swords and magical beasts, and to dispel the Demon
God's seal.  
  
"I don't think I can use magic anymore."  
  
Indeed, Sheema had fallen into a state of magicule depletion by using
more magicules than she could handle. Just like Aoi three years ago.  
  
"You've suffered in my place."  
  
Sheema shook her head at Aoi's words.  
  
"No, I received love from Lord Luke for your share as well..."  
  
Aoi gently hugged Sheema.  
  
"Sheema, Dustis and Shurak are waiting."  
"Yes."  
"Sister, welcome home."  
"Susano, I'm home."  
  
The sisters smiled at each other. Tears were overflowing from their
eyes.  
  
—  
  
"That was good, Aoi."  
  
Hisui, who had released her Dragon Armament, stood next to Aoi.  
  
"Yeah, I wonder if it turned out the way Luke wanted?"  
"I'm sure Mr. Luke is happy."  
"Do you think so?"  
"Yes, I think so."  
  
Hisui looked into Aoi's face and asked.  
  
"What are you going to do now, Aoi?"  
"I wonder. I promised Susano. If Susano becomes the Demon Queen, I want
to assist her."  
"That's right. I promised too. Half of Aoi's suffering is mine, too!"  
  
Hisui's answer was very pleasing to Aoi.  
  
"Alright, partner! I look forward to working with you from now on!"  
  
The sky of the Demon Kingdom was crystal clear and blue as far as the
eye could see.  
  
—  
  
Vegas struggled. He was trying to support his body as it sank deeper and
deeper into the bottom of the earth.  
  
"Hisui! I won't forgive you!"  
  
Vegas' hatred was abnormal. And that strong, dark hatred summoned
something from beyond this world.  
  
'Seek power! Then I will bestow it!'  
  
Vegas answered the voice that echoed in his head.  
  
"Give it to me! Give it all to me!"  
  
At that moment, Vegas felt something evil enter his body.  
  
"Fuhahahaha, not yet! Hisui!!"  
  
Vegas' consciousness sank back into the depths of darkness. Embracing
the power of darkness within him...
