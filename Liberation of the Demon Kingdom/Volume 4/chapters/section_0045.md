# Chapter 130: Aoi and the Curse

"That physical attack was splendid, Hisui."  
  
Buenos glanced at Hisui.  
  
"That attack rendered my disciple Vegas incapacitated. The plan is
slightly off, but there should be no problem."  
  
As Buenos said this, he swung the cursed sword, Corruption Poison, in
his left hand. A huge amount of magicules released from the cursed sword
became a demonic aura, robbing Hisui and Luca of their freedom.  
  
"This is the perfect opportunity to neutralize Aoi."  
"Guh, Buenos!!"  
"Aoi, you are a nuisance. Don't worry. I'm just sealing your magic. I'll
keep Hisui alive until the Demon City conversion circle is activated.
But the other one will have to die."  
  
Buenos said this and unleashed a huge explosion magic at Luca.  
  
"Stop!! Buenos!!!"  
  
Aoi released the resist spell. The magicules of the engraved circle
became a curse and corroded Aoi's body. However,  
  
"Buenos!!"  
  
Aoi put all her spirit into it and unleashed dark magic at Buenos. It
was a powerful magic that could erase the existence of matter just by
touching it.  
Aoi's dark magic extinguished Buenos' explosion magic and attacked
Buenos.  
  
"!!"  
  
Buenos tried to ward off Aoi's dark magic with Magicule Eater in his
right hand and Corruption Poison in his left hand.  
  
"Kuh!"  
  
Buenos defended against Aoi's dark magic, but cracks appeared in the
blade of Corruption Poison. At the same time, the demonic aura that
bound Hisui and Luca dissipated.  
  
"Buenos!! You!!"  
  
Hisui put her rage into a slash and fired it at Buenos on Yagiri. Buenos
could not avoid this slash from the upper level. Buenos received Hisui's
slash with Corruption Poison.  
  
\*Crack\*  
  
The blade of Corruption Poison, which had received Hisui's slash, was
broken from its base.  
  
"So it’s come to this! However, Aoi will not be able to use magic for a
while. The seal seems to have been transferred to Aoi. I'll withdraw
before Vegas runs out of magicules."  
  
Buenos turned around and threw himself into a spatial rift.  
  
"Wait! Buenos!!"  
  
Hisui loaded magicules into the rail cannon and fired it at Buenos'
back, but she didn't feel any response. The spatial rift closed.  
  
"Aoi!!"  
  
Hisui ran to Aoi's side.  
Aoi's Dragon Armament was dispelled, and she was limp in Luca's arms.  
  
"Miss Aoi is breathing! Quick, Force, heal her! I'll carry her!"  
  
Luca carried Aoi on her back and ran towards the exit of the tower.
Hisui followed Luca, still holding Yagiri.  
  
"It's my fault. For saving me! This happened. Miss Aoi! Please stay
alive!"  
  
Luca's shout echoed inside the tower.  
  
—  
  
"Force! Please heal her!!"  
  
At the entrance of the tower, the members of α squad were waiting for
Aoi and the others to return.  
  
"Hisui! What happened? Miss Aoi!!"  
  
Aoi did not respond to Mao's call. Force knelt beside Aoi and began to
heal her. She didn't wake up. He healed her. She didn't wake up.
Healing...  
How many times had he healed her? Aoi's eyes opened slightly.  
  
"Aoi. Can you understand?"  
  
Aoi nodded slightly to Hisui's question.  
  
"That's good... Let's rest for a while. Luca, please be vigilant around
the area."  
"Yes, Miss Hisui."  
"Mao, could you patrol around here? There's no guarantee that there's
something that Luca can't detect..."  
"Understood. Mikazuchi, Zilberk. Come with me."  
  
Mao and the others immediately stood up and walked towards the lake.  
  
"Force, thank you. Are you out of magicules?"  
"No, I can heal her a little more."  
"Please. Also, was there any movement from the Order while we were in
the tower?"  
  
Force answered while healing.  
  
"Eight people were hiding, but Squad Leader Mao took care of them
all."  
  
Hisui nodded greatly.  
  
"Aoi..."  
  
Aoi didn't answer Hisui's call anymore.  
Hisui quickly decided to retreat to the Demon City.
