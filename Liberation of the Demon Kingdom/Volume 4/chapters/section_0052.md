# Chapter 137: Each Battlefield

"Target that golem! Take it down no matter what!"  
  
The Order's soldiers focused their magic on the three golems. Even the
golems were taking a beating from the numerous magic attacks, their
armor becoming tattered. An ice spear from water magic shattered the leg
of one golem. The golem collapsed.  
  
"Not yet!"  
  
Zilberk sent the remaining golems charging forward. The two golems,
while taking magic attacks, still managed to send several magic users
flying.  
  
"Have those guys retreated yet?"  
  
Zilberk looked back.  
  
"Good. Looks like they were able to retreat."  
  
Zilberk commanded the golems to charge into the area teeming with
magical beasts.  
  
"Get out of the way if you don't want to die!"  
  
Magic concentrated, and one golem fell. Even so, Zilberk didn't stop.
The other golem also had its leg destroyed by a single blow from an
ogre's club. Even so, Zilberk didn't stop.  
He skewered several wolf-type magical beasts with earth magic. But…  
  
"My leg is done for…"  
  
An ice spear was impaled in Zilberk's left leg.  
  
"Is this it…"  
  
Just as Zilberk was about to unleash one last spell, he saw the figure
of a war god.  
  
"Vice Commander Hisui!"  
  
Zilberk felt like he was in a dream as he saw Hisui, clad in Dragon
Armament and carrying Luca on her shoulder, heading towards him.  
  
"Is this a dream?"  
  
Hisui's figure was as divine as a God of War, emitting an overwhelming
aura.  
Hisui took aim with her rail cannon and fired. The bullet mowed down
Order soldiers and magical beasts before exploding and scattering.  
  
"That's the rail cannon I made with Vice Commander Hisui! Amazing, isn't
it!!!"  
  
Zilberk shouted excitedly.  
  
"Zilberk!"  
  
Hisui was angry. That anger was directed at herself, but Zilberk was
intimidated by Hisui's anger.  
  
"Zilberk! I hate people who don't value their lives! But thank you.
Thanks to Zilberk, many lives were saved."  
  
Hisui drew her Yagiri and defeated the remaining Order soldiers. Before
he knew it, Luca was standing next to Zilberk.  
  
"Zilberk, I'm glad we made it in time."  
"Yeah, but the golems were destroyed."  
"I'm glad you're safe."  
"Yeah…"  
  
Hisui was strong. She wielded the Dragon Armament like her own limbs,
defeating Order soldiers and magical beasts. The Order soldiers were
flustered. They were terrified of Hisui, who was like a war god.  
  
"U-uwaa"  
  
The soldiers began to flee. Hisui did not pursue the retreating
soldiers. And she turned her Yagiri towards a strong presence that was
approaching. But, what was there was….  
  
"Hisui!!"  
"You guys…"  
  
Hisui looked a little relieved, but when she noticed Mikazuchi carrying
Aoi on his back, she rushed over.  
  
"Hisui, Marsim brought Miss Aoi."  
"Miss Hisui, Miss Aoi lost consciousness after dispelling the
large-scale dark magic. But before that, she asked to be taken to Miss
Hisui… I…"  
"Hisui, Marsim did her best."  
  
Hisui nodded firmly when she saw Marsim. Then Hisui went to Aoi's side
and took her hand.  
  
"So, it was Aoi who dispelled the dark magic…"  
"Miss Hisui, Miss Aoi hasn't regained consciousness…"  
  
Hisui slowly spoke to Aoi.  
  
"Aoi…, everyone is doing their best. Please praise us like you always
do, *'Good job, you did well'* …. Aoi, wake up…"  
  
It was a faint voice. But it had a strong power that shook Hisui and the
others' hearts.  
  
"Good job. Everyone. You did well."  
"Aoi!! You're awake?? Aoi,"  
"Marsim. Thank you. You fulfilled your promise."  
  
Tears streamed down Marsim's cheeks.  
  
"Hisui, Sheema is there. She’s suffering. I want to help her. But I feel
an ominous presence. That's why I want to borrow everyone's strength.
Can you help me?"  
  
Hisui nodded firmly. Mao, Marsim, and the members of α Squad as well.  
  
"Thank you. Everyone. Hisui, it's on that hill. Buenos is probably there
too."  
"Understood. Force! Mercenary corps, all units charge! If we take that
hill and defeat Buenos, this battle is won!"  
  
Force nodded and unleashed light magic into the sky. It blossomed
magnificently in the sky above the Demon City.
