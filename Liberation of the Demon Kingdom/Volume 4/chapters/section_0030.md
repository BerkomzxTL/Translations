# Chapter 115: Flame Dragon Flail

"Yes! There. Drop the ice."  
  
Mitsui's squad was having a very easy salamander hunt, simply casting
spells according to Luca's spatial recognition magic.  
  
(We've already crushed 6. What an amazing user...)  
  
Mitsui was shocked. The fact that the vice commander of the squad this
elf belonged to was Hisui also surprised Mitsui.  
  
(Miss Hisui is becoming more and more distant...)  
  
"Squad Leader Mitsui. It's time. I think it would be more efficient to
defeat them in close combat from now on. I'll help too."  
  
Luca said this to Mitsui and drew her rapier.  
  
(Ah, it looks like the sword Miss Hisui used to use.)  
  
Mitsui was lost in thought for a moment but immediately,  
  
"Everyone, draw your swords! Crush the salamanders!"  
  
He gave the order and approached the salamanders. The salamanders spat
flames and rampaged, but Luca resisted the flames approaching Mitsui and
the others.  
  
"Squad Leader Mitsui. Leave the defense to me."  
  
With Luca's accurate assistance, Mitsui and the others steadily defeated
the salamanders one by one. Before they knew it, there were no more
salamanders around Mitsui's squad.  
  
"The area is under our control.”  
  
Luca told Mitsui with a smile.  
  
"It looks like the Demon Kingdom side is finishing up too."  
  
When he turned his eyes to the eastern slope, there were several pillars
of ice standing there.  
  
"That's Queen Dustis' magic. She always uses beautiful magic..."  
"Miss Luca. Thank you. You were a great help. It was accurate
assistance. I respect your strength."  
  
Luca shook herhead slightly at Mitsui's words.  
  
"No, I am not even in the same league as Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui, or Squad
Leader Mao. I still have a lot to improve on..."  
  
Mitsui was shocked again by Luca's words.  
  
(That means I'm still not good enough!)  
  
Mitsui renewed his determination to at least become a Squad Leader that
Hisui would recognize.  
  
—  
  
"Now, I’ll summon the Flame Dragon Flail."  
  
Marsim was shocked by Aoi's declaration.  
  
(S, summoning magic?? She can even do that...)  
  
However, Hisui and Susano knew.  
  
"Hey, hey, Hisui. Is it that again?"  
"Yes, it must be that again."  
  
Hisui and Susano whispered to each other. And their prediction was
correct.  
  
"Oiii, Flail! If you don't want me to blast the tower with magic, show
yourself immediately!"  
  
Flail had noticed Aoi's presence several moments ago and was
terrified.  
  
(Is that Lady Aoi who defeated the Magic Dragon Jaswan! Why is she
here?)  
  
Flail could not forget the terror of that time.  
  
(She cut off Jaswan's head in one blow... That Jaswan!)  
  
Then came that call. Flail had no choice. He hurriedly took human form,
left the tower, and went to Aoi. He was a tall, muscular man of middle
age.  
  
"Slow!!"  
  
Hisui turned to Susano and said at Aoi's words.  
  
"I wonder if Aoi really was a bully...?"  
"Uoi. I can hear everything."  
"Lady Aoi. Flail has arrived."  
"Okay. Flail. I’ll undo the seal."  
  
Flail nodded greatly.  
  
"That is not something I can decide. As Lady Aoi wishes."  
"Okay. And then."  
  
Aoi paused and then told Flail.  
  
"You are now free! Is what I would like to say... but you will have to
become my servant."  
  
Flail was a little surprised by this. But the dragon race is originally
a society where the strong have power. Flail swallowed this too.  
  
"As you wish. What should I do?"  
  
Aoi applied the Dragon's Guidance to Flail and passed light magicules
through it. A mark was engraved on Flail's body by the Dragon's
Guidance.  
  
"Okay. Flame Dragon Flail. From now on, obey my orders as my, Aoi's,
servant."  
"Hahaha. Lady Aoi."  
  
Marsim was beyond shocked and about to faint.  
  
(A dragon... and she even has an ancient dragon as a servant... Did I
really pick a fight with this person…!)  
  
Marsim just stared at Aoi.
