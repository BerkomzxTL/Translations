# Chapter 98: Susano's Determination

From that day until the departure for the first seal, Susano was taught
dark magic by Aoi. Susano originally had a large amount of magicules and
had learned to control them from Dustis, so once she grasped the basics,
she improved rapidly.  
  
"Susano, all you need is to be able to imagine the magic.  
Dark magic can manipulate gravity, corrode, absorb, block senses,
manipulate dimensions, and if you can imagine it, even manipulate time.
Just watch."  
  
As soon as Aoi said that, she moved next to Hisui, who was about 3
meters away.  
  
"Just now, I stopped time and moved."  
"What?! Aoi, you can do that? You really can do anything..."  
  
Hisui sighed deeply.  
  
"Well, it's only for about 3 seconds, and I have to concentrate quite a
bit, so it's difficult to use in battle."  
  
Hisui shuddered as she imagined Aoi using time-stopping magic in
battle.  
  
"... ."  
"What is it?"  
  
Susano listened to their exchange while thinking, then said,  
  
"Aoi! Here I go!"  
  
Saying that, she moved instantaneously a distance of about 30cm.  
  
".... You two are out of the ordinary... Unbelievable..."  
"What are you talking about, Hisui! You create such extraordinary
golems! Susano, Hisui even hit a sky dragon flying in the sky with a
golem's arm and knocked it to the ground."  
  
Susano looked incredulous.  
  
"I don't want to hear that from someone who defeated a magic dragon!
More importantly, Susano's magicule control is amazing. You really
stopped time..."  
"Yeah, Susano can become a strong dark magic user. Alright, then, let's
teach you swordsmanship too."  
  
—  
  
"Toh!"  
  
Susano swung the training sword, but her hips were pulled back and she
was being swung around by the sword.  
  
(Could it be that Susano has poor motor skills...?)  
  
Hisui felt a twinge of anxiety.  
  
"Yeah, Susano doesn't have any talent for swordsmanship..."  
"I thought so... I'm not good at moving my body... Aoi and Hisui are so
good at moving though..."  
  
Aoi, seeing Susano dejected, suddenly lifted her up and gave her a
piggyback ride.  
  
"Susano is the next queen, so it's enough if you can use magic! When you
have to fight with a sword, Hisui and I will fight in your place."  
"Really? Does that mean that when I become queen, Aoi and Hisui will
stay by my side?"  
"Of course!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui's answers overlapped.  
  
"Will you also lend me your strength to develop the Demon Kingdom after
it’s liberated?"  
"That's right. If Susano is to be a good queen, Hisui and I will lend
you our strength with all our might. But if Susano becomes a queen who
oppresses the people, we’ll leave you."  
"Yes, I promise to turn the Demon Kingdom into a truly happy kingdom, a
prosperous kingdom!"  
  
Susano declared from Aoi's shoulders.  
  
In the future, Aoi and Hisui would be running around for Susano and the
Demon Kingdom, no, the prosperous kingdom, but that's a story for
another time.  
  
—  
  
"Alright, mercenary corps! Let's depart."  
  
The unit of 82 mercenaries led by Aoi and 102 knights led by Shurak
departed for the first seal.  
Aoi and Susano rode on the Gamou bird Kamo, and Hisui rode on Gamo.  
  
"How is it, Susano? Is it hard?"  
"No, Aoi. I'm okay."  
  
It was about a 3-day distance from the Demon Capital to the first seal.
The march was extremely smooth, and there was no interference from the
Order of Chaos, which had been a concern.  
  
"Aoi, isn't it creepy in a way?"  
  
Aoi and Hisui were a little worried about the lack of interference from
the Order of Chaos.  
The first seal is located in the center of the Horio Desert. Regarding
the desert march, the food supply was sufficient, and drinking water
could be supplied by water magic users, so the unit reached the first
seal as scheduled after 3 days without a single dropout.  
  
"That's the first seal."  
  
Aoi pointed to a tower that suddenly appeared in the desert.  
  
"It's not that big, is it?"  
"Hisui, but I can feel strong magicules."  
"Okay, Mao. Please set up the unit's encampment. Hisui and I will go
talk to Shurak."  
  
Aoi and Hisui left Susano and Mao and joined the knights.  
  
"Where's Shurak?"  
  
Aoi and Hisui, who had joined the knights, were led to Shurak's tent.  
  
"Shurak, it's finally time."  
"Yes, Miss Aoi."  
  
There was a desk in the tent with a map of the desert terrain spread out
on it.  
  
"Shurak, there are 200 golems here. They will attack if they cross this
position (line A). So, have the advance team cross this line to get the
golems to sortie.  
We’ve organized 10 teams of 1 wind magic user and 4 earth or water magic
users from the mercenary corps, so search for the golems from this
position while aiming at them with large masses of rock or ice."  
  
As Aoi said that, she drew a line B outside A.  
  
"If A is breached, stop the magic attack and engage in close combat with
80 knights and 30 mercenaries. So far so good?"  
"Yes, no problem. The knights and mercenaries will attack the golems
from the sides, right?"  
  
Aoi nodded vigorously.  
  
"There are only a few mercenaries, but is that okay?"  
"Yeah, Hisui will create three extremely strong golems. Don't
accidentally attack them."  
"Understood. It would be helpful if you could put some kind of mark on
them..."  
  
Hisui thought for a moment but answered immediately.  
  
"Shall I make it black?"  
"Oh, good idea. It sounds strong."  
"Understood. We will notify everyone not to attack the black golems."  
"Once all the golems are crushed, Hisui, Susano, Shurak, and I will lift
the seal inside the tower. First, let's go golem hunting!"
