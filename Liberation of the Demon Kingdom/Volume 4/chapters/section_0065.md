# Chapter 150: The Wind Brigade (4)

**Last chapter of After Story 1**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Hisui was struggling with a feeling of disgust. Right now, Aoi and Hisui
had their hands and feet bound, and were pinned to the wall.  
Especially Aoi, whose clothes were torn in some places, revealing her
underwear. However, if they moved carelessly here, it would ruin all of
Aoi's hard work. That thought made Hisui endure.  
Gamaliel, who appeared with Vice-Chief Musaba of the Wind Brigade and
several strong men, looked even more hideous up close. With a plump
physique, especially his stomach protruding greatly, Hisui worried that
he couldn't see his lower half.  
  
"Fufu, the more I look, the more beautiful... What a sensational
sight..."  
"Please stop! We are..."  
  
Cutting off Aoi's monotone remarks, Gamaliel took out a whip.  
  
"Miss. It doesn't matter whether you are spies or not. I'll have you
join my game."  
  
As the toad said, he suddenly swung his whip at Aoi. Hisui secretly
created a wall of iron with earth magic before it could hit Aoi,
protecting her from the whip.  
  
"Kyaa."  
  
Hisui was worried that her defense would be revealed by Aoi's forced
scream.  
  
"Good, good. Lord Musaba, what do you think?"  
  
Gamaliel handed the whip to Musaba. Musaba, holding the whip, couldn't
stop the murderous feelings from welling up inside him.  
  
"Hahaha, this is a good thing."  
  
Musaba whipped Hisui several times. Hisui defended with magic.  
  
"Ugh, please stop."  
  
It was Hisui's line, even more monotone than Aoi's, but Musaba, who was
excited, didn't notice.  
  
"Ah, y-you're from the Wind Brigade! Why are you doing this!"  
  
Gamaliel answered Aoi's question.  
  
"Ho. You're a well-informed young lady. Lord Musaba will be controlling
the Demon Capital branch of the Wind Brigade. We’re mutually supporting
each other and developing. Today is a pre-celebration of that. Please
enjoy yourselves."  
  
Gamaliel whipped at Aoi again. But,  
  
"Wh-what?"  
  
The tip of the whip Gamaliel swung was held by Aoi.  
  
"Yep, since I heard that, the service time is over. Everyone, behave!"  
  
Then Mao, carrying Celestial Yin and Yang and Yagiri, barged in.  
  
"Miss Aoi, Hisui! Sorry to keep you waiting!"  
  
Hisui also removed the shackles and received her sword from Mao.  
  
"You've made a fool of Aoi..."  
"No, no, Miss Hisui. I wasn't made a fool of..."  
  
Aoi's protest didn't reach Hisui's ears.  
  
"Divine punishment!!"  
  
Hisui infused magicules into Yagiri, transforming the blade into a whip,
and instantly blew away Gamaliel's guards.  
  
"Hihhie. You two, are you by any chance. The Free Knights!!"  
  
Aoi smiled slyly and pointed her sword at Gamaliel.  
  
"We have evidence of illegal transactions here."  
  
Mao waved the documents she was holding at Gamaliel. Gamaliel slumped to
his knees.  
  
"Now Gam! Leave Musaba to me."  
  
At Aoi's voice, Gam came into the room, leading the members of the Wind
Brigade.  
  
"Chief! Th-this is..."  
"Musaba, we know that you colluded with Gamaliel and conducted illegal
drug and human trafficking behind the scenes. We hereby expel you from
the Wind Brigade!"  
  
Musaba also slumped to his knees.  
The members of the Wind Brigade put ropes on Gamaliel and Musaba.  
  
"Hand them over to the military police!"  
  
At Gam's instruction, the two were led outside.  
  
"Miss Aoi, Miss Hisui. Thank you. We learned about Musaba's evil deeds
early."  
"Yep, we'll take down the Serpent Dragon Society. Jim, you'll also get
other organizations to collude and take control of the underworld,
okay?"  
"Yes, as Prime Minister Sheema's planned, we won't allow drugs and human
trafficking. Leave it to me!"  
  
And then Jim breathed a sigh.  
  
"Um, Miss Aoi. Your outfit is very sexy, so it would be better if you
hid it... Uha! Ha!!"  
  
Jim couldn't finish his words.  
Because he was wrapped up by Hisui's earth magic.  
  
"Shameless! Jim! What are you looking at! Reflect on your actions!"  
  
The members of the Wind Brigade were terrified at the sight.  
  
"The leader... being restrained without being able to do anything..."  
  
This incident left an impression on the members of the Wind Brigade
about the strength of Aoi and Hisui.  
  
—  
  
"Yes. Miss Mao, thank you for your hard work."  
  
Sheema had received a report from Mao that the Wind Brigade was
beginning to take over the underworld of the Demon Capital, although it
would take time to completely control it.  
  
"Crime is also decreasing little by little."  
  
Seeing Mao's happy expression, Sheema couldn't help but smile.  
  
"By the way, Miss Mao. I heard that there are many shops displaying
signed endorsements written by Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui..."  
"That's right. Miss Aoi and Hisui are drinking in the Demon Capital
every night... When I go to hang out after work, they're never
there..."  
  
Sheema also smiled wryly at Mao's lonely expression.  
  
"You should go with them..."  
"No way. I'm not good at drinking in that kind of place... I feel like
my chastity is in danger... so."  
"I-is that so..."  
  
While listening to Mao's story, Sheema was thinking.  
  
(Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui are protecting the Demon Capital during this
transitional period... We can't afford to cause a commotion in the shops
that Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui frequent...)  
  
—  
  
"Haha! What is this dish! It looks disgusting, but it's very
delicious!"  
"Aoi, it's really delicious. I'm glad I had the courage to try it."  
"Right! By the way, are you Miss Aoi and Miss Hisui?"  
  
Aoi and Hisui looked at each other.  
  
"That's right..."  
"I thought so! It's on the house! Drink and eat as much as you want. In
exchange..."  
  
Hisui kneaded magicules and created a sample of the ugly-looking dish
from a stone. And wrote on the autograph card, "It looks bad, but the
taste is the best! Aoi and Hisui".  
  
"Thank you very much! I'll treasure it!!"  
  
Looking at the happy shop owner, Aoi muttered.  
  
"I want to make this kingdom a place where everyone can have fun...
right, Hisui?"  
"Yes, that's right. Aoi."  
  
Hisui answered with a smile as she tilted her glass of ale.
