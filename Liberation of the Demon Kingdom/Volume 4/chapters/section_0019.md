# Chapter 104: Aoi's Anguish

That day, Aoi and Hisui decided to go out to a bar in the Demon Capital.
There were various circumstances to consider. However, the two did not
want to be constrained by them.  
  
"Let's drink today. Is it okay if we don't talk about the seal?"  
  
This was also desirable for Hisui. She didn't want to see Aoi with such
a stern face.  
  
"Yes. I want to have fun drinking today."  
  
Aoi and Hisui had come to Bardock's recommended tavern. It was a place
where you could taste the local cuisine of the Demon Kingdom.  
  
"Big brother, I'd like some Demon Kingdom food and alcohol, what do you
recommend?"  
"In that case, this stew is delicious. It's a dish of beef offal, meat,
tomatoes, and herbs stewed together. And for alcohol, this Demon
Kingdom's special distilled liquor! It also goes well with this chicken
seasoned with spices and garlic and grilled."  
"Okay, I'll have that!"  
"Okay, here you go! The alcohol and stew! The chicken will be a little
longer."  
  
Aoi and Hisui lightly clinked their glasses and began to sip the
distilled liquor made from unknown ingredients from the Demon Kingdom.  
  
"Hmm, it tastes delicious, but it also tastes bad, it's strange."  
"It really is. But you know, everything tastes delicious when I drink
with Hisui."  
"Hehehe, it's been a while since Aoi and I spent time together."  
  
After that, the two talked about various things. Their preferred types,
fun things they experienced during their travels, their childhoods, and
so on. It was the first time in a while that they had a good time.
However, their beauty made them stand out too much in this tavern.  
  
"Hehe, ladies. Let's drink together."  
  
These types of people are everywhere. Aoi glanced at these guys.  
  
"I'm the commander of the Demon Kingdom mercenary corps. You'll get hurt
if you mess with me."  
"What are you saying...?"  
  
These guys noticed that the strong warriors around them were glaring at
them with bloodshot eyes.  
  
"W-what is it?"  
  
The guys were surprised that heavyweights from the mercenary corps were
mixed in.  
  
"R-really... We're sorry!!"  
  
Hisui sighed in relief.  
  
"Aoi is popular. I'm jealous because she's beautiful..."  
"What are you saying? Hisui is very cute."  
"Hehehe. Thank you."  
"Okay. Shall we have another drink in the room after we drink a little
more?"  
"Yes, let's do that."  
  
Hisui replied happily.  
  
â€”  
  
"What was I trying to do..."  
  
Aoi and Hisui had a little more to drink in their room. They continued
the fun conversation from the tavern, and just as they were about to go
to bed, Aoi muttered.  
  
"It's too early to draw any conclusions. Tomorrow we'll be organizing
the expedition to the fifth seal. Let's go to bed now."  
  
Hisui said that and opened her arms.  
  
"Come on, come here. I'll hug you tight all night today."  
"Okay."  
  
Aoi obediently snuggled into Hisui's arms.  
  
"It's warm and smells good..."  
  
Aoi hugged Hisui tightly. Like a child clinging to its mother.  
  
"When I saw the engraving circle, I thought my heart would burst. I was
the one who lifted the curse on the Sugal Plains and the 1st seal. Maybe
I'm destroying what Luke tried to protect with his whole life."  
"Let's go to bed. I'm here, so it's okay. There's nothing to be afraid
of. Rest assured..."  
  
Aoi nodded at Hisui's words and closed her eyes.  
  
"That's right. Everything will be after we hear the story from the Lich.
I can't afford to be discouraged by something like this."  
  
Hisui stroked Aoi's back without saying anything. Aoi's back, which
always seemed big, felt very small.
