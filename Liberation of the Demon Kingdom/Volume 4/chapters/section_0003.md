# Chapter 88: As a Knight of the Demon Kingdom

"Dustis, this is from Berg."  
  
Aoi casually tossed Berg's official letter to Dustis, as if handing it
to a friend.  
  
"Thank you."  
  
Dustis, without any particular formality, opened the letter and reread
it three times.  
  
"Okay. Aoi, come with me."  
  
Dustis led Aoi and the others to another room.  
  
"Wait here for a moment."  
  
Soon after, Dustis returned with a young girl. Her ears were slightly
pointed. She was a half-elf, about 10 years old.  
  
"Let me introduce you. This is Susano, my child with Shurak."  
  
Susano lowered her head adorably.  
  
"I’m Aoi, your big sister. Nice to meet you."  
  
Aoi spoke gently to Susano and then turned back to Dustis.  
  
"Dustis."  
  
Her face was tense. Hisui also felt something strange about Susano.  
  
"Dark magicules..."  
  
Her potential power was immense.  
  
(She might have as many magicules as Aoi...)  
  
Sweat dripped from Hisui's forehead.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui, I told you before that I knew three users of darkness. Luke,
myself, and Shurak. And now Hisui has joined us. Another one. And with
considerable potential power..."  
  
Hisui unconsciously clenched her hands tightly.  
Dustis began to speak quietly.  
  
"First, the liberation of the Demon Continent requires users of
darkness. Right now, there are four users.  
On the other hand, sealing the Demon Continent requires a shrine
maiden.  
Shurak. Shurak doesn't have enough magicules to be a shrine maiden.  
Aoi. Her light magicules are too strong. She might be good for
dispelling seals, but like Aldey, she would have to seal her light
magicules to become a shrine maiden.  
If that’s the case, that leaves Hisui or Susano with the qualifications
to be a shrine maiden… These are the two that the Order of Chaos is
after.  
Aoi, I have a feeling that the current Order's movements are different
from Luke's goals. Luke hated the development of magic above all else.  
But the current Order is using engraving magic to create more powerful
weapons. Doesn't that go against Luke's interests?  
  
Aoi bit her lip and listened to Dustis. Certainly, Luke hindered the
development of magic and the kingdom out of fear of large-scale
destruction.  
However, he never harmed others or craved wealth and power to enhance
his own strength. He would never use children to supply magicules for
engraving magic.  
  
"Aoi, I want to try and break the seven seals on the Demon Continent. I
don't know what the Order's goal is.  
But our goal of liberating the Demon Continent remains the same. Hey,
Aoi. Won't you lend me your strength in the liberation of the Demon
Continent, or rather, the Demon Kingdom?"  
  
Aoi looked into Hisui's eyes. Hisui looked back at Aoi and nodded
strongly.  
  
"Yes, the liberation of the Demon Kingdom is my, no, our wish. We would
be happy to cooperate with you."  
  
Dustis nodded and turned her gaze to Aoi and Hisui.  
  
"Hisui, I appoint you as an S-Rank knight of the Demon Kingdom. And Aoi,
I appoint you as the commander of the Demon Kingdom mercenary corps,
with Hisui as the vice commander. Is that alright?"  
"Wait, wait. Dustis. What's going on?"  
  
Dustis silently handed Aoi the official letter from Berg.  
It stated that,  
The Asura Kingdom wished to break the seals on the Demon Kingdom and
progress its development.  
However, it did not want the Demon Kingdom to develop and become a
threat.  
The condition for this was to welcome Aoi and Hisui as executives of the
Demon Kingdom and grant them authority as balancers.  
If this were to be achieved, the Asura Kingdom would fully support the
Demon Kingdom. The above was written in the letter.  
  
Aoi looked up at the ceiling and sighed, then looked at Hisui,  
  
"Partner! What should we do?"  
  
She asked with a serious face.  
  
"Yes, I won’t back down. I'll take half of Aoi's worries! That's all."  
  
Hisui's answer was as straightforward as ever.  
  
"Okay. Dustis. I respectfully accept this offer."  
  
Aoi knelt on one knee and showed allegiance. Hisui followed Aoi.  
  
"Thank you. Aoi. Hisui. But you don't need to show allegiance to me. I
want you to treat me as a friend."  
  
Dustis said this and burst into tears.  
  
"Okay, I get it. You're still such a crybaby."  
  
Aoi and Hisui stood up and approached Dustis, and the three hugged each
other tightly.
