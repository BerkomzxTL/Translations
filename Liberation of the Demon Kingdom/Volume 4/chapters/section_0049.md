# Chapter 134: Before the Battle

The Order of Chaos, having completely seized the Bizes Territory, began
their advance towards the Demon Capital. The Bizes Territory is located
approximately 5 days away.  
Dustis chose to defend the Demon Capital in order to prevent the
dispersion of forces and to lengthen the Order of Chaos' supply lines.
She judged that the Order of Chaos would be unable to sustain a
prolonged war.  
In fact, the Order of Chaos could not expect supplies or reinforcements.
Buenos' sole objective was to seize the engraving circle, and he would
not have minded if the Order's army was annihilated once that objective
was achieved.  
  
The Demon Capital was a city surrounded by walls for about 2 km.
However, it was not entirely enclosed. Only the royal castle was
surrounded by walls and moats, and most of the residents of the Demon
Capital lived in houses outside the walls.  
The Order of Chaos' attack on the Demon Capital was known to the city's
residents from an early stage. The people were evacuated under the
guidance of the Demon Kingdom Knights. Many residents took up arms and
volunteered for the mercenary corps.  
Two days before the Order of Chaos arrived, the evacuation of all the
residents of the Demon Capital was completed. The Demon Kingdom Army
took up positions with the deserted city behind them.  
This time, the mercenary corps would take the lead. The commander was
Hisui. Hisui created three golems and transferred the command authority
to Zilberk.  
  
"The vice commander’s control over magicules is as wonderful as ever!"  
  
This was Zilberk's assessment of Hisui. And,  
  
"If you can't defend even one of the defense lines after being given
this, you don't deserve to be in α Squad."  
  
Zilberk was very enthusiastic.  
  
"Miss Hisui, the mercenary corps has completed its deployment."  
  
Hisui entrusted the detailed responses during combat to Bardock and the
β Squad. Hisui would only handle the overall command and respond to
sudden crises.  
  
"Bardock, thank you. I want the α Squad, except for Zilberk's golems, to
be a mobile unit. I'm sorry to burden the β Squad with so much."  
"No, I want to protect the Demon Capital and you, Sis."  
  
Bardock answered Hisui with a straight look.  
  
"Besides, so many residents of the Demon Capital have joined the
mercenary corps."  
  
Beyond Bardock's gaze was a group building barricades and organizing
weapons. Cheers rose from time to time, and their morale was extremely
high.  
  
"Miss Hisui, let's defend the Demon Capital with the mercenary corps!"  
  
Hisui nodded firmly at those words.  
  
—  
  
"No, you can't. You must not get up."  
  
Marsim couldn't take her eyes off Aoi. Because she immediately tried to
get up and go somewhere.  
  
"What's the current situation?"  
"The Order's army will appear in the Demon Capital tomorrow. Miss Mao is
organizing an elf unit to carry out a night raid. They are burning food
supplies, but they don't seem to care and are advancing anyway."  
"Buenos' objective is the engraving circle. Even if the army is
annihilated, it's fine as long as Buenos secures the circle here. It
looks like it will be a short battle."  
  
Marsim glared at Aoi with a stern look and then said slowly.  
  
"You can't. I mean it."  
"I haven't said anything..."  
"What's not allowed is not allowed. Miss Aoi, it's always written all
over your face..."  
"I understand..."  
"Miss Aoi, promise me. I'm not a monster either. When it's absolutely
necessary, do as you please. But never die!! Okay!!"  
"Yeah. I understand. I'll do as Marsim says."  
  
Aoi said that and closed her eyes quietly. Marsim gently placed a
blanket over Aoi.  
  
(Miss Aoi, please take it easy for now...)  
  
—  
  
Two days later, Hisui and Shurak were looking down from the top of the
royal castle at the Order of Chaos' army facing off against the Demon
Kingdom’s Army. Their numbers were about 5,000. The Demon Kingdom Army,
on the other hand, numbered about 30,000.  
Moreover, it was a defensive battle. Normally, the Order would have no
chance of winning.  
  
"It's eerie, isn't it."  
"Yes. Mao has burned a considerable amount of food. It should be
difficult for the Order to maintain its army..."  
"Miss Hisui, I leave the vanguard to the mercenary corps. Thank you for
your hard work."  
"No, I'm afraid of the Order, no, Buenos. That's why I want to fight
quickly. I want to settle things quickly. I'm grateful that you've
entrusted me with the vanguard."  
  
Shurak turned on his heels after giving a Demon Kingdom salute. Hisui
also responded with a Demon Kingdom salute to Shurak's back.  
  
"Mr. Shurak, the mercenary corps will begin the attack in half an
hour."
