# Chapter 144: Fragment 1

**-Complementary Story- Fragments**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
"Well, I'm off then."  
"Okay, have fun. Hehehe. Have a nice day."  
  
Mirei sent Luke off with a smile as he headed off to the ceremony
looking satisfied.  
This ceremony was to celebrate the completion of the *‘City Defense’*
magic circle, a project Luke was passionate about.  
Mirei knew. Luke had placed a seal on Mirei to protect her from disease
because she was physically weak. And that Luke had been forced to bear a
great burden because of it. Mirei was glad that Luke cared about her.  
  
"Thanks Luke..."  
  
Mirei called out to Luke as he walked out the front door.  
  
"Eh? Mirei? Did you say something?"  
"No, it's nothing. Just be careful!"  
  
It was just a casual conversation. Neither Luke nor Mirei knew that this
would be their last conversation.  
  
—  
  
"I will transform the magicules that fill this world into darkness and
transfer it to me. The spell is complete. Luke, you will witness the
birth of a god. What an honor."  
  
Luke faced Dullahan on the top floor of the tower that stood in the
center of the capital.  
  
"Dullahan! Have you gone mad?!"  
  
Luke desperately tried to stop Dullahan, who was trying to gain power by
converting the magicules of the capital's people into dark magicules
using a magic circle.  
  
(Mirei! You! I will protect you to the end!!)  
  
Luke struggled desperately as he was crushed by Dullahan's gravity
magic.  
  
"Watch there. When I infuse this magic stone with magicules, the spell
will be activated. A god will be born."  
  
Dullahan poured magicules into the magic stone. At that moment, the seal
Luke and the other Magic Knights had placed on it was activated. The
five magical elements of the people in the capital were transformed into
dark magicules. And then...  
  
(The dark magic has been transferred! Mirei's life is in danger!)  
  
Only Mirei! Mirei!  
Luke's desperate actions produced a small miracle.  
The arrow of light that Luke had fired shifted the position of the magic
stone ever so slightly, shifting the center of the engraving slightly
and moving it to Luke, who was captured by the gravitational field.  
  
(Ahhh. Life is flowing in! Stop it!!)  
  
Luke felt the lives of the people of the capital gathering around him.  
  
"Mirei!!"  
  
Luke screamed, but the flow of life could not be stopped.  
  
—  
  
"What is it?"  
  
Mirei was looking out the window at the tower towering over the capital.
She felt like magicules were being drawn to the tower. It was the first
time she had ever felt such an unpleasant sensation.  
  
"Huh? Luke??"  
  
Suddenly, Mirei felt as if Luke was calling her.  
  
"Run?"  
  
At that moment, an immense amount of magicules began to fill the tower.
The power filled the capital like a tide and then began to flow back
towards the tower. The power sapped the people's magicules and took
their life force.  
  
"The magic... the power... it's sucking my life out..."  
  
At that moment, Mirei was no longer able to stand and collapsed to the
ground.  
  
"Ugh... what is this...?"  
  
At that moment, Mirei thought she heard Luke's voice again.  
  
"Mirei! You! I will protect you to the end!!"  
  
At that moment, Mirei felt the presence of a warm power protecting her
soul! Though her body collapsed to the ground, her soul was being
protected by an invisible power!  
  
"Ahh, it's warm..."  
  
Even though Mirei felt a warm presence close to her, her consciousness
sank into a white world.  
  
—  
  
When Mirei regained consciousness she found herself in a dark, warm and
cozy place.  
  
(Where am I?)  
  
It was a very reassuring feeling and Mirei felt at peace.  
  
Luke, where are you now?  
  
As her mind drifted back and forth, Mirei found herself vaguely thinking
about Luke. How long had it been since she'd parted ways with him?  
Her consciousness drifting gently in the rocking cradle. Mirei wondered
why she didn't feel lonely.  
  
(Luke...I wonder if I'm not lonely because I can sense you...?)  
  
As her consciousness drifted, it suddenly occurred to her that she was
suddenly transported from this place of comfort into a world filled with
brightness and light.  
  
(Scary... Where am I?)  
  
Could this fear be a human instinct? Mirei cried out in fear.  
  
"Ogyaa ogyaa"  
  
Mirei's cry was inarticulate, but it was the most blessed cry in the
world.  
  
"Hehe, my baby."  
  
Mirei's fears were eased when she was held in warm, soft arms, hearing
the sound of a pounding heart and a gentle voice.  
  
"Wow, how sweet! I'm your big sister."  
  
Mirei was sent into this world with the blessings of many people.  
  
"Hey, mom, what's the kid's name?"  
"Yes, this is Mirai. This child's name is Mirai."  
"Mirai..."  
  
The girl whispered the baby's name lovingly.  
Mirai. That was the new name given to Mirei.  
  
--  
  
That year, Mirai turned 16. She had a beautiful appearance similar to
Mirei's. A healthy body. Mirai had grown into a girl who was well-known
in the village. And above all, she had a great amount of mana. By that
time, Mirai had completely lost her memories of when she was Mirei.  
  
"Mirai! What are you doing tomorrow?"  
"You're welcome, big sister! I'm always ready!"  
  
Mirai and her sister Misuzu lived as A-Rank adventurers, taking on many
requests.  
Misuzu was also renowned as an adventurer with her high amount of mana
and brilliant swordsmanship, and was a proud older sister to Mirai.  
Tomorrow she was planning to investigate some ancient ruins with the
same team of A-Rank adventurers.  
  
"I see. Well then, why don't we go out for dinner now?"  
"Eh? Is sister  going to treat me?"  
"Hmm, I can't help it. Maybe I should feed my cute little sister
sometimes."  
"Okay, since you're my cute little sister, I'll let you feed me."  
  
Mirai and Misuzu were really close sisters.  
  
"Hehe. Well then, let's go out."  
  
The town where the two live is a place that would be called the "Demon
Continent" in the future. It was once the capital of the Magic Kingdom.
Several decades have passed since that tragedy, and the town has
returned to its former bustle.  
The two of them arrived at a bar that had recently become popular in the
town.  
  
"Uncle! Two ales! And give me some stewed pork, and, hmm, pickles and
rillettes!"  
  
Mirai watched with delight as her sister quickly ordered one drink after
another as soon as she secured a seat at the bar.  
  
"So, big sis, what was the story?"  
"Eh? Why? How do you know?"  
"Well, I've been your little sister for many years."  
  
Misuzu laughed lightly.  
  
"I was thinking over some ale... I'm thinking about getting married."  
  
Mirai had never expected that answer. She had never imagined that her
sister, who was always swinging a sword around and had no sex appeal,
had a boyfriend and was thinking about marriage.  
  
"Eh? Sis, you have a boyfriend?"  
"You've been my little sister for so many years, yet you're still so
insensitive!"  
  
Seeing her sister smiling carefreely, Mirai sincerely wished for her
happiness.  
  
"I thought I'd be the one to get married first!"  
"What are you talking about, you don't even have a boyfriend…"  
  
Just then, the ale arrived. Ale chilled well with ice magic.  
  
"Fufu, big sister! I'm so happy! Let's have a toast!"  
"Yeah."  
"Well then, cheers to my sister's happy marriage!"  
  
Mirai and Misuzu clinked their glasses of ale together.  
  
"Big sister! Introduce me to your boyfriend next time. Ah! You can
introduce me to his friends too."  
  
Mirai's lightheartedness made Misuzu laugh.  
  
"You have high standards."  
"That's not true. I'm more than happy if they're stronger, kinder, and
cooler than me."  
"Kind and cool are one thing, but there aren't many people stronger than
you…"  
  
Haa, Mirai sighed.  
  
"Ugh, well, I'll look slowly. Anyway, where did you meet your
boyfriend?"  
"Ehehe, that's..."  
  
The sisters' pleasant chat continued until late at night.  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
It's been a while. This is a story connecting Mirei and Luke to Aoi and
Hisui.  
Fragments. It's a sad story, but I hope you can feel the connection
between Aoi and Hisui's souls.
