# Chapter 118: Exchange Meeting (2)

Before they knew it, the knights of Mars Territory and the knights of
the Demon Kingdom had also joined the banquet, and a circle had formed
around Aoi. For some reason, food was being brought in. Then the Mitsui
squad joined them.  
  
"Hey, Count Mars will be angry with you."  
"No way. Miss Aoi is forcing me to drink."  
"I see. Then it can't be helped."  
  
Saying that, Mitsui also started drinking.  
  
"Miss Hisui. I was greatly helped by Miss Luca today. She’s a very
strong wind user."  
  
Mao reacted to those words.  
  
"Right, right? Luca from my squad is amazing, right!"  
"Squad Leader Mao. It's embarrassing, so please stop..."  
"No, Luca's wind is really amazing. Even I can't beat her with magic!"  
"Mao is a musclehead."  
"Miss Aoi. Don't say things like thatーー."  
  
Ignoring Mao, who clung to Aoi, Luca faced Mitsui.  
  
"Likewise. I did something intrusive."  
"No, I would definitely like to work with you again."  
  
Hisui was very happy. To be able to drink with someone who was an enemy
three years ago like this.  
  
"Hisui, this is fun, isn't it?"  
"Yes, Aoi. It’s fun."  
  
Then Dustis and Mars opened the door and entered the venue.  
  
"Are you already drinking?"  
  
Zilba replied to Mars, who looked unhappy.  
  
"Ha! Lady Aoi is forcing me to drink!"  
  
At that answer, Mars looked at Dustis and sighed.  
  
"I see. Then it can't be helped. Hey, Mars. Shall we have a drink
too?"  
"Indeed. If Miss Aoi is forcing me, it can't be helped."  
  
Zilba looked at Aoi, who was grinning, and was filled with disbelief.  
  
(Just who is Miss Aoi?)  
  
—  
  
"By the way, Miss Aoi. Our Marsim has said that she wants to become your
maid."  
"Oh, right. What shall we do, Mars?"  
  
Aoi answered Mars while looking at Marsim, who was shrinking behind
Mars.  
  
"That's wonderful! I have always thought that the Mars knights must see
the outside world!  
Marsim is a young woman with potential. If she can learn under Miss Aoi,
Marsim's world will expand!  
She must not be confined to the Mars territory!"  
  
Aoi was thinking about Hisui.  
  
(Certainly, Hisui is bound by the strange common sense of the Mars
territory when it came to the dance with Arcadia and her sense of
fashion.  
Or rather, isn't that Mars' fault?!)  
  
"O-oh. I understand. Marsim. Are you really sure?"  
"Yes. Please take care of me!"  
  
Aoi handed a cup to Marsim, who answered energetically.  
  
"Alright, then let's toast! Nice to meet you, Marsim."  
"Aoi, you have another follower. Introduce him."  
  
Aoi's eyes darted around at Dustis' words.  
  
"A, ah. That's right. This is Flail. Er, an ancient dragon. He has
become my servant. Everyone, please treat him well."  
"I see. Aoi. So from now on, we can borrow Flail's power to undo the
seals. Wonderful."  
  
The venue erupted at Dustis' words.  
  
"Yes, I am Flail, one of the oldest dragons, the Flame Dragon. As Lady
Aoi's servant, I will work to undo the seals."  
  
Flail said while prostrating himself at Aoi's feet.  
  
"Woo-hoo. Amazing!"  
"Miss Aoi is still amazing!"  
"Aoi! Aoi!"  
  
Aoi, the person in question, was bewildered by the unexpected Aoi
chants. Hisui patted Aoi on the shoulder.  
  
"That's good, Aoi."  
"Yeah. That's right! Alright!"  
  
Suddenly, Aoi stood up and took Dustis' and Mars' hands and raised them
high.  
  
"The enemies who fought three years ago are now holding hands like this!
The Demon Kingdom will definitely be liberated! Everyone, please lend me
your strength!!"  
"Whoaa. Aoi! Aoi!"  
  
Dustis and Mars saw hope in the never-ending Aoi chanting.  
  
(Ah. The Demon Kingdom will definitely be liberated...)
