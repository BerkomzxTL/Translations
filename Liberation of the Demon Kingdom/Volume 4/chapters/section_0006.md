# Chapter 91: The Trials Welcome Party

Dustis said,  
  
"I'm just going to..."  
  
and went somewhere and didn't come back.  
Mao wanted to run away. She liked alcohol. No, she loved it. But these
mercenaries were bad news. She felt her chastity was in danger. With
teary eyes, she looked at Hisui, but Hisui had a burning sense of
mission in her eyes, so Mao gave up relying on Hisui early.  
  
"Aoi, I'm feeling a little unwell..."  
"Oh, Mao. Just in time."  
  
Saying that, Aoi spread out a map of the Demon Kingdom.  
  
"This is a detailed map."  
  
Hisui was impressed by how intricate the map was.  
  
"Yeah. Dustis lent it to me."  
  
Aoi urged Hisui and Mao to look at the map again.  
  
"Right now, there are seven seals on this kingdom placed by the Demon
God of Chaos. We want to break these seals. However, I believe we can
break the first five seals.  
It won't be easy, but it's not impossible. The reason why the seals
haven't been undone until now is because Luke was strongly preventing
the dispelling of the curse. Right now, there are four people in this
kingdom who can dispel the curse. Me, Hisui, Shurak, and Susano.  
I'm thinking of teaching the dispelling incantations for seals 1 through
5 to Shurak or Susano to have them removed.  
The problem is seals 6 and 7. These are the key locations for the curse
to activate. That's why Luke turned these into dungeons. Dungeons are
usually handled by small parties. Mao, can you lend us your strength?  
  
Mao was happy to be invited by Aoi. She looked at Aoi with sparkling
eyes and replied immediately.  
  
"Yes, Miss Aoi. If I can be of help, I will. No, please take me with
you!"  
  
Aoi took Mao's hand and gripped it tightly.  
  
"Thank you, Mao. By the way, you seem fine... Are you feeling unwell?"  
"No, it's nothing at all..."  
  
Oh, Mao looked like she was troubled! But in the end, she ended up
attending the welcome party.

Bardock wanted to talk to Aoi. What a shame. In the middle of their
serious match, Bardock was captivated by Aoi's beauty. Aoi's movements
were efficient and agile, and yet, there was strength and elegance.  
  
"How pitiful…"  
  
Bardock was in love. How many years had it been since his heart had
fluttered so much? However, this love was facing a test.  
  
"Oh, he's gotten hung up again..."  
  
A man who had been chugging alcohol next to Bardock muttered. That's
right! This was the trial of Bardock's love.  
  
—  
  
"Commander Aoi, I'm one of the best light users in this mercenary group.
Let's lead this mercenary group together. I'll take good care of you at
night, Commander... Oooooh!"  
  
Aoi sighed and quietly looked up at Hisui, who was emitting murderous
intent next to her. Hisui bound the suspicious men who tried to hit on
Aoi with earth magic and hung them from the high ceiling of the training
ground.  
  
"One, two, three... Miss Aoi, that's amazing. There are seven people
hanging up there."  
  
Mao couldn't understand the mercenaries who tried to hit on Aoi, knowing
they would be taken down by Hisui.  
And then another person appeared to take on this reckless challenge. It
was Bardock. Bardock approached Aoi with a bottle of distilled liquor
with a high alcohol content (the ingredients were unknown...) which was
common in the Demon Kingdom.  
  
"Commander Aoi, I apologize for earlier."  
"Oh, I look forward to working with you."  
  
Aoi said that and extended her right hand. Bardock shook it.  
  
"Likewise, I look forward to working with you. Sis."  
"Hold on, hold on. You called me something weird just now. Call me
Commander."  
"No, I use this title for people I respect. I hope you'll allow me,
Sis."  
  
Hisui made a face that said, "Oh?"  
  
"Hmm, well, it's fine, but there's a condition."  
  
Aoi said that and grinned at Bardock.  
  
"Cooperate with us completely. There are certainly others in the
mercenary group who are superior in swordsmanship, have more magicules,
or have higher physical abilities, but your squad has the best
balance.  
And more than anything, Bardock has good sense. The proof is that you
haven't been hung up by Hisui. If Bardock cooperates, it will be easier
for us to lead the team."  
  
Bardock thought that if they showed such overwhelming power, most people
in the Demon Kingdom would obey, but,  
  
(Ah, she sees right through my feelings.)  
  
He changed his mind and gladly accepted Aoi's offer.  
  
"Sis, I look forward to working with you as well. Also, I'll introduce
my comrades again. Unfortunately, they're all bedridden..."  
"Yeah, bring them over later, and I'll heal them."  
  
Aoi said to Bardock, not showing on her face that she had forgotten.
