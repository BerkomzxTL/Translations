# Chapter 136: I Am a Maid of the Six Heroes!!

"Hyaa!"  
  
Marsim stood out on the battlefield. This was because she was running
through the chaotic battlefield while carrying Aoi on her back. Many
soldiers from the Order of Chaos aimed at Marsim and attacked.  
  
(There are few allies here...)  
  
The place Marsim was trying to break through was crowded with Order of
Chaos soldiers. Marsim regretted her foolshiness. But regretting it
wouldn't change the situation.  
Marsim switched her mindset and swung her rapier. She wondered how many
Order of Chaos soldiers she had cut down already. After the fifth one,
Marsim stopped counting.  
  
(They're still coming!!)  
  
Marsim was felling the attacking soldiers with sheer willpower, but she
was already battered and exhausted. Her hand holding the rapier was
numb.  
  
"I am a maid of the Six Heroes, the *'Nameless Magic Warrior'* ! I can't
lose to something like this!"  
  
Marsim shouted. To encourage herself.  
Marsim released a wind blade and bisected three goblins.  
  
"Haa, haa, haa!"  
  
Marsim was panting. She had little magicules left. Still, she dodged the
spear of a charging soldier at the last moment and thrust her rapier.  
  
"Guh, haa, haa."  
  
The golem was still far away. Marsim put strength into her legs and took
a step forward.  
  
"Don't lose, Marsim! To Miss Hisui's place..."  
  
Marsim swung her rapier, encouraging herself. But a fire magic attack
struck Marsim. Marsim took the magic attack on her right hand and
dropped her rapier.  
  
"The woman is unarmed! Kill her quickly!"  
  
Vulgar words flew from the Order of Chaos soldiers.  
  
"Guaaaa!"  
  
Marsim, filled with spirit, released wind magic at the attacking
soldier.  
  
"I'll definitely protect Miss Aoi no matter what!"  
"Woman! Admiring your spirit, I'll make you my plaything!"  
  
The sword swung by the soldier grazed Marsim's left arm. Blood
splattered. Marsim could no longer move her arm. But her eyes still
hadn't given up. She bit the approaching soldier's shoulder.  
  
"You bitch!!"  
  
Marsim was slapped in the face and rolled to the ground.  
  
"Miss Aoi!"  
  
Marsim got up and covered Aoi, who had rolled to the ground from the
impact of the blow.  
  
(I'll protect Miss Aoi no matter what!)  
  
"Don't screw with me!"  
  
The soldier kicked Marsim, who was covering Aoi. Marsim didn't even
groan. She relentlessly protected Aoi.  
  
"Then die here together!"  
  
The soldier tried to pierce Marsim and Aoi with his sword.  
  
"Miss Aoi, I'm sorry. I couldn't keep... my promise..."  
  
However, the impact didn't come. Marsim cautiously raised her face.
There,  
  
"Miss Mao..."  
  
Mao stood, having cut down the soldier with her wind magic sword.  
  
"Marsim! You did well! Leave the rest to us!"  
  
With that, Mao created a wind blade and mowed down the surrounding
soldiers.  
  
"Miss Marsim, I'll heal you."  
  
Force applied healing to Marsim.  
  
"Miss Mao! Take Miss Aoi to Miss Hisui!"  
  
Mao nodded at Marsim's words.  
  
"Mikazuchi, carry Miss Aoi on your back! Marsim, Hisui is with the
golem! Can you run??"  
"Yes, I'm fine now. I can run."  
  
Marsim answered energetically, and with her rapier in hand, she started
running, chasing after Mao and the others.  
  
â€”  
  
The dark magic was lifted. What Zilberk saw there was a situation where
enemies and allies were jumbled around the golem. In that situation,
Zilberk was maintaining the battle line well. A group of powerful
monsters was attacking the golem, but he was holding them off.  
  
"Hah hah hah, Vice Commander Hisui's golem stands out, after all!"  
  
Zilberk ordered the golem and crushed one of the attacking ogres.  
  
"There's no end to it."  
  
He punched another ogre.  
  
"How many mercenary troops are left?"  
  
Zilberk asked a nearby mercenary soldier.  
  
"Yes! About 30, I think. The enemy is about 150, including magic
beasts."  
"Is it the right time to retreat? Hey, you, withdraw the soldiers."  
"But..."  
"What. I and the golem will serve as the rearguard. After all, the vice
commander's golem is strong!"  
  
The soldier saw Zilberk's determination. This person intends to die
here.  
  
"Understood! I'll withdraw the troops! Good luck!"  
"Well, let's have a rampage!"  
  
Zilberk poured magicules into the golem and started running toward the
area with many magic beasts.
