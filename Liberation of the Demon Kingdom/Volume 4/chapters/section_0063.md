# Chapter 148: The Wind Brigade (2)

"An-y-ways, they started it first!"  
"But, you know, the table's broken, and they puked, right? There are
customers who left after seeing that..."  
  
Aoi and Hisui were brought to the branch of the Wind Brigade and were
being interrogated. But the one doing the talking was a gentle-looking
leader who was intimidated by Aoi's momentum.  
  
"Mr. Carville. I just want to get paid for the repairs. That table is
quite expensive..."  
  
The owner of the bar interjected from the side.  
  
"Get it from them."  
"They don't have any money at all..."  
  
Aoi and Hisui exchanged glances.  
  
"Well, then, it can't be helped. Let's hand them over to the military
police and have them judged."  
  
At that moment, a well-built man came out from the back.  
  
"Sis. That'll take a while to get money. The shop owner's in trouble.
Just pay it quietly, okay?"  
"Who are you?"  
"I'm the vice-branch chief, Musaba, here. Let’s see... the amount is
about 5 gold coins."  
"Mr. Musaba, that's too much..."  
"Shut up! Carville! That's why you're no good!"  
  
“Haa,” Hisui sighed, watching this exchange.  
  
"I understand. I'll pay the money. But I'll discuss it with the shop
owner and decide. Isn't that okay with you too, shop owner?"  
  
Musaba was enraged when he heard that.  
  
"Sis! That's not how it works. If you don't want to get hurt, do as
you're told!"  
  
Hisui glared at Musaba with eyes filled with killing intent.  
  
"I don't like this at all!"  
  
Musaba swung his fist at Hisui's face.  
  
"Gwao! Ouch!!"  
  
Hisui immediately covered her face with iron.  
  
"You bastards! Hey, surround them!"  
  
However, no one responded to Musaba's voice.  
  
"You guys!"  
  
Musaba drew his sword.  
  
"Haa, I can't help it if a weapon is drawn."  
  
Aoi stood up with a sway. At that moment,  
  
"Hey! What are you guys doing?"  
  
A low voice with a deep tone. Aoi and Hisui sensed that the other party
had considerable courage. The members who had been watching until then
straightened their backs as if they had been struck by something.  
  
"C-Chief!"  
  
Appearing there was Mao, and,  
  
"Ah! Gam!"  
  
Appearing there was Gam, who they had parted with in Asura Kingdom's
Barlmin territory.  
  
—  
  
"Ah! Miss Aoi! Miss Hisui! Why are you here?"  
" It's not *'Why are you here?'*  What are you doing here?"  
"Umm, well, I'm the one in charge here..."  
  
The Wind Brigade members were looking at Gam, who was flustered, as if
they were seeing something unusual.  
  
"The Chief is flustered... I've never seen it before..."  
"Gam... Are you the leader here?"  
  
Gam was even more shaken by Hisui's cold voice.  
  
"Hii, ah, y-yes, that's right. Miss Hisui..."  
"Then, get that guy out of my sight!"  
"Musaba! I'll hear the details later! Wait over there!"  
"But..."  
"Hurry up!"  
  
Musaba went to another room reluctantly.  
  
"Umm, well. Long time no see..."  
  
It was Aoi who responded to Gam's words.  
  
"Gam, it's been a while."  
  
Gam's face crumpled, and tears began to flow.  
  
"It's me. I, I've been thinking about you both! I'm so happy to see you
again!"  
  
Gam was about to hug Aoi when he felt a sharp killing intent.  
  
"Hii, hii--"  
"Gam hasn't changed since then? Do you want to die?"  
"S-sorry!"  
  
Aoi laughed because she found the situation funny.  
  
"Ahahaha! Gam was always being restrained by Hisui's magic!"  
"P-please stop it... There are my subordinates here..."  
  
Hisui glared at Gam.  
  
"I remember now. Gam tried to peek while Aoi and I were taking a
bath..."  
"Hii, hii, ah, a-at that time, I'm sorry!!!"  
  
In front of the chief who was kneeling on the spot, the members of the
Wind Brigade realized something.  
  
"Aoi and Hisui, are they the Free Knights?? T-there's no way??"  
"Ahem. This is Miss Aoi, an SSS-Rank Knight of the Demon Kingdom, and
Miss Hisui, an SS-Rank Knight of the Demon Kingdom."  
  
Everyone fell silent as Mao introduced the two of them with a smug look
on her face.  
  
"Ah, what?"  
  
Unlike Mao's expected reaction, the members couldn't speak because of
their surprise. The legendary heroes are here. The heroes who liberated
the Demon Kingdom and defeated the Demon God!  
  
"Well, that aside, I have a favor to ask of Gam..."  
"Yes, what is it?"  
"Actually..."  
  
—  
  
"Miss Aoi. I understand. If it's the Wind Brigade, please let us
help."  
  
In another room, Gam, who had received an explanation from Aoi, promised
to cooperate with a prompt reply.  
  
"Goddamn was Gam, huh? That's surprising, isn't it, Hisui!"  
"Yes, I was surprised."  
"Huh? What's Goddamn?"  
"It's the name of the leader of the Wind Brigade. It was written in the
Demon Kingdom Intelligence Division’s report."  
  
Gam seemed to have thought of something.  
  
"I wrote the registration form when I was active in the Demon Kingdom,
but I had someone else fill it in because I was in the Asura Kingdom.
That person was still learning to write, so maybe Gam became
Goddamn...?"  
  
Gam had received basic training in the Barlmin Knight Order and then
worked as a mercenary in the Asura Kingdom. Eventually, with the backing
of the Onjin Trading Company, he became famous as a guard for trade
caravans, and it seems he was able to organize a mercenary group. It
seemed there were many hardships, but Gam didn't talk about them.  
  
"I see... Is Mr. Onjin doing well?"  
"Yes, he's traveling all over the place. Well, mostly on trade caravans
to the Great Forest."  
  
In the Great Forest, the operation of golems is being carried out on a
large scale, and the transportation of those supplies is thriving.  
  
"Jim is even called *'Dr. Jim'* ."  
"I see. Jim is doing a great job..."  
  
Hisui thought back to her former disciple.  
  
"Ah, I also want to go back to the Great Forest sometime."  
"If it's Mao, you can ask Miss Anna and go back right away with the
* ‘Elven Gate'* , can't you?"  
  
Mao's expression clouded at Hisui's question.  
  
"Because the Spirit Queen won't let me just leave Miss Aoi and Miss
Hisui and go back to the Great Forest by myself. After all, I'm the
caretaker of the two of you!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui were dumbfounded at Mao, who was puffing out her chest.  
  
"It's okay if you don't take care of me, Mao..."  
"Aaan, Miss Aoi! That's so mean!"  
"Again! Mao is always hugging Aoi! Stay-a-way!"  
  
Aoi turned to Gam, watching the two of them flirting.  
  
"So, Gam. I want to take control of the underworld of the Demon Capital,
but before that, it might be a good idea to investigate the Wind Brigade
once, too."
