# Chapter 139: Demon God

The mercenary corps was attacking the Order of Chaos army on the hill in
waves. The Order of Chaos army was not fully utilizing its
geographically advantageous position on the hill.  
  
"Alright, we're cornering them!"  
  
Bardock shouted encouragement to the mercenary corps while cutting down
one of the Order of Chaos soldiers.  
  
(We can do this!)  
  
Bardock rushed up the hill and slammed his sword against the black-clad
magic swordsman.  
  
"!!"  
  
Bardock was shocked. Bardock's sword had been broken by Buenos' magic
sword.  
  
"What!"  
  
Bardock braced himself to be cut down by Buenos' cursed sword. However,
Bardock was caught by Hisui at the last moment and pulled away. The
cursed sword passed right in front of his eyes.  
  
"M-Miss Hisui, you saved me..."  
"Hisui?"  
  
Hisui evaded Buenos' cursed sword's range and fired a rail cannon shot.
Buenos unleashed the power of magicules eater and resisted the bullet
head-on. Power and power were evenly matched. Susano immediately fired
her railgun at Buenos.  
  
"I'm getting my sister back."  
  
The railgun fired by Susano slightly exceeded the magicules eater's
resistance. Buenos lost his balance and knelt. Susano ran to Sheema in
that gap and embraced her sister.  
  
"Sister!"  
  
Sheema didn't answer, but she was still breathing. Susano carried Sheema
on her back and started running. Marsim supported her side, guarding her
.  
  
"Buenos!!"  
  
Hisui drew Yagiri and unleashed a sharp thrust at Buenos. The tip of
Yagiri bent like a flexible whip, shattering Buenos' shoulder armor.  
  
"It can't be helped... It's your fault!!"  
  
Buenos screamed and took out a single orb. He channeled magicules into
it through the magicules eater.  
  
"Miss Hisui, something huge is coming!!!"  
  
Luca raised a yell that sounded like a scream.  
  
"Bardock!! The mercenary corps retreat immediately! Force, signal the
knights to retreat quickly too!"  
"Hahaha! It's too late!"  
  
The space above Buenos' head cracked, and something evil was teleported
in.  
  
"!!"  
"Everyone, get back!"  
  
It was about 20 meters in size. It had the shape of a human, but its
form was hideous and distorted. Powerful magicules that distorted the
surrounding space. It was a Demon God.  
  
"What is that..."  
  
Hisui fired the rail cannon at the Demon God at maximum output, but the
bullet burned out and disappeared before reaching it. At that moment,
the Demon God howled. It was a roar that evoked terror from the depths
of her heart.  
Hisui poured power into the Dragon Armament and drew Yagiri, jumping
towards the Demon God.  
  
"Deyaa--"  
  
Hisui unleashed all her ki from her whole body and swung Yagiri down on
the Demon God from above. However, Hisui's strike filled with spirit
also did not reach it. The Demon God flinched and unleashed a torrent of
dark magicules from its mouth.  
  
"I, I can't dodge it all!"  
  
The torrent of magicules shattered the Dragon Armament on Hisui's
shoulder, blowing away the roof of the royal castle behind her.  
  
"Fuhahaha. This is the power! The power that the Demon God of Chaos
feared and sealed! I will become one with this power and become the god
of this world!!"  
  
Buenos' loud laughter echoed around.  
  
(The shoulder armor is shattered... What power is this.)  
  
"Hisui, are you okay?"  
"Mao! I'm okay. How about everyone else?"  
"Yeah, I got them to retreat. That thing is a little tough, you know."  
"Thank you. What about Aoi too?"  
"Yeah, Miss Aoi too."  
  
Hisui nodded and readied Yagiri again.  
  
"Mao, sorry. Will you come with me?"  
"Of course! Hehehe, if I can die with Hisui..., it's my greatest
wish!"  
  
Hisui and Mao channled magicules into their whole bodies and ran towards
the Demon God.
