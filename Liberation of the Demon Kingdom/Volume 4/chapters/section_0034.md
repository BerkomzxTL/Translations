# Chapter 119: Railgun

The banquet was in full swing.  
  
Susano wanted to talk to Hisui. However, Hisui was surrounded by the
Knights of Mars in two or three layers, and she couldn't even get
close.  
  
"Haa..."  
  
Zilberk overheard Susano's sigh.  
  
"Hey, lass. What's wrong?"  
"Ah, Mr. Zilberk. I want to talk to Hisui, but I can't find an
opportunity."  
"Is that all?"  
  
The simple-minded Zilberk, without reading the atmosphere, pushed
through the knights and brought Susano to Hisui.  
  
"Here. The lass wants to talk about her weapon with Vice Commander
Hisui, right?"  
  
Susano looked at Zilberk with a "How did you know?" expression. And
then,  
  
"Hisui. Um..."  
"Susano. I have something I want to give you. Here! Zilberk helped
too."  
  
Hisui then handed Susano a hollow pipe-like object about 50cm long.  
  
"Oh, thank you, Hisui."  
  
Susano was excited thinking she would receive an amazing magic sword,
but she was perplexed by the unexpected object.  
  
"Heh, heh, heh. This is a railgun!"  
  
Everyone around recoiled at Hisui's smug face.  
  
"Eh, really? Aren't you guys surprised...?"  
"Uh, um. Hisui, what is this?"  
"It's a railgun!"  
  
Hisui answered confidently with a smug look.  
  
"Susano isn't good at swordsmanship, so I thought it would be better if
she could attack with magic, so I made it with Zilberk. Oh, and Aoi did
the engraving."  
  
Susano looked at the railgun in her hand.  
  
"This, you put this into the base of this hole."  
  
Hisui then took out a spindle-shaped iron ball weighing about 50g and
stuffed it into the hole of the gun.  
  
"And then, when you infuse it with magicules... the magicules convert
into lightning charge and push the ball out with explosive force. And,
there are three light engravings that repel in this cylindrical part. It
accelerates the explosively launched ball in three stages."  
  
Susano couldn't say anything to Hisui, who was speaking rapidly.  
  
(Maybe a magic sword would have been better...)  
  
Aoi changed the atmosphere of the place.  
  
"Hisui! Let's do a demonstration!"  
  
Following Aoi’s words, the situation shifted into a demonstration.  
  
"But it's dangerous..."  
"Okay, let's do it outside!"  
  
Hisui reluctantly agreed.  
  
"Okay then, everyone, let's demonstrate outside."  
  
With that, Hisui urged Susano to go outside. Everyone followed closely
behind Hisui.  
  
"Alright, since it's dangerous, let's shoot towards that mountain.
Susano, aim at the volcano."  
  
Susano pointed the railgun at the volcano.  
  
"Hold it tight. Load it with magicules. Fire!"  
  
The railgun emitted a crackling sound and pushed out the ball. The ball
was accelerated by the deployed triple light engraving magic and flew
out from the end of the cylinder. The impact and speed were tremendous.
The launched ball hit the mountainside about 1km away. A tremendous
flash of light and a delayed boom, followed by a blast, shook everyone's
cheeks.  
  
"Heheh! How is it!!"  
  
All eyes were on Hisui, who looked proud.  
  
"Hisui, this is too powerful..."  
"Oh, it's okay. The power can be adjusted by controlling the amount of
magicules..."  
"I, I see..."  
"Hey! Aoi! What are we going to do!"  
  
Aoi was flustered by Dustis' protests.  
  
"Well, don't ask me...! But, I think it's just right for subjugating the
guardian beast..."  
  
Dustis tilted her head and thought for a moment, but  
  
"That's true."  
  
She was easily convinced. Mars was the troublesome one.  
  
"Whoa! Hisui!! What is thatー! I want to shoot it too!!"  
"This is tailored for Susano, so that’s not possible."  
  
Mars, coldly rejected, turned to Susano.  
  
"Lady Susano. Would you mind showing it to me?"  
  
Mars took the railgun from Susano and began to examine its structure,
stroking it.  
  
"Hoo. It's made of mithril. It's reinforced to withstand explosions.
This shaping technique is amazing. How did you shape it?"  
  
While Mars was engrossed in the railgun, the Knights of Mars and the
Demon Kingdom Knights praised Hisui's railgun.  
  
"Whoa, Hisui!! That's amazingー!"  
"The seal will definitely be lifted!!"  
"Hisui! Hisui!"  
  
Hisui was perplexed by the surge of praise from everyone. Zilberk came
to Hisui's side and proudly declared.  
  
"Our Vice Commander is amazing, isn't she!!"  
"Uoooーー."  
  
The loudest cheers of the day resounded.
