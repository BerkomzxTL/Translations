# Chapter 143: Epilogue \~Tomorrow\~

**Last chapter of volume 4, The Demon Kingdom**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
That day, Berg, Anna, Aldey, and Aoi were gathered in Dustis' private
room. The five known as the Six Heroes.  
  
"I'm sure Jinrai would have liked to come too."  
  
The five mourned the now-deceased Jinrai.  
  
"Is that Aoi's new sword?"  
  
Berg asked, looking at the sword at Aoi's waist.  
  
"Yes. I wanted to show it to Jinrai..."  
"Hehe, yes. I’m sure Jinrai would have been so frustrated."  
  
Anna muttered wistfully.  
  
"Thank you all for coming today. I never thought we'd be able to gather
like this again."  
  
As Dustis said that, large tears streamed down her face.  
Anna gently embraced Dustis' shoulder.  
Dustis had ceded the throne of the Demon Kingdom to Susano. Today was
Susano's coronation ceremony.  
  
"Aoi, is your body okay?"  
  
Aldey asked Aoi, looking extremely worried.  
  
"Yes, I think so. I'm scared, so I haven't used magic since then..."  
"That's probably for the best, Aoi! The usual Aoi is terrifying, you
know. Right, Dustis?"  
"Hehe, yes. Anna and I were always scared of Aoi."  
"What?! You two were saying that?!"  
  
\*Knock knock knock\*  
  
The door was knocked on, and Marsim peeked her head in.  
  
"Everyone, preparations are complete, so please come this way."  
  
—  
  
In the plaza in front of the royal castle, many people had gathered. The
venue for the ceremony had noble seats, including those for the Six
Heroes, and seats for the general public. The general public's seats
were overflowing with people.  
  
"To the citizens of the Demon Kingdom, and to my loyal subjects. The sea
that has tormented this kingdom, no, the world, for so long has been
liberated by the hands of the heroes. First, I would like to express my
gratitude to all those who worked to undo the seal. And my condolences
to those who were called to the gods along the way."  
  
Dustis performed the Demon Kingdom-style salute.  
  
"I have ruled the Demon Kingdom for a long time, but with the removal of
the seal, I feel the arrival of a new era and decided to abdicate the
throne of the Queen. I hereby declare that I will be relinquishing my
throne as of today."  
  
Dustis beckoned Susano to her side.  
  
"Susano will be the new heir to the throne. Her wisdom and courage will
surely lead this kingdom to further prosperity. I sincerely hope that
you will spare no loyalty and support for the new monarch and build a
new era together."  
  
Dustis had Susano kneel and placed the crown on her head.  
  
"Uooo! The new Queen!"  
"Queen Susano!"  
  
The new Queen Susano was accepted by the people of the Demon Kingdom
with joy.  
  
—  
  
"Next, we will hold the investiture ceremony."  
  
Marsim's  voice echoed through the plaza.  
  
"Investiture ceremony? Just after Susano became Queen?"  
  
A stir ran through the people.  
  
"Ahem, then, Queen Susano, please request His Majesty Berg of the Asura
Kingdom for the investiture."  
  
\*Murmurs\*  
"From His Majesty Berg?"  
  
Susano stepped forward.  
  
"Asura Kingdom Rank A Knight, Demon Kingdom Rank S Knight Hisui. Asura
Kingdom Rank SSS Knight, Demon Kingdom Rank SSS Knight Aoi. Please step
forward."  
  
Aoi and Hisui were perplexed. They hadn't been told about this. The two
looked at each other, but were urged by Marsim to step forward in front
of Susano.  
  
"Hey, Berg, Susano. What's going on?"  
  
Aoi's whispered question was completely ignored.  
  
"Ahem, Hisui. I appoint you to Asura Kingdom Rank SS Knight, Demon
Kingdom Rank SS Knight."  
"Y-yes..."  
  
Hisui replied, bewildered.  
  
"And so... Asura Kingdom and Demon Kingdom Rank SSS Knight Aoi, and Rank
SS Knight Hisui. In the name of the Asura Kingdom and the Demon Kingdom,
I appoint the two of you as *'Free Knights'* .  
The Free Knights are granted the right to advise all institutions,
organizations, and subjects, including the King, in the Asura Kingdom
and the Demon Kingdom, and to correct their paths.  
Also, the Free Knights have the duty to correct the world. Aoi, Hisui.
Will you accept?"  
  
Aoi and Hisui exchanged glances for a moment, but their feelings were
both decided.  
  
"Yes, Your Majesty Queen Susano. We humbly accept."  
  
At that moment, an explosive cheer erupted from the plaza. People were
calling out the names of Aoi and Hisui.  
  
"Aoi, if you don't say something, this won't calm down."  
  
Susano said to Aoi with a grin.  
  
"E-eh, but I..."  
"Come on, what's someone who sliced a Demon God in half saying?"  
  
Pushed by Hisui, Aoi stepped forward. The plaza, which had been so
enthusiastic until then, became completely silent.  
  
"Ah, um, I've been granted the honorable position of Free Knight..."  
  
Voices came from the plaza as Aoi began to speak hesitantly.  
  
"Miss Aoi, that's not like you! Please do it in your usual style!"  
  
(That's Mao, isn't it? Hehe, that guy...)  
  
Aoi looked up at the sky and took a breath. The sky of the Demon Kingdom
was endlessly blue.  
  
"Everyone! The Demon Kingdom has been liberated! This is it! The result
of each and every one of us!! Be proud!  
And, the Demon Kingdom will continue to develop! I want you all to lend
me your strength in the future as well!! We who undid the 500-year curse
can do it!!  
Now, everyone! Let's create a new Demon Kingdom together!!"  
  
‘Uooo–’  
  
The plaza was filled with people's cheers. We, we are going to build a
new Demon Kingdom!  
Hisui felt proud of Aoi. Of her partner who overcame many trials and
showed hope to the people!  
  
"Aoi! My partner! We’ll be together from now!!"  
  
—  
  
Ten days later, Aoi and Hisui were given a small house in the outskirts
of the Demon Capital. Susano offered them a much larger mansion, but Aoi
and Hisui refused.  
  
"Because cleaning would be a pain..."  
  
Marsim, upon hearing that,  
  
"But I'm here!"  
  
She was indignant, but…  
Mao and Luca were visiting that house now.  
  
Susano restructured the organizations of the Demon Kingdom.  
Demon Kingdom Prime Minister: Sheema  
Commander of the Demon Kingdom Guard: Mikazuchi  
Commander of the Demon Kingdom Knights: Bardock  
Commander of the Demon Kingdom Mercenary Corps: Mao  
In addition, an Intelligence Division was newly established following
the example of the Asura Kingdom.  
Director of the Demon Kingdom Intelligence Division: Luca  
  
Aoi and Hisui's names were not in the new organizations. Because.  
  
"Miss Aoi, if you don't do this first, we'll be in trouble!"  
"What?! Miss Aoi, you said you'd listen to my consultation, right!"  
  
While Mao and Luca were starting to argue, Aoi quietly tried to escape.
But Mao grabbed her by the collar with a grin.  
  
"Hehe, I won't let you escape."  
"U-u, Susano! What's with the advisor role! I want to consult!"  
  
Demon Kingdom Advisors: Aoi and Hisui  
  
Hisui was watching the scene with a smile.  
  
"Aoi, do your best!"  
"What oooh! Hisui is also an advisor!"  
  
In the living room of Aoi and Hisui's small house, there was a painting
of the Six Heroes that had been in Aoi's house in the Asura Kingdom. And
next to it, there was…  
A new painting depicting Aoi, Hisui, and the members of α Squad smiling.
The painting was a portrait of the strong and kind heroes of the next
generation.  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Thank you very much for accompanying Aoi and Hisui's story for so
long.  
Let's meet somewhere again.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
TN: There are 2 short stories broken up into 4 parts. The first is the
lore behind why Hisui is Aoi’s “other half” (first mentioned at the end
of chapter 3). Second is just an extra post-liberation short story.  
  
I think I’ll just put this here instead of the very end... The story was
pretty shallow. It's a shame the (upcoming) short story wasn't
incorporated into the main story.  
  
Thanks for reading :)
