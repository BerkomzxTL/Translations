# Chapter 92: The Presence of a High Elf

After Bardock left, Aoi whispered to Hisui.  
  
"Are there any others that look promising to you, Hisui?"  
"Let me see. That ogre over there, then that tall human, and then...,
oh. That stern-looking dwarf, perhaps?"  
"What about Mao?"  
"Well, I guess that elf sister over there. I think she's a wind user,
and quite skilled."  
  
Hisui and Mao understood Aoi's intentions.  
Right now, Aoi is pretending to look very defenseless. Those who are
fooled by it and approach her will be hung from the ceiling by Hisui.
They may have skill, but their personalities are flawed...  
And by having a certain amount of alcohol, the relationships between the
members of the team become easier to understand. Trouble makers can also
be identified to some extent.  
In fact, the four people that Hisui and Mao noticed were not only
skilled, but also respected by those around them, and they were also
very considerate of those around them.  
  
"I see. Mao, ask Bardock for the names of the people we just mentioned.
Now, we'll be busy starting tomorrow! So let's drink some more alcohol
today!"  
  
Suddenly, Mao looked uneasy.  
  
"What's wrong, Mao?"  
  
Hisui asked worriedly.  
  
"I'm not good with these kinds of rough guys. I feel like my chastity is
in danger..."  
"It's okay, Mao! Anyone who thinks of doing anything indecent to you
will also be hung from the ceiling!"  
  
Hisui said powerfully.  
  
â€”  
  
"Ugh, I drank too much..."  
  
Yesterday, she was able to indulge in a fun time drinking after that.
Well, since then, 5 people who tried to lay a hand on Aoi and 4 people
who hit on Mao were additionally hung from the ceiling...  
Aoi cast a healing spell on herself and looked at Hisui, who was lying
next to her. Hisui was in her underwear.  
  
(Hmm, recently I've been drinking too much, and for some reason I'm
naked in the morning... Well, I know who the culprit is.)  
  
Aoi lay down next to the sleeping Hisui and quietly hugged her from
behind.  
  
(Ah... she smells so good... I want to stay like this forever...)  
  
Aoi buried her face in Hisui's nape and took a deep breath. Then, she
gently nibbled on Hisui's earlobe.  
  
"Ahhh,"  
  
Aoi was delighted to hear Hisui's sweet voice leak out. Just as she was
about to play another prank, Hisui woke up.  
  
"W-w-what are you doing naked, Aoi!"  
"You don't have to be so surprised."  
  
Aoi said that and kissed Hisui on the lips.  
  
"Hey, hey, Aoi. Please stop!"  
  
Aoi was shocked by Hisui's attitude.  
  
"What's wrong, Hisui? You don't have to hate it so much!"  
"B-b-because. Mao is watching..."  
  
When Aoi heard that, she quickly spun around and saw Mao watching them
with a bright red face.  
  
"No, this is, um..."  
"Aoi and Hisui are both wonderful. Please continue without worrying
about me."  
  
Mao fidgeted but kept staring at them without averting her gaze. After
that, Aoi became strangely adept at sensing the presence of high
elves.
