# Chapter 112: Marsim

"Nice to meet you today. I also want to tell Count Mars to take it easy.
Hisui, wouldn't that be better for you too?"  
  
Hisui looked at Aoi while supporting Marsim, who was clinging to her
chest and crying.  
  
"Yes, I also want to talk to everyone in the squad."  
"Okay. Then, someone guide me to Count Mars. Ah, Hisui is fine."  
  
Aoi stopped Hisui with her hand and left the room, guided by a knight
who was guarding the gate.  
  
"Miss Hisui! Long time no see. Everyone was worried. When we arrived,
Miss Hisui was unconscious, and then she was taken to the royal
capital.  
But I'm glad I could see you... Oh, right, Squad Leader Zilba is here
too. That person worships Miss Hisui like a goddess."  
"Vice Squad Leader Mitsui, I'm glad to see you're doing well too!"  
  
Marsim said in dissatisfaction from Hisui's chest.  
  
"Miss Hisui. Mr. Mitsui has become the Squad Leader now."  
"Really? I apologize for my rudeness."  
"That's not it. My Squad Leader is only Miss Hisui!!"  
  
Saying that, Marsim clung to Hisui again.  
  
"Oh dear... Marsim can't be helped."  
"Anyway, who is that woman?"  
"Eh? You mean Aoi? She's my partner..."  
  
(Someone so full of openings who shows no signs of any magicules?? Miss
Hisui's partner?? I'm Miss Hisui's partner!)  
  
Marsim didn't say it out loud, but she looked dissatisfied, and Hisui
noticed.  
  
"Ahhh! Marsim. You thought Aoi was very weak even though she's an
SSS-Rank knight, didn't you? I was fooled at first too..."  
  
Mitsui asked with a serious expression.  
  
"Is she strong?"  
"Yes, very. I can't beat her at all... In swordsmanship and
magicules..."  
"It's hard to believe... Her movements are full of openings..."  
Mitsui muttered, shaking his head.  
  
(Hmph, so what! She took Miss Hisui away from us. I'll make her realize
that I'm more suitable to be Miss Hisui's partner!!)  
  
Marsim was firmly determined.  
  
"Even so. Miss Hisui, you've become much stronger, haven't you?"  
"Really? I've learned a lot of new spells."  
  
Hisui looked pleased.  
  
(Moreover, she's become very beautiful... Could she have found a
boyfriend...? I'm worried...)  
  
Marsim didn't like Mitsui's gaze.  
  
"Mr. Mitsui!! You were looking at Miss Hisui with perverted eyes just
now!"  
"No, that's not it!! It's because Miss Hisui has become so beautiful...
I was wondering if she had found a lover."  
  
Mitsui muttered in a faint voice, panicking as if he had been seen
through by Marsim regarding his feelings for Hisui.  
  
"Eh? Miss Hisui, what about it? Do you have a lover??"  
  
Hisui flinched at Marsim's overwhelming spirit. Just then, there was a
knock on the door, and Aoi entered the room.  
  
"Ah, Aoi. Please help me..."  
  
Marsim's intuition worked when she saw Hisui looking at Aoi.  
  
(Ah! Miss Hisui likes this person...)  
  
Marsim was very jealous.  
  
(I'll definitely make her understand that I'm more suitable for Miss
Hisui!!)  
  
Hisui was completely unaware of Marsim's firm, firm resolve.
