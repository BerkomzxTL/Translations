# Chapter 149: The Wind Brigade (3)

That day, Aoi and Hisui were at a bar. A dim, seedy-smelling bar like a
den of evil.  
In the Demon Capital, three dark organizations were currently stirring.
The three had built a delicate balance of power, creating a three-way
standoff.  
The bar where Aoi and Hisui were was run by the Serpent Dragon Society,
the largest organization, and there were constant rumors of illegal
transactions taking place there. It was also said that the boss of the
organization frequented it.  
  
"Aoi, what's with that outfit...?"  
"Oh, I had Marsim choose it for me. Isn't that the case for you too,
Hisui?"  
"That's true, but... somehow Aoi looks cooler..."  
  
Aoi was wearing a blue, tight one-piece dress that accentuated her
figure, along with black fishnet stockings. Hisui wore a black tight
skirt, a white shirt, and a black jacket.  
  
"Ugh, even though it's so flashy... Hisui must have been influenced by
Count Mars..."  
  
Aoi's image of Count Mars was an old man wearing a golden helmet, armor,
and a red and white striped cape.  
  
"Really? I think Count Mars is cool."  
"Hmm."  
  
Aoi, giving a half-hearted reply, called out to the waiter.  
  
"I'd like to order a drink..."  
"Yes, what would you like?"  
"Snake Poison on the rocks. Two glasses, please. I'll pay with Asura
gold coins."  
  
Aoi used a code phrase for purchasing illegal drugs. However, this code
phrase was a dummy released by the Serpent Dragon Society to expose
operatives from enemy organizations. Aoi deliberately used the dummy
code phrase.  
  
"Certainly. Please wait a moment."  
  
The waiter, with a polite bow, went to a plump man sitting in a
semi-private sofa that overlooked the bar and whispered in his ear.  
Several women were attending to the man, and at the end of the line was
Musaba, the vice-branch chief of the Wind Brigade. Aoi and Hisui saw the
man glance at them.  
  
"That's the boss of the Serpent Dragon Society, Gamaliel. Oh, and that
vice-branch chief is there, too..."  
"Do you think the vice chief will notice us?"  
"I don't think so? Well, more importantly, the food here seems
delicious. I don't think they'd poison it, so let's eat."  
"Well, I suppose so. Let's have some."  
  
Just as Aoi and Hisui were about to eat the chicken thighs seasoned with
honey and salt and baked slowly with a knife and fork, the waiter
appeared.  
  
"Dear customers. The owner of this establishment wishes to welcome you.
Would you please come with me?"  
"Hmm, can we eat this dish first?"  
"Madam, that's not possible. Since you made that order, we need you to
follow it."  
  
The waiter's attitude was uncompromising.  
  
"Hmm, it can't be helped. You'll do the transaction properly, right?"  
"Yes, of course."  
  
Ignoring the waiter's reply, Aoi and Hisui stood up.  
  
"This way, please."  
  
The waiter led them to a gloomy, iron-barred room in the basement.  
  
"W-what is this? S-scary."  
  
Hisui couldn't help but laugh at Aoi's poor acting.  
  
"Aaah, I'm scared too."  
  
Hisui also tried to match Aoi's acting, but the monotone delivery made
Aoi grimace.  
  
"This is a room for pampering you spies. If you don't want to get hurt,
be quiet."  
  
The waiter, unaware of Aoi and Hisui's unnatural acting, put shackles on
Aoi and Hisui's hands and feet.  
  
"The owner will be here soon. Hehehe, he's going to love you a lot."  
  
The waiter said, then locked the door and went upstairs.  
  
"Now. What to do with that toad-like guy?"  
  
—  
  
Gamaliel licked his lips.  
  
(Uhehehe, some amazing women have come in. And two of them. I wonder how
I should treat them...)  
  
Gamaliel enjoyed tormenting young, beautiful women. And in cruel ways.
He wasn't very interested when he received the report of someone using
the decoy code phrase.  
He thought he'd just handle it as usual. But, when he glanced at their
captivating beauty, Gamaliel was captivated. And both of them were
beautiful.  
  
"Today is going to be fun."  
  
Gamaliel almost ascended to heaven when he imagined the red blood
crawling on their white skin.  
  
"That's right. That Wind Brigade! It'll be fun to show them off to the
Vice-Chief."  
  
Gamaliel glanced at Musaba, who was drinking at the end of the table. A
mercenary group that had expanded its influence in the Asura Kingdom and
advanced into the Demon Kingdom. It was an organization that Gamaliel
didn't find very interesting. He needed to take them over as soon as
possible.  
  
"Mr. Musaba, let me show you some fascinating entertainment."  
  
Gamaliel planned was to control Musaba  through pleasure and fear.  
Musaba got goosebumps at Gamaliel's sadistic smile. But he barely
managed to reply.  
  
"Thank you, Mr. Gamaliel. I'm looking forward to it."
