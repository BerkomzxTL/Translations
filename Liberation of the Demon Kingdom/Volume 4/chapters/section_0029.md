# Chapter 114: The Power of α Squad (From Marsim's Perspective)

The banquet ended before nightfall. As promised, Aoi healed everyone.  
  
"Oh, amazing. I'm fine now..."  
"Miss Hisui, Miss Aoi doesn't seem to have any magicules at all, how
come she doesn’t run?"  
"Aoi is actually a monster. She has a tremendous amount of magicules
hidden."  
"Whoa there, I heard that, Hisui. Who's the monster?"  
  
Only Marsim was disgruntled as she watched the scene.  
  
—  
  
The next morning. Marsim was regretting joining α Squad.  
  
(W-what is this? Who are these people?)  
  
Everyone is incredibly skilled. Especially the Squad Leader, Mao, a high
elf, is scary. Just plain scary. You can't sense her presence at all,
but she has no openings.  
  
"Hehehe, Hisui. Good morning!"  
  
Mao hugged Hisui and laughed happily.  
  
(How can Miss Hisui keep someone like that under control...?)  
  
Marsim thought as she watched Mao frolic around Hisui.  
  
"Good morning!"  
"Good morning, everyone."  
  
When Aoi appeared with Susano, α Squad became tense. It was like when a
respected superior officer was giving instructions.  
  
(Why? Why are they so nervous around such a carefree commander?)  
  
Moreover, it's Susano.  
  
(What's with that girl too! The amount of magicules is incredible...)  
  
"Marsim, what's wrong?"  
"N-nothing. It's nothing... You all seem very strong..."  
  
Hearing this, Mao sighed and replied.  
  
"We're still far behind. We're nowhere near Miss Aoi or Hisui..."  
"Alright, alright, we're going to subjugate the Flame Dragon, Flail. Mao
scouted it out yesterday. There seem to be about eight Sky Dragons, but
no other particular obstacles. Let's get going!"  
  
Marsim was shocked to hear this.  
  
(Eight Sky Dragons! Isn't that a big deal!)  
  
But what's with these guys! It's like they're going on a picnic! But
Marsim still doubted Aoi.  
  
(She probably lets these guys do the fighting and steals the credit. How
nasty...)  
  
"Marsim, you can't interfere with Aoi when it comes to the Flame
Dragon."  
"Of course not. I don't want to die yet."  
  
They walked for about 40 minutes. Mao warned them.  
  
"Sky Dragons are coming. Eight of them. In three minutes."  
  
(Eh? I didn't notice at all... This girl is amazing...)  
  
Hearing this, Hisui infused the ground with magicules and created a
giant golem.  
  
(Eek, Miss Hisui. When did you learn such a powerful technique...?)  
  
"Okay, Hisui, three of them. I'll leave it to you."  
  
Aoi imbued Dark Cutter with magicules and assumed an iai stance.  
  
"Yes, you can leave it to me."  
  
Hisui answered and said to Mao,  
  
"I'll drop them 20 meters ahead."  
  
Mao nodded and advanced about 10 meters.  
  
"Go, Golem! Rocket Punch!"  
  
Hisui launched the golem's arm, smashing it into the wing of the leading
Sky Dragon.  
  
"Next!"  
  
The golem's arm, which had pierced the Sky Dragon's wing, continued and
pierced the wing of the second Sky Dragon as well, before plunging into
the abdomen of the third.  
  
"Mao!"  
"Leave it to me, Hisui!"  
  
The three Sky Dragons fell in front of Mao. Mao infused magicules into
the space, opened a hole, and transferred his arm to the necks of the
Sky Dragons in a flowing motion, beheading all three with an ancient
dagger.  
And Aoi...  
  
"Haaaah!"  
  
With a spirited shout, she drew Dark Cutter. Multiple layers of black
waves piled up and formed a blade, which sliced the Sky Dragons.  
  
"A, a, a."  
  
Marsim's legs gave out and she fell on his butt. The remaining Sky
Dragons were torn to shreds by the dark blades that Aoi unleashed and
disappeared.  
  
"Mao, you've mastered spatial transfer magic! You could be an assassin
any time you want."  
"Yeah, for Mis Aoi I'd kill anyone except the Spirit Queen!"  
"Oh, okay. Thanks."  
  
Aoi casually replied to Mao, who was smiling innocently.  
  
"Marsim, are you okay?"  
  
Marsim stared tearfully at the area where the Sky Dragons had been. Her
feet were wet from wetting herself.  
  
"Mao."  
  
Mao was given a wink by Hisui, came next to Marsim, and used wind magic
to dry her wet clothes.  
  
"I've been so rude to Miss Aoi..."  
"Hahaha. It's okay. I tried to kill Miss Aoi for real when I first met
her, you know."  
"Indeed. Mao was trying to kill Aoi."※  
  
Hisui faced Marsim and winked.  
  
"See? Aoi is a monster, isn't she?"  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Aoi... Maybe she's too strong...
