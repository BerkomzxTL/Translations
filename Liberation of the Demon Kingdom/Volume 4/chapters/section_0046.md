# Chapter 131: Tsukumi and Amano

7 days since the unsealing. Hisui had returned to the Demon City with α
Squad. Together with Aoi.  
Aoi hadn't regained consciousness since then.  
Dustis and Susano were initially distraught at the sight of Aoi
unconscious, but now they were absorbed in defending the Demon City.  
  
"You don't want Aoi to see the Order of Chaos when she wakes up, do
you?"  
  
Susano also worked hard while assisting Dustis, as if to distract
himself from the sadness. And Hisui...  
Hisui stayed with Aoi the whole time. Believing that she would regain
consciousness.  
The air in the Demon City was clear. The magicules that had been so
thick and dense had cleared, and the air was refreshing. Was the Demon
Continent liberated? No, that wasn't the case. The 7th seal was still
within Aoi, not yet lifted. According to Morse's assessment, this seal
would be completely lifted by Aoi's death.  
  
\*Knock knock knock\*  
  
The door was knocked, and Luca came in.  
  
"Miss Hisui. Let me take over for a bit. Please rest."  
  
Hisui shook her head weakly.  
  
"I see..."  
  
Luca sat down next to Hisui.  
  
"Luca. Don't you think it's unfair? The liberation of the Demon Kingdom
that Aoi wanted so strongly can only be achieved if Aoi dies... I don't
want to accept that..."  
"Of course. I don't want to accept that either..."  
"How is Mao doing?"  
"Yes, she is commanding the mercenary corps with Mr. Bardock and
defending the Demon City."  
  
Hisui nodded.  
  
"I'm being helped by Mao and Bardock..."  
  
Luca shook her head.  
  
"Miss Hisui. That's not it."  
"Eh?"  
"For those who live in the Demon Kingdom, lifting the seal is a
long-cherished desire. And everyone knows that it was only thanks to
Miss Aoi that we were able to get this far.  
We want to achieve the liberation of the Demon Kingdom together with
Aoi. That's why everyone is just doing what they can now."  
"I see. Aoi. Please wake up soon. Everyone is doing their best."  
  
\*Knock knock knock\*  
  
"Hisui. Is it okay?"  
"Mao. Yes, what is it?"  
"Tsukumi, the Commander of the Asura Kingdom's Royal Guard, has
arrived."  
"I understand. I'll go right away."  
"Luca and I will be watching over Aoi, so don't worry."  
"Thank you. I'll be right back."  
  
—  
  
"This is Hisui. Excuse me."  
  
Tsukumi was being shown to Dustis'a private room. The 200 members of the
Royal Guard had used ships to reach the Demon City in about 15 days.  
  
"Hisui, it's been a while. I feel like you've gained a lot of
power..."  
"Commander Tsukumi, it's been a long time. If I've become stronger, I
think it's because I received so much from Aoi."  
"I see. I'm grateful for the golem incident in the Great Forest, the
Dragon Armament, and personally, sending a prosthetic arm to Arcadia.
"  
"No, I'm glad if I could be of help."  
  
And besides Tsukumi, there was one other person next to Dustis.  
  
"Miss Hisui. It's been a while."  
  
Hisui's emotions overflowed when she heard that voice.  
  
"Miss Amano!! Please!! Aoi! Please look after Aoi."  
"Yes, that's my intention. Queen Dustis. Is that alright?"  
"Miss Amano. I would like to ask you as well. I want you to look after
Aoi. Thank you."  
  
Dustis bowed deeply to Amano.  
  
"A queen of a kingdom shouldn't bow her head so casually. I want to help
Miss Aoi just as much as you do. Miss Hisui, please show me the way
right away."
