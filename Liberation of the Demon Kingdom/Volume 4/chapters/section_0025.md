# Chapter 110: Count Mars

The 2nd seal is only one day away. The 2nd Seal is located in a rugged
volcano. A smoking mountain can be seen in the distance. Hisui was
looking forward to meeting the knights of the Mars Territory.  
Aoi was confident that there would be no battle with an Ancient Dragon!
But Hisui decided not to trust Aoi's confidence in that area.  
  
"Hisui seems excited."  
"Yes, because I didn't get a proper farewell with everyone from the Mars
Territory when I came to the Royal Capital. I'm looking forward to
it."  
  
Hisui is now a Demon Kingdom S-Rank knight.  
  
(Will everyone in the Mars Territory recognize me?)  
  
Hisui had some worries. Aoi could see Hisui's feelings from her
expression.  
  
"Hisui has worked hard. You deserve to be an S-Rank knight."  
"Yes, thank you."  
  
α Squad, including Aoi and Hisui, were at the rear of Dustis' knights.
The Demon Kingdom knights marching in formation looked valiant.  
  
"You marched this knight group all the way to the Sugal Plains, didn't
you?"  
"That just means the seal on the Sugal Plains was that strong."  
  
In fact, Aoi, who had undone the curse, needed three years of
recuperation.  
  
"By the way, how are you going to deal with the Ancient Dragon of the
2nd Seal?"  
  
Hisui asked Aoi with a slightly suspicious tone.  
  
"The Ancient Dragon of the 2nd Seal is a Fire Dragon. It's one of the
strongest alongside the Magic Dragon. But I hurt it pretty badly when I
defeated the Magic Dragon a long time ago, so I don't think it will
resist head-on.  
No, no, I'm not letting my guard down. It seems there are many types of
the Fire Dragon as well."  
"Types?"  
"Ah, Salamanders. I guess we'll have to subjugate them. I'll have to
consult with Dustis and Count Mars... I'll make the Fire Dragon obey
with the Dragon's Guidance."  
"Salamanders..."  
  
Hisui became anxious all at once. Will everything be okay... She didn’t
want anyone from the Mars Territory to get hurt, let alone the,...  
  
"Well, we'll have a strategy meeting tomorrow when we join up with Count
Mars."  
  
—  
  
The next day, the Demon Kingdom knights and the Mars Territory knights
joined up in a village near the 2nd Seal.  
  
"Queen Dustis. It has been a while."  
"Count Mars, I thank you for your cooperation this time."  
  
Count Mars' attire consisted of a red and white striped shirt, a blue
breastplate, and a flashy golden helmet.  
  
"Count, you're as flashy as ever."  
  
Count Mars’ face broke into a smile at the voice.  
  
"Lady Aoi!! Is your health better now? And Hisui too!! You both have
become even more beautiful."  
  
Count Mars' exaggerated reaction was like that of a grandfather meeting
his grandchildren after a long time.  
  
"Count. Today we have prepared a small gathering for the two of them and
the Mars Territory knights. Please be kind to me."  
  
  
  
  
Count Mars was overjoyed.  
  
"This is very much appreciated. There are many who wanted to see
Hisui."  
  
Count Mars then changed his expression and asked about the 2nd Seal.  
  
"I heard that you are going to subjugate a Fire Dragon..."  
  
Aoi answered the question.  
  
"Yes. But I have the Dragon's Guidance from Aldey, so I was thinking of
dominating it. Leave the Fire Dragon to us. I want Dustis and Count Mars
to take down the Salamanders."  
"How many are there?"  
"According to reports from the scouts, about 50."  
"That's quite a number."  
  
Aoi peered into Count Mars' face as he pondered.  
  
"Lady Aoi hasn't changed at all... My heart is stirred."  
"You won't get anything even if you praise me. Rather, if Dustis uses
water magic, I don't think they're that difficult an enemy."  
"That's right. The Demon Kingdom knights will handle about 30 of them.
We’ll subjugate the eastern side of this volcano."  
"Then let us entrust the southern slope of the volcano to the Mars
knights. We also have water users."  
  
Hisui was worried when she heard about the 50 Salamanders, but she was
relieved a little by Dustis and Count Mars' confidence.  
  
"Then shall we start the operation at noon tomorrow?"  
"In that case, we will engage the Fire Dragon one hour before that.
We’ll support you after we subdue the Fire Dragon."  
"Yes, that's encouraging. Thank you. Well, I'm going to have a meeting
with the knights. Hisui, I'm looking forward to tonight."  
  
With that, Count Mars returned to the knights' encampment.  
  
"Aoi. You were acquainted with Count Mars?"  
  
Aoi and Dustis exchanged glances.  
  
"Yes. We've known each other for a long time. But, he's still wearing
flashy clothes..."  
"Eh, isn't that normal?"  
  
When Hisui started saying strange things, Aoi strongly denied it.  
  
"No, no, you didn't see anyone dressed like that in the Royal Capital,
did you? Count Mars is special!"  
"I, I see... That's shocking..."  
  
Aoi looked at the depressed Hisui and firmly swore to teach Hisui some
common sense.
