# Chapter 145: Fragment 2

"Good morning."  
  
Early the next day, Misuzu greeted Yorda, the leader of the A-Rank
adventurer team that was going to conduct the investigation of the
ancient ruins with her.  
  
"Good morning. It's a pleasure to be working with you."  
  
Yorda's team consisted of four people: three men and one elf woman. They
were a team with momentum, having recently been promoted to A-Rank.  
  
"I've heard about the sisters Miss Misuzu and Miss Mirai's
accomplishments. I was looking forward to working with you."  
  
Both Mirai and Misuzu gave wry smiles at Yorda's affable words.  
  
"Likewise. We get to work with a team that's been in the news recently.
We have to do our best not to lose."  
  
The six of them shouldered their luggage and began walking towards the
ruins on the outskirts of the town.  
  
"But it's strange that it's been here near the town and no one noticed
until now..."  
  
The ruins that were scheduled to be investigated today were discovered
by chance by a farmer who was cultivating the nearby land. Concealed by
a clever magic circle, the ruins were filled with miasma, and it was
said that those of lower ranks couldn't even enter.  
  
"Well, the fact that an A-Rank team is being mobilized means it's not
ordinary."  
"That's true. Shall we confirm the formation on the way to the
ruins...?"  
  
The elf in Yorda's team was an expert in ruin investigation. Her name
was Marni.  
  
"Just having Miss Marni leading the way is reassuring."  
  
Mirai's words were met with a smile from Marni.  
  
"Yes, leave the traps and such to me. However, I don't know what kind of
monsters are inside. I'm counting on Miss Misuzu and Miss Mirai."  
"Yes, leave it to us. We're actually quite strong, you know."  
  
Everyone laughed at Misuzu's answer.  
  
"Hahaha, with the strongest sisters, we have nothing to fear! Let's
finish the job quickly and have a drink at the bar!!"  
  
Mirai and Misuzu were gradually starting to like these four good-natured
people.  
  
—  
  
"I can definitely feel the miasma, or rather... the cursed energy."  
  
The six of them arrived at the ruins they were investigating in the
afternoon.  
  
"Marni, how is it?"  
"Hmm, yes. An ancient ruin. But it's strange, isn't it? I heard it was
discovered recently... Recently? No, there are traces of entering and
exiting many times decades ago... Before the Great Calamity,
perhaps...?"  
  
As soon as she heard those words, Mirai was struck with a severe
headache.  
  
"Mirai, are you alright?"  
  
Misuzu supported Mirai, who was about to collapse. At that moment, Mirai
felt a strong thought.  
"Dullahan..., ancient demon god..., dark magic..., ugh, my head feels
like it's splitting..."  
"Mirai, Mirai! Someone, healing!"  
  
Yorda quickly performed healing, but Mirai's condition did not change.
However, Mirai's headache suddenly disappeared as quickly as it had
come.  
  
"Are you okay?"  
"Yeah, I'm fine now."  
"Miss Mirai, the name you mentioned earlier is the name of the Pontiff
from the Magic Kingdom era, right?"  
  
Marni asked Mirai suspiciously.  
  
"I think so. Images flowed into my head... Dullahan's extremely evil
ambition..."  
"Wha, what does that... mean?"  
  
Mirai shook her head weakly.  
  
"I'm sorry, I don't quite understand... But there's something in these
ruins. Something evil..."  
  
Yorda shrugged his shoulders and called out to everyone.  
  
"It's no use probing here right now. Everyone, re-check your equipment
and be on your guard. Mirai, do you think you can go?"  
  
Mirai took a deep breath and answered with energy.  
  
"Yeah, I can go. I'm sorry for saying things that made you worried. I'm
fine now."  
  
Misuzu was worried about Mirai.  
  
(I hope nothing happens...)  
  
Misuzu was watching Mirai's back as she walked ahead.  
  
—  
  
It must have been about 5 hours since they entered the ruins. The inside
of the ruins seemed to be much wider than they had thought.  
  
"I wish we could do something about this cursed energy..."  
  
The cursed aura was so thick that Marni was grumbling. It was so strong
that one couldn't maintain consciousness without constantly resisting
it. They could feel everyone's magicules being depleted.  
However, there were no other traps or monsters. Mirai and the others
were advancing deeper and deeper into the ancient ruins, as if being
lured by something.  
  
"We'll run out of mana at this rate. Hey, Yorda! Let's pull back for
now!"  
  
Misuzu had to warn Yorda, she couldn't hold back.  
  
"Big sister, it's still weird here. I think it's a place people
shouldn't come..."  
"A place people shouldn't come?"  
"Yeah... The magicules filling this place are too sinister."  
  
Mirai had been feeling a sticky and unpleasant gaze ever since entering
the ruins.  
  
"That's right. We'll run out of mana if we continue like this. Let's go
back and regroup."  
  
That was when Yorda made his decision. A change occurred in the ruins
that had been quiet until then.  
  
\*Rustle rustle rustle\*  
  
"Mirai! Watch out! Something's coming!"  
  
Mirai immediately drew her sword at Misuzu's warning. She imbued the
blade with light magicules.  
  
"U, uwaaah."  
  
The swordsman next to Yorda disappeared, leaving a scream.  
  
"Ming!! Damn it! Everyone, back to back!"  
  
The remaining five people followed Yorda's instructions and turned their
backs to each other.  
  
"Uwa! No good! We're going to be done for here!"  
"Klein! Calm down!"  
"Yorda! I won't die!"  
  
Klein began swinging his sword wildly, slashing at the darkness
indiscriminately.  
  
"Klein! Fall back!"  
  
\*Rustle rustle rustle\*  
  
When they heard the sound from their feet, countless stone-like
spider-like objects about 1 meter long were crawling around. Golems?!  
  
"Uwaaa!"  
  
Klein ran into the depths of the ruins while stomping on the stone
spiders.  
  
"Damn it! I won't die for nothing!"  
"Klein!!"  
  
Klein circulated magicules throughout his body and enveloped himself in
flames.  
The stone spiders retreated, avoiding the flames.  
  
"Klein! Damn it!"  
"Yorda! Wait, let's just run through this way. Klein can't be saved
anymore!"  
  
Yorda looked shocked at Mirai's words, but quickly made a decision.  
  
"Everyone, run towards Klein!"  
  
Everyone's actions were quick. They ran through the passage where the
stone spiders had retreated. Mirai and Misuzu didn't look back.  
  
"Guuaaa-"  
  
A terrible scream could be heard, but the two didn't look back. They
moved their legs with all their might, as if to shake off the sound.
