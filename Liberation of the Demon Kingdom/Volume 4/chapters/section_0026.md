# Chapter 111: Reunion

That night, Aoi and Hisui were heading to the dinner party arranged by
Dustis.  
  
"Ah, Aoi. I'm a little nervous. I wonder if everyone's doing well?"  
  
Aoi watched Hisui with a smile.  
  
"Ah, that's the mansion over there."  
  
Several knights from the Mars territory were guarding the gate of the
mansion.  
  
"It's been a while. I'm Hisui."  
  
Hisui cheerfully called out to the guards.  
  
"Hisui? It's really you! You've become so beautiful."  
  
The older knight replied happily.  
  
"R-Really? I haven't changed at all."  
"You look like you're doing well! Everyone was sad after the way we
parted!"  
  
The knight took Hisui's hand and squeezed it tightly.  
  
"The Count said, 'We'll have two knights from the Demon Kingdom as
guests today, so be careful not to make any mistakes.'  
Everyone will be so happy to know you're here, Hisui! Come on, this way.
Let's go quickly."  
"Wait, wait a minute. Ahem. This is Aoi, an SSS-Rank knight of the Asura
Kingdom and an SSS-Rank knight of the Demon Kingdom."  
"Huh?? SSS-Rank? Hisui, you're kidding, right?"  
"No, it's true."  
  
The knights remembered that Hisui didn't joke about things like this.  
  
"I-I apologize for my rudeness. Please come this way, I'll show you
in!"  
  
Aoi followed the knights' guidance with a wry smile.

Marsim was bored. It was an exceptional honor to hold a dinner party on
the battlefield.  
She didn't expect a particularly luxurious meal, but she was determined
to eat and drink enough to soothe the fatigue of traveling here with
such force.  
But then, she was summoned by Count Mars and instructed to serve the
knights of the Demon Kingdom with the ridiculous rank of SSS-Rank, along
with Squad Leader Mitsui.  
Right now, Mitsui and Marsim are waiting in the anteroom to greet the
guests.  
  
"Ah, Mr. Mitsui. I'm the unluckiest person in the world..."  
  
Mitsui swallowed the words, "I'm unlucky too," and warned Marsim.  
  
"Hey, if you make that face, they'll know you're unhappy right away.
Smile nicely. And I'm Squad Leader Mitsui."  
"I know that, but I never called Miss Hisui *'Squad Leader Hisui,'*  so
I can't call you * 'Squad Leader Mitsui.'* "  
"Haah..."  
  
Mitsui sighed, but he understood Marsim's feelings all too well.  
  
"I wonder if Miss Hisui is doing well..."  
  
Both of them, no, all the squad members admired Hisui. A little too
serious, kind, responsible, and above all, strong and beautiful Squad
Leader Hisui.  
  
"I hope she's happy."  
  
Marsim nodded emphatically at Mitsui's words.  
  
"Alright, let's get to work. No slip-ups."  
  
Count Mars told them that the guests were SSS-Rank knight Lady Aoi and
an accompanying S-Rank knight from the Demon Kingdom. He said that both
were young women.  
  
(Ugh, but why us...? We don't know any etiquette...)  
  
Count Mars told them not to worry about etiquette because they're not
the type to care.  
  
(But that's not good enough...)  
  
At that moment, the entrance became noisy, and a knight who had been
guarding the gate knocked on the door of the anteroom.  
  
"They've arrived."  
  
(Why is it so noisy? The Count will be angry if he finds out.)  
  
"It's noisy. Is everything alright?"  
"Ah, you'll understand when you see them."  
  
*'What do you mean, you'll understand when you see them?'*  Mitsui
cursed inwardly. Then, the door was knocked on again.  
Mitsui and Marsim stood at attention.  
  
"Thank you for having us!"  
  
The woman who entered was a slender, beautiful woman with light brown
bobbed hair. But her demeanor was full of openings.  
  
"I am Aoi, a knight of the Demon Kingdom."  
"Yes. We've been waiting for you, Lady Aoi."  
  
Mitsui thought she was a beautiful woman, but he was skeptical of Aoi,
who didn't seem strong at all.  
But that was instantly a thing of the past. Because an unexpected person
appeared behind her.  
  
"Miss Hisui!"  
  
Marsim rushed toward Hisui, clung to her chest, and began to cry.  
  
"Waaaaah. Miss-Hizu-suiii."  
  
Hisui caught Marsim and gently supported her back.  
  
"It's been a while, Marsim. I made you worry, didn't I."  
"Hi, hic. M, Miss Hisuiii. Please don't go anywhere again!!"  
  
Hisui had a slightly troubled expression but gently held Marsim close.
