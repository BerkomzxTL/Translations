# Chapter 82: Outlook

"You're still as scary as ever."  
  
Anna landed on the ground and spoke to Aoi, who dispelled all the dark
magic and was now naked.  
  
"Aoi, are you alright?"  
  
Hisui also came to Aoi's side with Mao and released her Dragon Armament.
The Dragon Armament returned to being a single metal plate, and Hisui
became naked.  
  
"Anna! You were having way too much fun!"  
  
Aoi turned around to complain to Anna, and noticed that there were high
elves there. Moreover, there were three male high elves!  
  
"!! D-Did they see?"  
  
Both Hisui and Mao crouched down on the spot. The high elves awkwardly
turned their backs. In that gap, the three jumped into the changing room
and put on their clothes. Aoi, who came out of the hut, said,  
  
"Hisui, Mao. Let's kill them!"  
  
She said something dangerous and was scolded by Hisui.  
  
"Sorry, they came out to protect me. They're gone now."  
  
Anna apologized, but the three were in a daze for a while.  
  
—  
  
That night.  
  
"Aoi, what's the difference between a wind user's spatial manipulation
and Aoi's black hole?"  
  
Hisui asked with sparkling eyes.  
  
"Ah, a wind user's spatial manipulation only works within the same
dimension. So they can move to different places or shift space. In the
case of dark magic, it sends you to a different dimension. Where does
that go? I don't know."  
  
Hisui tilted her head and thought, but,  
  
"Ah, so that's what you mean."  
  
She seemed to understand and was satisfied.  
  
"Why did you bring the wyverns under your control? Wouldn't it have been
faster to just defeat them? You'd already killed three of them."  
  
Aoi grinned.  
  
"If we make them into mounts for the elves, they can keep watch from the
sky, right?"  
  
Hisui nodded in agreement and called out to Mao, who was next to her.  
  
"See, Aoi's thinking about various things, right?"  
"Or rather, why is Mao here?"  
  
Mao intertwined her arm with Hisui's and sat down.  
  
"Mao was embarrassed about flying around naked and wanted to know
why."  
  
Mao nodded in agreement and bowed her head to Aoi.  
  
"Miss Aoi, thank you. It was worth flying around naked."  
  
With that, she waved her hand to Hisui.  
  
"Well then, see you later. Hisui."  
  
With that, Mao cut off her presence and disappeared into the great
forest.  
  
"High elves are scary. I can't sense her presence at all..."  
  
Aoi muttered softly.  
  
"That's right. I couldn't sense those three high elves at all either. I
was so careless that they saw Aoi naked..."  
"Hisui, you got seen too, right."  
"Yes, but I didn't want anyone to see Aoi naked..."  
  
Aoi gently hugged Hisui's head.  
  
"Hisui, you don't use polite language with Mao."  
"Yes, we became friends."  
"Can you... speak that way with me too?"  
  
Hisui looked at Aoi and began to answer with a flustered expression.  
  
"It's impossible. Aoi is that… I, I like you… not as a friend… no, no,
we are friends but it's more like I respect you… or rather, my feelings
show up in my polite language…"  
  
Aoi gently stroked Hisui's head.  
  
"Yeah, I understand, Hisui. We'll be busy again from tomorrow onwards.
Let's go to sleep now."
