# Chapter 78: Mock Battle and the Dragon's Crest

"Hisui! Let's have a mock battle!"  
  
Aoi said this as she handed Yagiri to Hisui.  
  
"Eh? Aoi?"  
"Here I come!"  
  
Aoi drew Nijimaru and immediately channeled magicules into its blade,
releasing a blade of light. However, the blade of light Aoi released was
easily resisted by Hisui. Hisui unsheathed Yagiri, crouched low, and
slid under Aoi's feet.  
  
"Ha!"  
  
From under Aoi's feet, Hisui slashed upwards with Yagiri. It was a
strike too fast for the average person to even see.  
However, Aoi deflected this blow with Nijimaru, using the force of
Hisui's attack to leap into the air.  
In mid-air, she drew Dark Cutter, becoming a dual wielder, and channeled
magicules into both blades before swinging them down. It was a strike
with a terrifying amount of power.  
However, Hisui could see this attack coming. She readied Yagiri and
channeled magicules into the Dragon Armament.  
Then, several invisible walls unfolded forward from the Dragon Armament.
The first, second, and third walls were broken by Aoi, but the final
fourth wall prevented the two sword strikes and was defended by
Yagiri.  
  
"Hisui! That's amazing!"  
  
Aoi sheathed her swords and said. Jim collapsed to the ground on his
rear, his mouth hanging open in shock.  
  
"Y-you two aren't human..."  
"Hey, Jim. Don't call people monsters."  
"G-goddesses..."  
  
Aoi gave a wry smile and looked at Hisui.  
Hisui was dispelling the Dragon Armament.  
  
"Aoi. Thank you very much. I think I can get the hang of it."  
  
Her face was very bright and beautiful.  
  
—  
  
That night, Aldey came to see the Dragon Armament.  
  
"Hisui, you've done a great job creating this in such a short amount of
time. The quality is also excellent."  
  
Aldey said this as he took out a small knife.  
  
"I came here to do this."  
  
As he said this, he stabbed the small knife into the inscription that
Hisui and Jim couldn't analyze.  
  
"Aoi, I can't use light magic. Please activate it for me."  
  
As he said this, he placed the handle of the small knife in Aoi's hand.
Then, Aldey told Aoi how to use the light magic.  
  
"Alright, here I go."  
  
When Aoi activated her light magic, the Dragon Armament turned a deep
purple.  
  
"I've applied the Dragon’s Crest. The Dragon Armament was originally a
Magic Dragon's fang. In the name of the Dragon Knight Aldey, I've
unlocked its true power."  
This was the reason why Aldey was called a Dragon Knight. Aldey could
use light magic to draw out the power of magical beasts called Ryu,
Drakes or Dragons, and control them.  
  
"I can no longer use this power since I lost my light magic. I entrust
it to Aoi. Use it well. It's called Dragon's Guidance."  
  
As he said this, Aldey handed the small knife (Dragon's Guidance) to
Aoi.  
  
"Yeah, thank you. Aldey."  
  
Jim would never forget this day.  
The Dragon Armament, created by Jinrai and whose power was drawn out by
Aoi, was given a new life by Hisui.  
And the Dragon Armament, which had the Dragon’s Crest applied by Aldey,
would demonstrate its power in the hands of Hisui in the future.  
Jim continued to gaze at the Dragon Armament and the figures of the
three people surrounding it, trying to burn this scene into his mind.
