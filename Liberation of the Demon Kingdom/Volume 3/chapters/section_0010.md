# Chapter 77: Dragon Armament

The next day, Aoi poured magicules into the Dragon Armament as Hisui
instructed. The Dragon Armament had been repaired and was disassembled
and lined up.  
  
(Hisui's magicule control is genius.)  
  
"Amazing, Hisui. It's fixed."  
  
Hisui and Jim looked at each other and bowed their heads.  
  
"Actually, there's only one engraving that we don't understand... It
doesn't affect the activation or operation, so we left it as it is..."  
  
Hisui was looking down at that moment, so she missed Aoi's grinning
smile. Then, Hisui raised her face and said firmly.  
  
"Anyway, I'll activate the Dragon Armament. Aoi, please help."  
  
Hisui and Jim checked the parts of the Dragon Armament and performed the
final check. And,  
  
"Aoi, please infuse dark magicules there."  
  
Reacting to the magicules Aoi infused, the Dragon Armament revealed its
power.  
When Aoi began to flow magicules, Hisui, who was standing next to her,
also infused magicules in the same way, fine-tuning the flow of
magicules. The work continued for 3 hours.  
  
"Phew. Aoi. Thank you for your hard work. It's complete."  
"Hisui, your magicule control is genius. I really think you're
amazing."  
"No. But is Aoi okay?"  
"What do you mean?"  
"I'm already exhausted."  
  
Hisui sat down on the spot. What Hisui had done was to collide Hisui's
magicules with the flow of Aoi's enormous amount of magicules to adjust
the position. As a result of this work, dark and light magicules were
balanced in the Dragon Armament.  
  
"All that's left is to engrave it."  
  
Hisui stood up and walked to the front of the Dragon Armament.  
  
"I'll support you."  
  
Jim stood beside Hisui. Then, Hisui gathered magicules in both hands and
held them over the Dragon Armament. The engraving magic was activated.
The Dragon Armament was assembled and revealed its form.  
  
"Aoi, do you want to try it on?"  
  
Aoi had already decided since the day she decided to liberate the Demon
Kingdom with Hisui. Aoi shook her head and said.  
  
"Hisui, I want you to use the Dragon Armament. So you should be the
first to wear it."  
"Eh, is that really okay?"  
  
Aoi looked straight at Hisui and nodded.  
  
"Thank you. Then."  
  
Hisui turned to the Dragon Armament and issued the command necessary for
installation.  
The Dragon Armament covered Hisui's body and revealed its appearance.  
  
"Ohh, it's so cool!!"  
  
The Dragon Armament was more like wearing a golem than armor. It
multiplies the wearer's strength many times and has anti-magic and
impact resistance performance. Moreover, since it generates a
gravitational field, it doesnâ€™t feel heavy, and the joints repel each
other, so the movement is very smooth.
