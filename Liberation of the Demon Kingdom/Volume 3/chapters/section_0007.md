# Chapter 74: Hisui's Feelings and Aoi's Feelings

Anna's banquet was very enjoyable. The weather was nice and warm, so
everyone feasted on freshly grilled meat outside. The meat was wild
bison hunted in the Great Forest.  
It was skillfully prepared and had no gamey smell at all. The herbs used
for seasoning went very well with the meat.  
Drinks fermented and distilled from fruits harvested in the Great Forest
were served. It was very fragrant, and Hisui drank more than when she
danced in the Barlmin territory.  
  
(Ah, it's so delicious.)  
  
Hisui thought so from the bottom of her heart. When she glanced at Aoi,
she saw Anna hugging her from behind. Aldey, noticing Hisui's gaze, sat
next to Hisui and said:  
  
"Elves are a long-lived race. Therefore, they have a low awareness of
loving each other as opposite sexes for the sake of reproduction. So
elven love is directed towards the person they truly love, regardless of
gender. Anna has liked Aoi for a long time."  
  
Hisui understood. Hisui was also attracted to Aoi.  
  
(Maybe the dark magicules are making my lifespan longer too. That's why
I don't feel strange being attracted to Aoi, who is the same gender?)  
  
Hisui smiled at Aldey with a strained face and walked towards Aoi and
Anna.  
  
"Aoi, you look like you're having fun."  
"Oh, Hisui. Sit down with us."  
  
Hisui was invited by Anna and sat next to Aoi. Hisui was also hugged
from behind by Anna.  
  
"Hey Anna, stop it. You perverted elf."  
"Yes, I won't deny that. High elves spend their long lives in young
bodies. But because of their long lifespan, they lack the instinct to
reproduce, so their sexual desire is directed towards enjoyment."  
  
Anna said, while groping Hisui's chest.  
  
"So don't lay a hand on Hisui."  
  
Aoi pulled Anna away from Hisui.  
  
"Here, here, Anna. Want a drink?"  
  
Anna downed her drink with a dissatisfied look on her face.  
  
â€”  
  
Aoi and Hisui entrusted the drunk Anna to her subordinates and returned
to their assigned room.  
  
"Aoi, you're being targeted by Anna..."  
  
Aoi grabbed Hisui's shoulders and said.  
  
"I know. I've been a target for a long time. I've been in danger a few
times. She's troublesome because she has technique."  
  
Hisui grabbed Aoi's shoulders in return and said.  
  
"Eh, technique...? What did she do to you?"  
"No, no, I just misspoke."  
  
Hisui pressed closer to Aoi.  
  
"Lying is bad. Aoi, did she do something like this to you?"  
  
Hisui gently nibbled on Aoi's earlobe.  
  
"Ah. Hisui, a little..."  
  
The words Aoi was about to say were silenced by Hisui's lips. And Hisui
gently hugged Aoi.  
  
"Ah, Hisui..."  
  
"I'm going to be mean to Aoi today. Aoi, you said it was okay to be mean
once we got to the Great Forest, right?"  
  
Then, using earth magic, she created an elastic, rod-shaped object about
6 inches long in her lower abdomen.  
  
"A, ah, wait, Hisui!"  
"I don't want to. I can't wait."  
  
Hisui said as she pushed Aoi down.
