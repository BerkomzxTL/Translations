# Chapter 76: Hisui's Golem Development Log

Afterwards, Hisui and Jim brought the Dragon Armament to the workshop
that was given to them, and secluded themselves there for three days to
research and repair it. It seemed like it'd be helpful in manufacturing
and managing golems, so Hisui and Jim were enthusiastic.  
Naturally, Aoi got bored and wandered around Anna's mansion.  
  
"Oh, Aoi. Just the person I was looking for. We've arranged for a dwarf
craftsman for the golem project. Also, Berg has given permission for
manufacturing and operation. Mr. Saji seems to have worked hard to make
the arrangements. Hisui was happy too."  
"That's good..."  
  
Anna noticed Aoi's slightly lonely demeanor and was puzzled.  
  
"What, what? That's not like you. Are you lonely?"  
"It's nothing like that."  
  
Anna took Aoi's hand.  
  
"Come on, let's go. Let's have some tea."  
  
Anna took Aoi's hand and led her to her room.  
  
"What? Tea? That's not like you."  
  
Aoi asked Anna, a little suspicious.  
  
"Yeah. Does Aoi know how I feel?"  
"Well, yeah, I've been targeted for a long time. It's nostalgic."  
"You're lonely because Hisui isn't paying attention to you, right?"  
  
Anna said this as she offered Aoi some tea.  
  
"Wait, wait, Anna. Yeah, I'm lonely, but I think Hisui is feeling
fulfilled..."  
  
Anna grinned.  
  
"Which one of us is acting out of character?"  
  
Anna said this as she handed Aoi the tea.  
  
"Herbal tea. It'll energize you."  
  
Aoi drank it all in one gulp and looked exhausted.  
  
"How is it? Feeling energized?"  
"Well, so-so, I guess? My tongue is tingling, though..."  
  
Anna stood up and said to Aoi.  
  
"Aoi, you can stay here a little longer. I'm going to go check on the
Dragon Armament."  
  
â€”  
  
The repair of the Dragon Armament was almost complete. Hisui and Jim
were showing a level of magicule control that could be called genius.  
  
"After that, we just need to engrave the dark magicules. However, while
the Dragon Armament is good, if we mass-produce golems, relying on the
dark engraving means that only Aoi or I can do the engraving. I'm
worried."  
  
Hisui frowned and thought hard.  
  
"That's a difficult problem..."  
  
Anna also tilted her head and started thinking. There were said to be
two ways to apply engravings.  
One is for a user with the same attribute as the engraving to be used to
knead in magicules. The other is to use a magical tool with attribute
magic applied to it as a medium.  
In the latter case, regardless of the attribute, the user can imbue
magicules into the magical tool that mediates the magicules.  
  
"Hisui... about that."  
  
Aoi came into the room, looking a little better.  
  
"Aoi, do you have a plan?"  
"I think Hisui can do it, but if I imbue magicules, you can create a
"magical tool" to be used as a medium for golem creation, right? Can't
we use magic stones during the engraving?"  
"Using magic stones is certainly a good idea. Aoi, you almost fell into
a subspace at Marquis Barlmin's mansion, right?"  
"Ah, that was close..."  
"We might be able to apply the combination of engraving magic, magical
tools, and magic stones from that time. That way, we can reduce the
performance degradation when copying."  
  
Hisui had also been considering making a magical tool. However, if a
magic tool is used as a medium, the copied product will inevitably be of
lower quality than the original. Hisui believed that high performance
was necessary for an unspecified number of users to operate the golems.
For this reason, the method of using a magical tool as a medium, which
would result in a decrease in quality during manufacturing, had a lower
priority as an option.  
However, the engraving magic in Marquis Barlmin's mansion was opening a
subspace without any decrease in magicules. Moreover, Hisui had actually
seen that engraving magic at the time.  
  
"Jim, can you work with me a little longer? Also, Aoi. We'll finish the
Dragon Armament tomorrow. Please help me."  
  
Jim took the tools necessary for the engraving to Hisui's place.  
The two began to discuss the magic tool that would be the medium for
golem manufacturing while arranging the tools. Aoi saw that the two of
them looked very lively.
