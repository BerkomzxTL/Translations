# Chapter 72: The True Identity of the Magic Warrior

It took less than an hour to reach Anna's mansion. This was because
Castor was so excited to be flying with Aldey on his back.  
  
"Hey, Castor! Slow down a little."  
  
Castor ended up being scolded by Anna along the way.  
Anna was smiling happily next to Aoi the whole time. Anna touched Aoi's
body from time to time, which made Hisui sulk.  
Anna's mansion was a one-story building, but the grounds were spacious
and the structure was clean and well-ventilated.  
When they arrived at the mansion, Anna led everyone to their rooms.
Hisui, Aldey, and Jim were given their own rooms.  
  
"Aoi, make yourself comfortable in my room."  
  
It was Hisui who objected to Anna's room assignments.  
  
"I'd like Aoi and I to be in the same room for security reasons."  
"What? Are you saying my mansion is dangerous?"  
  
Hisui and Anna glared at each other.  
  
"Aoi, what do you want to do?"  
"Aoi, what do you want to do?"  
  
Aoi looked troubled and said,  
  
"U-Um. I, I think I'd like to be with Hisui?"  
  
She said while looking at Hisui's face.  
Hisui looked happy, but when Anna glared at her, she immediately
tightened her expression.  
  
"I guess that can't be helped. But let's talk later, just the two of
us."  
"More importantly, Anna, Aoi and Hisui have come to receive the Dragon
Armament. Is it possible?"  
  
Anna immediately answered Aldey's question.  
  
"Aoi broke it."  
"What! Aoi, is that true!"  
  
Aoi looked at Aldey with a look of dismay, but quickly looked away. But
Aldey questioned Aoi further.  
  
"How could that thing be broken? I see! Is that why Aoi wasn't wearing
the Dragon Armament when she fought Luke!!"  
"Well-, I guess I was in top form back then?? I charged Dark Cutter with
magicules and when I released it, it burst into pieces."  
  
Aldey held his head in his hands.  
  
"I see! That makes sense. That's why Jinrai was adjusting Nijimaru so
carefully before the battle with Luke!"  
"Hehehe."  
  
Aoi gave a strained smile at Aldey's dumbfounded face.  
  
"Huh, wasn't the Dragon Armament used by the nameless magic warrior? Aoi
was using it?"  
  
Hisui asked Aoi, seemingly surprised.  
  
"What? Didn't Hisui know? The nameless magic warrior is Aoi."  
  
Aoi's face became even more strained, and she looked at Hisui.  
  
"Eh? But. Isn't the magic warrior supposed to be male? And even the age.
Eh?"  
  
Aoi scratched her cheek and looked up at the ceiling.  
  
"Aoi may look young, but she has a lot of life experience..."  
  
Hisui was reminded of her conversation with Aoi after the fight with
Vegas.  
  
*'I told you before that Luke didn't age. I'm the same.'*※  
(Ah, Aoi... she said she was the same.... She said she was 20 when we
first met.... ※※ But it's probably better not to ask about her age...)  
  
"I see! That's why the magic warrior in the picture of the Six Heroes
that was decorating Aoi's house was drawn so small!"  
"That's right. Dustis drew that picture. It was a good picture, wasn't
it?"  
  
Aoi was proud.  
  
"But why is it that the magic warrior is supposed to be male?"  
"That's because the magic warrior was originally Buenos. He was
fascinated by Luke..."  
  
Aldey replied sadly.  
  
"Yeah, the magic warrior is a fictional warrior created by mixing Buenos
and me..."  
  
Jim felt very awkward being in this place.  
  
(Is it okay for me to hear this story??)
