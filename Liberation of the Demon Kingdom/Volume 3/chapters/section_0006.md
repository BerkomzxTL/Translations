# Chapter 73: Dragon Armament and Golem Ideas

"This is the Dragon Armament."  
  
It was in the room Anna led them to.  
  
"A metal plate with engraved magic? Mithril, I think. Aoi, what is
this?"  
"Fufu. This, you see, is used like this."  
  
Aoi took the metal plate and channeled magicules through it. Then, armor
appeared from the metal plate and covered Aoi's body.  
  
"Amazing. It's floating around Aoi."  
  
The Dragon Armament wasn't something to be worn, but floated around the
body.  
  
"That's right! It's not heavy. Dark magic that adjusts the gravitational
field is engraved on it."  
"But, it's tattered."  
"Yeah, sorry."  
"Why is this so dense and hard... and it seems to have anti-magic
properties... why is this armor in such a sorry state?"  
"Yeah, sorry."  
  
Aoi shrunk back and scratched her cheek.  
  
"It can't be helped! Jim, let's repair it together!"  
  
Anna looked surprised.  
  
"I can't just casually entrust the magic armor made by Jinrai to you."  
"Anna, Hisui is fine. Hisui! Show it to her. My statue."  
  
For a moment, Hisui made a strange face, but immediately took out Aoi's
statue from her backpack. The nude statue!  
  
"H-Hisui! That's not..."  
"What is this! It's wonderful!!"  
  
Anna snatched the statue from Hisui and observed it as if licking it all
over. Aldey looked troubled, and Jim was blushing bright red and looking
down.  
  
"Wait a minute. This isn't it... Ah, Hisui!"  
"No! I understand. I'll entrust the Dragon Armament to you. This is the
same as Jinrai's magic."  
  
Anna slowly bowed her head to Hisui.  
  
"Would you mind giving this statue to me?"  
  
This offer was immediately rejected by Aoi.  
  
—  
  
Anna was unable to take countermeasures against the kidnappings, mainly
demi-humans, occurring on the border between the Barlmin territory and
the Great Forest.  
  
"If we detect a large amount of magicules, the high elves guarding the
border will defend, but we're still drastically short of personnel. The
situation in the Barlmin territory is similar, right?"  
  
Anna asked Aldey.  
  
"Well, that's right."  
"In that case, I have an idea."  
  
Everyone looked at Hisui.  
  
"How about having golems guard the border? If you'd like, Jim and I will
make them..."  
  
Anna saw potential in Hisui's proposal.  
  
"Hisui, can you mass-produce them? Can they be maintained after you're
gone? Can we operate them?"  
  
She asked a series of questions.  
  
"First, mass production and maintenance can be done by Jim even if I'm
not here. And... are there any earth magic users in the Great Forest?"  
"The dwarves are good at earth magic... yes."  
  
Anna chose her words carefully while thinking.  
  
"Then, we might be able to form a manufacturing and maintenance team
centered around Jim."  
  
Anna nodded repeatedly.  
  
"We need magic stones to move them automatically, but the Barlmin
territory is a land where magic tools are actively manufactured. If you
can purchase them from the caravans active in Barlmin, they'll also
transport them. If you want to ask a caravan to purchase them, I can
introduce you to Onjin's caravan. They require a user to control them,
but they’re easy to operate."  
  
Anna opened her eyes wide and looked at Aldey.  
  
"We need the cooperation of Marquis Barlmin. Since it affects the
balance of the army we have to get Berg's permission. Aldey, what do you
think?"  
  
Aldey listened with his arms crossed, but asked Jim.  
  
"Jim, what do you think? Can you do it?"  
"Yes! Please let me do it!"  
  
Aldey smiled broadly and replied to Anna.  
  
"I'll talk to Berg and Barlmin."  
  
Then he looked at Hisui and bowed his head.  
  
"Hisui, this matter is related to weakening the Order of Chaos and
stabilizing the situation in the Demon Kingdom. I humbly ask for your
help."  
  
Aoi watched the situation unfold with a smile, but inwardly she was
proud.  
  
(As expected of my partner.)  
  
Anna stood up and looked around at everyone.  
  
"I'm counting on you from tomorrow onwards. Especially Hisui. Don't put
too much burden on yourself. I've prepared a banquet for today. Let's
eat and drink to our heart's content!"
