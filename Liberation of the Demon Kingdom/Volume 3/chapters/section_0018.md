# Chapter 85: Night in the Great Forest

Five days later.  
Hisui created a manual for everything from the manufacturing,
maintenance, and operation of golems with the dwarves, high elves, and
elves.  
Additionally, several earth users were dispatched from the royal capital
to the Great Forest. It would be reassuring to have them able to work
with Jim and the dwarves.  
There was also contact from Barlmin territory that a caravan dealing in
magic stones would be heading to the Great Forest. It seems Onjin and
Marquis Barlmin did their best. Golems were also mobilized to escort the
caravan. Some elves, including Mimi and her group, volunteered for the
escort mission.  
In particular, Mimi's tribe was skilled at handling wyverns, and their
skill was recognized even by Aldey.  
Anna was adjusting the Elven Gate. This gate was the culmination of
spatial magic passed down from ancient elves. When a wind user who can
even manipulate space operates it, it can transfer the target to any
desired location in the world. There was a restriction that the
coordinates would not be fixed unless someone of elven blood was
included in the transfer. Apparently, the user can to teleport to the
desired location using special elven vibrations as a marker  
It was said that if there were no elves, they would not know where to
transfer and would get lost.  
  
"Aoi, please come again."  
  
Anna gently placed her hand on Aoi's shoulder, looking lonely.  
  
"Yes, after I liberate the Demon Continent, for sure."  
"Hisui, thank you for everything. You two have to come."  
"Yeah, for sure."  
  
—  
  
Tomorrow was the day they would leave the Great Forest.  
That night, a grand farewell banquet was held for Aoi and Hisui. Fruit
brandy, honey wine, and wine fermented and distilled from apples
harvested in the Great Forest were served.  
Many races living in the Great Forest, including Mimi and the elves,
were serving their proud ethnic dishes.  
The elves served simple and deep soups and salads made with wild herbs,
the dwarves served wild dishes with meat grilled in a bold manner, and
the ogre tribe served rustic stews of meat and root vegetables. Aldey
also served dishes with river fish stuffed with herbs and grilled over a
net.  
  
"Anna, thank you. It's so much fun."  
  
Hisui was surrounded by dwarves and high elves and couldn't get away.
She was always in the center of the circle, smiling.  
  
"Aoi, you're willing to risk your life when it comes to Luke, aren't
you? That's the only thing I'm worried about."  
  
Anna muttered while looking at everyone's cheerful appearance.  
  
"Right now, Hisui is here, so… I can't do something like that…"  
  
Anna expected Aoi to say "I won't" after that, but Aoi didn't say
anything more.  
  
"Well, that’s fine. Just make sure you come back here."  
  
Anna was thinking about Dustis in the Demon Kingdom while looking at the
starry sky with Aoi.  
  
(She's the type to take on other people's feelings too... so don't do
anything reckless, you two.)
