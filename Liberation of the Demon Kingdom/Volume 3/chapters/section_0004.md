# Chapter 71: Spirit Queen Anna

Aoi went around healing the injured high elves. The high elves seemed to
have no intention of fighting anymore and were quietly waiting by
Basil's side. Except for Mao.  
Mao didn't take her eyes off Aoi's movements, ready to attack at any
chance. Hisui glared at Mao.  
  
"Miss Hisui, your eyes are scary."  
  
Hisui, called out by Aoi, created a mini-lem and filled it with
magicules so that she could suppress Mao at any time.  
  
"Yes, I'm ready to go at any time!"  
"No, no, Miss Hisui. That's not what I meant..."  
  
Jim was observing the mini-lem next to Hisui.  
  
(Miss Hisui is always wonderful!)  
  
Aoi watched the master and disciple with a dumbfounded look.  
An hour later, a young dragon flew out from the depths of the forest.
The high elves were truly surprised to see its back.  
  
"Your Majesty!"  
On the dragon's back was Anna, the Spirit Queen.  
  
—  
  
"Anna!"  
  
Aoi shouted and ran towards the dragon.  
  
"Aoi!"  
  
Anna jumped off the dragon and hugged Aoi.  
  
"Aoi, I missed you..."  
"Me too! You haven't changed, Anna."  
  
Anna had pointed ears, a slender body, and a beautiful face, looking
about the same as a human in her twenties.  
  
"Oh, Aldey’s here too!"  
"I came as an envoy of Barlmin. Duke."  
  
Aldey answered formally, but Anna snorted at him.  
  
"Hmph, what's with Duke? Just call me Anna."  
  
Anna said as she slapped Aldey on the shoulder. The high elves were
surprised by this exchange.  
  
(Her Majesty looks so happy. And she's allowing him to call her by her
name!)  
  
"So? I think there's a reason for this.... It's hard to talk here. About
five people can ride on "Castor" to my mansion, but what do you want to
do?"  
  
The dragon Castor had been wanting to get closer to Aldey, but stood
upright when Anna called its name.  
  
"Hey hey, Castor. Long time no see. Has Anna been bullying you?"  
  
Aldey gently stroked Castor's neck.  
  
"Aldey is as rude as ever. Should I drop you from the sky?"  
"Anna, I'd appreciate it if you could carry us. Can you bring the Gamou
birds and horse lizard?"  
"Basil, can you do it?"  
  
Basil stood upright and answered Anna's question.  
  
"Yes! Understood."  
  
(Gamou birds are fine, but is this strange creature going to be okay?)  
  
Basil was worried inwardly.
