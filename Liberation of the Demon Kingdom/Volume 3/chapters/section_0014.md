# Chapter 81: Dragon Rider Raid

The sky in the direction Aoi pointed suddenly cracked open, and many
wyverns appeared.  
  
"Dragon riders!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui immediately readied the ancient daggers they had placed
nearby. Mao also readied the dagger she had placed next to the spring.  
  
"There are 5 dragon riders and 15 wyverns including the riders."  
  
Mao said as if shouting.  
  
"Oh, my, my. What a wonderful sight."  
  
One of the dragon riders showed a vulgar smile.  
  
"You're all beautiful. What are you going to do naked against so many
wyverns? Hahaha, ladies! I'll take good care of you!!"  
  
Hisui activated her Dragon Armament. The magic armor covered Hisui's
body.  
  
(What! Her important parts are hidden!)  
  
Anna inwardly clicked her tongue in disappointment.  
  
(But it is a suggestive outfit...)  
  
Although Hisui's important parts were hidden, her chest, thighs, and
stomach were exposed, which, depending on how you looked at it, made it
more arousing than being completely naked.  
  
Aoi drew her dagger and swung it once.  
  
"I'll play with you with this today."  
  
Aoi concentrated magicules, and her important parts were covered in
darkness, hidden in the perfect position.  
(Tch, even Aoi!)  
  
Anna clicked her tongue again in disappointment. But,  
  
(Well, this is attractive in its own way...)  
  
Aoi's important parts were barely visible, but almost everything else
was exposed.  
Aoi activated dark magic and floated into the air. Gravity manipulation.
While floating, she glared at the dragon riders, holding her dagger.  
  
"Come!"  
  
One of the dragon riders rushed in, spewing flames, but it was easily
resisted, and Aoi slit his throat as they passed each other, killing him
instantly.  
  
"Mao, slash all the wyverns with this!"  
  
Aoi threw the Dragon's Guidance to Mao.  
  
"Mao, ride on me!"  
  
Hisui put Mao on her shoulder and jumped up vigorously.  
  
"Wait a minute. Arenâ€™t I the only one completely exposed?"  
  
Mao shouted, but Hisui didn't stop. She restrained two wyverns with
earth magic, immobilizing them.  
  
"Mao, now."  
  
Mao reluctantly jumped out of the magic armor completely naked and
slashed the wyverns with the Dragon's Guidance. Because Mao was leaping,
Hisui could see everything about her. And so could Anna.  
  
(Yeah, Mao is pretty wonderful too.)  
  
Anna was watching the battle alone, looking happy.  
  
"Hisui, please! Don't look at me!"  
  
Mao pleaded with Hisui while following Hisui's guidance, slashing one
wyvern after another.  
  
"Mao, that's impossible. Look, next! Here we go."  
  
Hisui resisted the flames spewed out by the wyverns and passed by their
sides.  
  
"Aah. This is embarrassing!"  
  
Mao shouted, but continued to slash the wyverns one after another.  
  
Aoi was surrounded by four dragon riders. The wyverns spewed flames at
the same time and rushed towards Aoi. She gathered dark magicules in her
right hand and created countless small orbs of darkness.  
  
"Hmph!"  
  
The dark orbs scattered around with Aoi's fighting spirit.  
  
"Hahaha. What kind of magic is this...?"  
  
But that dragon rider soon lost consciousness after that. Because the
head that touched the dark orb vanished. The dragon rider became only a
body and fell to the ground. The other two were the same. The parts that
touched the dark orbs disappeared, and they died instantly. The wyverns
that touched the dark orbs also died and fell to the ground.  
  
"So, what will you do?"  
  
Aoi asked the remaining dragon rider.  
  
"Not yet, there are still many wyverns left."  
"Is that so?"  
  
Aoi weaved light magicules and activated the Dragon's Guidance. Then the
wyverns that Mao had slashed became docile and followed Aoi.  
  
"What! What are you?"  
  
Aoi glared at the remaining dragon rider and gathered dark magicules in
her right hand, pointing it at the dragon rider.  
  
"Answer me. How did you get here?"  
"I don't know! I was just sent here by Lord Vegas' spatial transfer
magic!"  
"I see. Vegas is a wind user?"  
"Yes. You won't stand a chance against him, you'll be dropped into the
dimensional rift."  
  
Some of the highest-ranking wind users can manipulate space. Anna is one
of them. She could manipulate space, transferring or cutting objects
along with the space.  
  
"I see. Vegas can manipulate space..."  
  
Aoi activated the dark magic that was gathered in her right hand.
Supergravity was generated around the dragon rider, crushing only the
dragon rider. The crushed object fell into another dimension.  
  
"You fall into the dimensional rift..."  
Aoi muttered and dispelled the gravity field, landing on the ground.
