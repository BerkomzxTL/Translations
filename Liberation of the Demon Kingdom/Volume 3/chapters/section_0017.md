# Chapter 84: You’re Working Too Hard

In fact, the golems that Hisui and Jim created were very
high-performance. They also synchronized well with the High Elves, and
the tests went smoothly.  
  
"Hehehe, how is my Hisui?"  
"Honestly, I'm amazed. That magicule control is amazing. I don't like
that she loves you so much though."  
  
In fact, the Great Forest security plan using golems was progressing
smoothly. The number of golems made by Jim and the dwarves had also
increased to five. Maintenance was being taught to the dwarves, mainly
by Hisui, and the golems were now at a level where they could be used
without any problems.  
  
"Hisui, can I have a word?"  
  
Hisui, who was stopped by Aldey, hurried over.  
  
"Is there something I can do for you?"  
"No, I heard that Hisui was preparing a prosthetic arm for Arcadia..."  
  
Hisui smiled and looked back at Aldey.  
  
"I, or rather, Aoi was saved by Arcadia. In exchange, Arcadia lost his
right arm... I want to repay him for that."  
  
Aldey was impressed by Hisui's straightforwardness.  
When Hisui gestured, Jim brought over the "right arm" that had been
prepared. It was made of mithril and was a very high-performance
prosthetic arm that mimicked the Dragon Armament.  
  
"Lord Aldey, would you please give this to Arcadia?"  
  
(Hmm. It mimics the Dragon Armament... This girl may be comparable to
Jinrai...)  
  
Moreover, Hisui's feelings were completely pure. Aldey wanted to convey
those feelings to Arcadia.  
  
"Hisui. I understand. I’ll attach this prosthetic arm to Arcadia myself.
It's wonderfully made!"  
  
Hisui was relieved. The feeling of being recognized by the Dragon Knight
Aldey filled her heart with joy.  
  
"Lord Aldey. Thank you very much."  
  
As she said that, Hisui's consciousness sank into darkness.  
  
"Miss Hisui!"  
  
Hisui thought she heard Jim calling her name, but she couldn't answer.  
  
—  
  
"Hisui, you’re working too hard."  
  
Aoi performed healing on Hisui and looked worriedly at her face.  
  
"Yes, I'll be careful..."  
  
Aoi held Hisui's hand. Hisui must have relaxed the moment Aldey
recognized the prosthetic arm. She fainted from anemia due to
exhaustion.  
  
"I'll hold your hand today, so rest well."  
  
(Ah, I feel safe when I'm with Aoi after all.)  
  
Hisui slowly closed her eyes. The gentle breeze blowing in from the
Great Forest felt soothing.  
  
"Aoi, I was worried. The Order of Chaos' attacks are increasing, right?
If we go to the Demon Continent, we won't be able to protect everyone...
That's why I wanted the power to protect everyone from the Order of
Chaos... I wanted Jim and everyone in the Great Forest to live in
peace..."  
  
"Yes, Hisui is doing her best. That golem is wonderful. Everyone in the
Great Forest can operate it. Aldey’s also teaching the elves how to ride
the wyverns we caught the other day. The people of the Great Forest
won’t lose to the Order of Chaos. They’ll get stronger."  
  
"Fufu, that's right. Everyone is doing their best..."  
  
"That's right. So Hisui doesn't need to work harder than necessary."  
  
"Aoi. Five more days. Please give me some time."  
  
Aoi nodded.  
  
"I understand. We’ll leave for the Demon Continent in six days. In six
days, I’ll have Anna prepare the "Elven Gate." Speaking of which, Mao
said she would come to the Demon Continent with us."  
  
Hisui rose up from the bed with those words.  
  
"Eh, Mao is!"  
"You seem happy. Yes, apparently an elf must accompany you when using
the Elven Gate. Basil was originally scheduled to go with us, but Mao
really wanted to go."  
  
Hisui smiled happily.  
  
"Hehehe. I see. Mao's coming too."  
Seeing Hisui's reaction, Aoi pinched Hisui's cheeks with both hands.  
  
"What's wrong? I'm getting jealous."  
"Aoi, I'm sorry! I mean, it hurts..., please don't pinch me so hard."
