# Chapter 86: Farewell

**Last chapter of volume 3, The Great Forest**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Jim felt very lonely.  
  
(Tomorrow, I'll be saying goodbye to Miss Hisui...)  
  
Jim wanted to go with Hisui and the others on their journey, but Jim had
things he had to do now. Things only Jim could do. He was filled with
gratitude to Hisui, who discovered this and gave him the opportunity.  
  
"Miss Hisui... Thank you so, so much..."  
  
Jim's face was wet with tears.  
  
"Jim, I should be the one thanking you. Things wouldn't have gone so
smoothly without you."  
  
Hisui took Jim's hand and shook it firmly.  
  
"Jim, please take care of the Great Forest."  
"Yes! Miss Hisui."  
  
Jim couldn't say anything more and continued to shed tears.  
  
"Boss, Jim is a capable guy. We like Jim too. We'll work hard
together."  
  
Hisui nodded firmly at Giml's words.  
  
The elves danced and the dwarves sang. Aldey was also showing off his
wonderful singing voice. Aoi started singing along to Aldey's song with
Anna. The night of the banquet deepened. The excitement continued until
the morning without cooling down.  
  
â€”  
  
Aoi and Hisui tied their luggage to Kamo and Gamo. The horse-lizard,
Artesia, was given to Mao thanks to Aldey's kindness. Mao immediately
tied her luggage to Artesia.  
  
"Well then, I'm off."  
"Everyone, we're leaving."  
  
Aoi and Hisui smiled in front of everyone who came to see them off.  
Jim still had a tearful face.  
  
"Aoi, don't be reckless."  
  
Aoi took Aldey's warm words to heart.  
  
"Yeah, thank you."  
"Aoi, it's about time."  
  
When Anna called out, Aoi, Hisui, and Mao each mounted their rides. Anna
opened the elven gate.  
  
The three advanced to the gate. Their figures were enveloped in light
and gradually disappeared.  
  
"Miss Hisui!! I'll protect the Great Forest!! Please come back
safely!"  
  
Jim shouted in a loud voice. As the light of the gate faded, his voice
gradually became fainter and fainter to Hisui and the others.
