# Chapter 75: This! I can repair this.

(Guh, Hisui dominated me all night long yesterday. My back is killing
me...)  
  
When Aoi woke up, Hisui was already gone, and a note was left behind.
The note said that she was going to check out the Dragon Armament with
Jim.  
Aoi roused her languid body and went to the dining room to eat
breakfast. Anna was waiting for her.  
  
"You had quite a bit of fun yesterday, didn't you?"  
"Wh-..."  
  
Aoi's face turned as red as a summer tomato.  
  
"I could hear Aoi's voice. *'Hisui, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna
come again~'* and stuff like that."  
"Ah–, what's the big deal? That's right. It was fun!"  
"Awww, I'm so jealous."  
  
Ignoring Anna's grinning face, Aoi started eating her bread, salad, and
fried egg.  
  
“Hisui. That girl is really Aoi's other half, isn't she?"  
  
Aoi glared at Anna and swallowed the bread in her mouth.  
  
"That's right. So don't you dare lay a hand on her."  
"I won't. I like Aoi better anyway."  
  
Anna smiled seductively and left her seat.  
  
"Are you leaving already?"  
"I'm busy. I have a meeting with the dwarves about the golems. If I get
a good response, I'll introduce them to Hisui."  
  
Anna waved her hand and left the dining room.  
  
"Hmph, whatever..."  
  
Aoi snorted and devoured the rest of her breakfast.  
  
—  
  
Hisui was observing the metal plates of the Dragon Armament with Jim.  
  
"This is the first time I've seen dark engraving magic. It's similar to
light engraving."  
"That’s true. But it has a unique shape. Like here..."  
  
Jim had a memory of seeing this shape somewhere. He couldn't remember.
Certainly this shape...  
Hisui tried to infuse magicules into the metal plate. The engraved magic
glowed, and the Dragon Armament appeared.  
  
"Miss Hisui! The part that glowed just now! It was only the same part as
the light engraving. Could you please put it back again?"  
  
Hisui was perplexed by Jim's question.  
  
"Jim, this. How do I return it to its original state?"  
"Fufufu. Did you call for me?"  
  
Jim reacted with a start to Aoi, who suddenly appeared.  
  
"What's wrong? Jim. Is it that surprising?"  
  
Jim's face was bright red.  
  
"J-Jim! By any chance, did you overhear yesterday?"  
"Yes..."  
"!!!"  
  
—  
  
After that, Aoi recovered and taught Hisui how to return the Dragon
Armament to the metal plate.  
  
"Here! Remove the magicules from this mark. Then..."  
  
The Dragon Armament returned to the metal plate.  
  
"Miss Hisui, please look at this."  
  
When magicules were infused into the metal plate, a light engraving
appeared.  
  
"I see!"  
"Miss Hisui, I understand. This is because Mr. Jinrai overlapped the
light engraving onto the engravings he had been writing down in his
engraving collection!"  
"Ah! That's right! I have that collection with me."  
  
Hisui took the "Jinrai Engraving Collection" out of the bag she always
carried and showed it to Jim.  
  
"It's around these markings here. Ah!"  
  
Hisui recalled the time when she first met Aoi.  
  
"Aoi! You used light magic to deflect my Yagiri. Could you show me and
Jim that magic?"  
"Eh? Sure."  
  
Aoi drew Nijimaru and infused it with magicules.  
  
"Miss Hisui! I'm sure this is it!"  
  
Hisui and Jim held hands and jumped for joy!  
  
"Umm... what does this mean?"  
"Yes, this Dragon Armament is a composite of light and dark engraving
magic. The light engraving is mainly the *'repulsive'* magic that Aoi
just showed us, and the dark engraving is the *'gravity field'* magic
that Aoi showed off at Barlmin. These are *‘combined’* to create the
inscription. I see, by using repulsive force to move the joints
smoothly, and manipulating the gravity field to make it feel weightless.
This! I can repair this!"  
  
Aoi was overwhelmed by Hisui, who was talking so fast, and could only
nod.  
  
"The shape of the magical armor is also well thought out. But this metal
can't be shaped without Lord Jinrai's method of kneading magicules. It's
very hard and flexible! And it's also highly dense. What is this
metal?"  
"Umm... This is... the fang of the Magic Dragon Jaswan that lived in the
Demon Kingdom... or rather..."  
"Ehhh, Magic Dragon Jaswan is said to be an incredibly strong ancient
dragon that could destroy a country. That fang is... what do you
mean?"  
"Umm... I pulled it out... something like that..."  
"Pulled it out?"  
"I defeated it... something like that..."  
  
Hisui looked at Aoi with a look of utter exasperation on her face.  
  
"What?"  
"No, it's nothing. Please don't do such reckless things anymore."  
  
Aoi nodded silently.
