# Chapter 70: High Elf

The group entered the forest along a path. As expected, the elves were
familiar with the forest. They proceeded without hesitation. They
encountered monsters several times, but were able to repel them without
difficulty.  
  
"We will enter the domain of the Spirit Queen in about half a day."  
  
It was several hours after Mimi's declaration that they felt the
anomaly.  
  
"Aoi, we're surrounded."  
"Aldey, as expected of you. I had no idea."  
"I can manipulate magicules themselves, so I have good sensitivity. But
I don't know the exact location."  
  
Even the elf wind user didn't seem to be able to sense that they were
surrounded.  
  
"It's dark magic, but I'm going to try using it. Everyone, it will be a
little harder to move."  
  
As Aoi said that, she deployed a gravity field centered on herself.
Everyone in the area where Aoi deployed the gravity field felt their
bodies getting heavier.  
  
"Aoi, how is it?"  
"Yeah, there are 11 people. What should we do? Should we try to capture
one?"  
  
The ones surrounding Aoi and the others were a race called high elves.
They were under the command of the Spirit Queen Anna. They were acting
out of caution against intruders into the Great Forest's domain. If
there was no hostile action, they intended to simply observe without
interfering.  
  
"There is someone using dark magic!"  
  
For the high elves, dark magic was a detestable power that the Magic
Kingdom, which perished 500 years ago, had developed and used to destroy
itself. Because of their long lifespans, this fact was ingrained in the
high elves as a memory, not just a record.  
Moreover, they had apparently seen through their concealment using wind
magic and grasped their location. The high elves were terrified.  
  
And because of that fear, one of the high elves went berserk. It was a
young female high elf among them.  
With a short sword in hand, she moved at tremendous speed through the
trees and slashed down at Aoi from above.  
Aoi drew Nijimaru and deflected the blow that came from above. The high
elf kicked off the tree trunk with the force of the deflection and
attacked Aoi again.  
She flashed her sword, aiming for Aoi's abdomen. Aoi evaded the attack
with a backstep and created lightning in her left hand, striking the
high elf. The high elf took the full force of this attack and was
paralyzed.  
  
"We have no hostility! I want you to let us meet Anna."  
  
As Aoi said that, she held up the Sakura Crest pass.  
  
However, there was no particular reaction. Hisui muttered,  
  
"As I thought, that pass isn't known at all..."  
  
She said with dissatisfaction.  
  
"It's no good... it’ll be a battle. Hisui, Aldey, don't kill them. Mimi,
focus on defense while retreating."  
  
Hisui and Aldey quietly drew their swords.  
  
—  
  
The high elves were trembling.  
  
(Mao was defeated so easily...)  
  
Mao's technique as a user was immature, but her physical ability was
high, and she had a reputation for swordsmanship.  
  
(We'll attack all at once with magic from a distance!)  
  
Basil, the leader of the high elf squad, made that decision and gave
instructions to his subordinates.  
The high elves quietly and quickly distanced themselves from Aoi and the
others. Magic was unleashed, mainly targeting Aoi. Wind and water became
a violent storm.  
Aoi jumped to Hisui's side and resisted.  
  
"Hisui!"  
  
At Aoi's call, Hisui created three mini-lems and sent them running in
the direction Aoi indicated.  
  
"Hisui, now!"  
  
The mini-lems that had started running exploded at Aoi's shout. The
fragments of the mini-lems were incapacitating the high elves.  
  
"Six people down!"  
  
In the meantime, Aldey had struck three high elves with the flat of his
sword.  
Basil was horrified. To think that the squad could be incapacitated so
easily!  
  
"We've lost. Please spare the lives of my subordinates."  
  
Basil appeared from the shade of a tree and abandoned the sword he was
holding.  
  
"No, no, we have no intention of fighting either. We just want to meet
Anna."  
"No, but that is..."  
"Anna! You're watching, aren't you? It's Aoi. I've come to get the
Dragon Armament back!"  
  
Aoi shouted to the sky and turned back to Basil.  
  
"Can we wait a little while until there's a response?"
