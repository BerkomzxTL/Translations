# Chapter 83: Let’s Make a Golem

Days passed since the attack at the spring. Hisui and Jim decided to
operate with 20 golems.

Hisui had created 2 golems earlier. They were 3m tall, made of iron, and
the entire body was rust-proofed.  
One of them had a light engraving that repelled at the joints, allowing
it to move smoothly, and by manipulating the gravity field with a dark
engraving, its weight was reduced to about 1/3. The operation was
programmed to move according to the orders of a person who synchronized
their thoughts, making it very advanced.  
Hisui and Jim planned to use this golem as a base to mass-produce the
remaining golems.  
  
"Mr. Giml, can you and Jim work together to shape the golems?"  
"Yes, Boss. There's no problem with that. I'll finish them properly."  
  
Hisui estimated that with Jim's earth magic and the dwarves' support,
the raw materials for 18 golems could be prepared in about a month.  
  
"The only thing left is how to apply the engravings..."  
  
Jim, receiving Hisui's gaze, brought out a palm-sized statue. It was
made of mithril and looked exactly like Aoi. Though it was fully
clothed.  
  
"I'll use this as a medium."  
  
The statue of Aoi had intricate light and dark engravings, and more than
anything, the statue was holding a very powerful magic stone in both
hands.  
  
"Mr. Giml, can you watch the procedure?"  
  
Saying so, Hisui and Jim placed the base golem in the center of the
circle drawn on the workshop floor, and arranged magic stones around it.
Then, they placed the golem in front of the circle.  
  
"Here we go."  
  
Hisui placed the "Aoi Statue" in front of the formation and poured in
magicules. The circle amplified the magicules with the magic stones and
gathered the magicules into the golem’s body. Light and dark engravings
were then applied to the golem.  
  
"!!"  
  
Giml and the other dwarves watched the scene with their mouths open.  
  
"Phew. It's over. It worked out well."  
  
After that, Hisui was bombarded with questions by the excited dwarves.
Hisui, who was in the center of the circle, looked very radiant from
Aoi's perspective.
