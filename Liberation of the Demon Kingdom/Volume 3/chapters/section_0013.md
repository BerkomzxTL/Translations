# Chapter 80: At the Spring

"Ah, I'm going, I'm going! I want to take a bath."  
  
Aoi, who had been making a fuss, was the first to agree. According to
Aoi, there is a high elf settlement in the Great Forest where very pure
magicules permeate the air, and there's a clean, warm spring.  
  
"It's a very beautiful place, you know. The food is delicious, and there
are lots of flowers blooming."  
"No one said I was taking Aoi. I'm inviting Hisui."  
  
Aoi started making a fuss again, but Hisui and Anna deliberately ignored
her.  
  
"Yes, I'd love to go."  
"Okay, now that that's decided! Mao, are you there?"  
"Yes, Queen. I'm here."  
"Oh, you scared me. I didn't notice you at all..."  
  
Mao appeared from a tree about 10 meters away from where Aoi and the
others were.  
  
"Mao, let the high elf village know that we're bringing guests."  
"Yes, ma'am."  
  
Mao immediately used wind magic to start some sort of communication.  
  
"Queen, would you like to ride Castor?"  
"That's right. Then let's go with Mao too."  
  
Mao immediately brought in the dragon, Castor.  
  
"Um, are you going to take me with you?"  
"Of course, I am. Come on, let's go."  
  
Hisui watched Aoi, who had started to smile happily, with a warm
smile.  
  
—  
  
The high elf village was about an hour’s ride by Castor. Mao held the
reins of Castor, and Aoi and the others relaxed in the back.  
  
"Have we arrived yet?"  
  
The high elf village, seen from the sky, was dotted with houses with red
roofs, and its construction harmoniously blended with the forest.  
  
"We'll go to the place with that steam."  
  
With that said, Mao brought Castor down, landing near the spring.  
  
"It's really a nice place. You can take a bath."  
"How about it? Want to get in right away?"  
  
There was a clean hut next to the spring, and apparently, they would
take off their clothes there. Aoi and Hisui immediately took off their
clothes and entered the spring.  
  
"Ahh, no matter how many times I come here it's always good."  
  
The water was gentle and not too hot, and felt good on the skin.  
  
"Has Aoi ever been here?"  
"Yeah, a few times."  
  
While Aoi and Hisui were relaxing, Anna and Mao took off their clothes
and stepped in.  
  
"This child, Mao, is afraid of Aoi, you know."  
  
As soon as Anna entered the spring, she spoke teasingly, as if to blame
Aoi.  
  
"No, Miss Aoi. I don't fear you, I respect you."  
  
Anna spoke to Mao as if she were dumbfounded.  
  
"Aoi is just a musclehead who sloppily blasts out big spells, you
know?"  
"What do you think you're saying! You!!"  
  
While Aoi and Anna were fighting, Mao spoke to Hisui.  
  
"I'm really sorry for my rudeness the other day. It’s the first time
I've ever taken the initiative to attack and lost."  
  
Hisui chuckled and raised both hands.  
  
"I’m no match for Aoi at all either. We're the same."  
  
Mao also chuckled, drawn in by Hisui's smile.  
  
"Let's both do our best to get one over on Aoi."  
"Yeah, I'll do my best too. Let's have a mock battle next time. Miss
Hisui also seems very strong."  
  
Hisui nodded lightly.  
  
"Hisui is fine. No "Miss". I won't use titles with Mao either."  
"Yeah, nice to meet you, Hisui."  
  
Hisui and Mao happily reached out and shook hands.  
  
"Oh, they're still fighting."  
"Yeah, Mao. I'm going to stop them."  
  
Hisui approached Aoi and Anna and began to mediate. Mao watched the
scene with amusement. At that moment.  
  
"Aoi, what is that?"  
"A large-scale spell is being cast! Anna, it's over there!"
