# Chapter 79: Hisui and the Dwarves

The next day, a group of dwarves accompanied by Anna came to Hisui and
Aoi. By the way, Aldey and Jim seemed to have gone for a walk in the
Great Forest as if today was their day off.  
  
"What! I was told by the Spirit Queen to come here, and this little girl
is our boss?"  
"Oh, so Giml judges people by their appearance?"  
  
Giml was momentarily taken aback by Anna's cold words, but he
immediately continued.  
  
"Then I want you to show us some skills that will convince us."  
"What did you just say! This guy. Hisui, let's kill him."  
  
Aoi was making a fuss, but Hisui remained calm.  
  
"Geez. Aoi is so violent. It can't be helped."  
  
With that, Hisui put magicules into the ground and created a golem. Its
size was 8m. Giml and the other dwarves opened their mouths in
amazement. Then Hisui operated the golem and showed its power to the
dwarves.  
  
"Okay, a somersault!"  
  
The golem did a flip in the air and landed in front of the dwarves.  
  
"Okay. Boss! We recognize you as our boss. Sorry for my rude remark."  
"It's good if you understand. Good if you understand!"  
"Why is Aoi looking so smug...?"  
  
Hisui, feeling exasperated with Aoi, greeted the dwarves.  
  
"I am Hisui, an A-class knight of the Asura Kingdom's Intelligence
Department. And this..."  
"I'm Aoi. Nice to meet you."  
  
The dwarves knelt on one knee, bowed, and replied.  
  
"We're making magic tools in the Great Forest with the permission of the
Spirit Queen. I'm Giml, the representative. Boss, we look forward to
working with you."  
  
â€”  
  
After that, the dwarves went to put their luggage in the residence
prepared by Anna. Anna was watching the turn of events with interest,
but she was inwardly surprised to see Hisui's overwhelming magicule
control.  
  
"Hisui is amazing. That magicule control is probably as good as
Dustis'."  
"No, I don't think I can win against Aoi..."  
"Basically, all Aoi does is put in a lot of magicules and blast them
away. I've never seen her use delicate techniques!!"  
"Grr! How can you not understand the greatness of my skills! Are your
eyes blind!!"  
  
Aoi started to make a fuss, but Hisui and Anna ignored her.  
  
"Hisui, thank you for the golem matter starting tomorrow."  
  
Anna put on a serious face and bowed her head.  
  
"No, no, I also learned a lot, and it's for the sake of protecting the
children."  
"By the way, I think I'll be busy again starting tomorrow, so why don't
we relax today?"  
  
Anna showed a mischievous face.
