# Chapter 68: Sky Dragon and Elves

**Volume 3: The Great Forest**  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The four of them departed from the capital city after noon. They planned
to reach the Great Forest in 10 days. Hisui rode on the front of Kamo,
with Aoi behind.  
  
"Hehehe. Hisui smells good."  
"What are you saying so strangely! I'll shake you off."  
  
On the first and second days, the weather was good and they made good
progress on their journey. On the third day, near dusk after noon, it
appeared as they were preparing to camp in a plaza along the road.  
  
"Dragon?"  
"That's a Sky Dragon. Rare. It's in a battle."  
  
About 800m ahead, within the forest, a Sky Dragon was fighting someone.
The light magic could be seen, so it seemed to be fighting against a
human.  
  
"Aoi, shall we go?"  
"Yeah, let's go! Jim, wait here with Aldey."  
  
Hisui gently instructed Kamo to run. Kamo understood Hisui's intentions
and dashed into the forest.  
  
"It's quite big."  
  
The Sky Dragon was about 5m in size from head to toe. It flapped its
wings and flew around in the air.  
  
"Elves!"  
  
The ones fighting the Sky Dragon were 10 elves. They were trying to
shoot down the Sky Dragon by covering their arrows with wind magic, but
they couldn't hit it because the Sky Dragon's resist was stronger.  
  
"We're knights of the Asura Kingdom. How about we cooperate?"  
  
The elves glanced at Aoi and Hisui and replied,  
  
"We can't break through the resist! We would like your help."  
  
One of the elves used large-scale wind magic to create a tornado around
the Sky Dragon.  
  
"Fall!"  
  
However, the tornado dissipated due to the Sky Dragon's resist. The Sky
Dragon created a mass of air and fired it at the elf who used wind
magic. Aoi immediately resisted and protected the elf.  
Hisui infused magicules into the ground and created a golem the same
size as the Sky Dragon, 5m.  
  
"Aoi, watch this! It’s a Golem Punch!"  
  
As the golem aimed its hand, the part from the elbow onward flew towards
the Sky Dragon. The golem's hand broke through the resist and destroyed
the Sky Dragon's wing.  
  
"Ooh. Hisui, that's amazing. Ah. It's falling."  
  
The golem pinned down the Sky Dragon that fell to the ground.  
  
"Now! Finish it!"  
  
The elves put wind magic into their arrows and shot the Sky Dragon's
head. The Sky Dragon, shot in the head, let out a cry and stopped
moving.  
  
"Great user. We thank you for your assistance."  
  
The elves knelt before Hisui.  
  
"No, no, I'm glad everyone is safe."  
  
Hisui answered while dispelling the golem.  
  
"We’ve come from the Wolun Forest. We were a small village of 20 people,
but we lived happily for hundreds of years. But in the last few months,
we’ve been kidnapped by humans and our population has halved."  
  
Hisui whispered to Aoi.  
  
"That Order of Chaos?"  
  
Aoi nodded and asked the elf.  
  
"What are you all going to do now?"  
"We’re going to the Great Forest to seek protection from the Spirit
Queen."
