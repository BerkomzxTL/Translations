# Chapter 17: Cleaning Up

The bridge near the central square was about 200 meters from the
Knights' garrison. Hearing the commotion, patrolling knights rushed over
immediately.  
  
"Call Tsukumi right away."  
  
When Aoi told the knight who had rushed over, the knight became
furious.  
  
"By Tsukumi, do you mean Commander Tsukumi?! How dare you call her by
name without her title! What insolence!"  
  
Aoi silently thrust forward a pass bearing a cherry blossom crest.  
  
"M-my apologies! Hey, contact Commander Tsukumi immediately."  
  
Tsukumi arrived right away. And immediately upon arriving, seeing the
man Aoi had taken down, she asked,  
  
"Miss Aoi, what did you do?"  
  
"The magic sword shattered."  
"Yes, it did. Miss Aoi, you went too far."  
"Ugh, sorry. I didn't realize it would be so fragile."  
"Indeed, the magic sword I fought felt much more powerful."  
"An inferior version, then. But still a significant threat. Does the
fact that magic swords can be made mean there are dark users
involved?"  
"Yes, if we examine the sword fragments, we might understand the
engraving method. Perhaps it's a copy inscribed using an original."  
  
Naturally, all eyes turned to Aoi.  
  
"L-like I said, I'm sorry!"  
"Well, what's broken can't be helped. Does it look like we can figure
out these men's identities? From their fighting style, I suspect they
might be knights."  
"We'll start the interrogation now, but it looks like it will take
time."  
"Tsukumi, we're heading back. We're departing tomorrow, so we want to
get some rest. Arcadia has the travel schedule. Ah, right. We can also
use the Intelligence Division's carrier pigeons. Let us know if you find
anything out."  
"Understood. Very well. Please leave the rest to us."
