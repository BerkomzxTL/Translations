# Chapter 4: The Royal Castle

"Hisui, make sure you bring your sword."  
  
Hisui was wearing gray pants and a jacket borrowed from Amano yesterday,
while Aoi wore a slightly short navy blue skirt and a white shirt.  
  
"A sword with this outfit?"  
"That's right! Because we're knights."  
  
It's true that knights wear swords. However, they usually do so while
wearing the uniform of their unit.  
  
"The Intelligence Division doesn't have a set uniform, you know."  
  
Hisui, though a little hesitant, strapped her favorite rapier to her
waist. Aoi also had two swords hanging from her waist.  
  
"So, Miss Aoi, you carry two swords."  
"Basically, just one. One is a spare. I carry two because it would be
troublesome if one broke."  
  
The swords Aoi carried were unique. One emanated a very strong power.  
  
(A magic sword. Ahh, I really want to pick it up and take a look. But,
it doesn't feel like it has an attribute enchantment. Maybe it's so it
reflects the owner's attribute?)  
  
Normally, magic swords possess one of the attributes: fire, water,
earth, wind, light, or darkness. Therefore, a magic sword without an
attribute is rare.  
  
(The other one... I don't feel any power from it. Maybe it's a normal
sword? But it's a sword that feels like it has a tense aura.)  
  
"Well then, shall we depart?"  
  
The Asura Kingdom. 150 years have passed since the first King Asura
founded the kingdom. The current King Berg is the 7th monarch. The
kingdom is governed by eight lords holding peerages, with the King at
the top, each managing their own territory. Count Mars is one of them.
The north connects to the Demon Kingdom via a narrow corridor, and the
south is covered by the Great Forest ruled by the elves. The High Elf
who oversees the Great Forest, Anna, one of the Six Heroes, holds the
title of Duke but is not a lord. They maintain a form of autonomy.  
The royal capital of Asura is located roughly in the center of the Asura
Kingdom, facing the sea. The climate is temperate; even at its hottest,
summer reaches about 30°C, and winter lows are around 10°C. Snow rarely
falls. As a key transportation hub, its port and stagecoach services are
well-developed. The population is about 500,000. Commerce thrives
here.  
  
"Wow, so many people! It's like a festival."  
"Well, it was nighttime yesterday, and we didn't pass through the town
center."  
  
The two walked through the market, which was bustling with preparations
for opening. Colorful vegetables and fruits, meat, and fish overflowed,
and customers looking for breakfast were browsing the food stalls.  
  
"The fish sold here are different from the ones up north."  
"That's right. Since it's a port town, the fish are delicious too."  
  
The two left the market and emerged into an area selling tools and
clothes.  
  
"Let's buy some clothes on our way back."  
"But I don't have any money..."  
  
Hisui had been sent to the hospital with only the clothes on her back,
so the only belonging she had was her pass, the proof of her
knighthood.  
  
"That's true. Your luggage is supposed to arrive tomorrow, though. Let's
have the Intelligence Division pay for the clothes! A uniform is
necessary. Since the Intelligence Division's uniform is everyday wear,
the Intelligence Division should pay for it."  
  
Certainly, if the Intelligence Division wore a set uniform, they would
stand out far too much.  
  
"Haa..."  
  
Hisui replied weakly. She wasn't sure if it was okay to use the
Intelligence Division's money, but since her squad leader said so, it
was probably fine. More importantly, Hisui, who had spent all her time
training in a remote region, had no sense of fashion.  
  
"Hisui, you have a great figure and you're beautiful. I'll pick them out
for you. It'll be rewarding to choose, I'm looking forward to it."  
"Thank you very much. I don't know much about clothes, so that's a big
help."  
  
"There are a lot of weapon shops around here. It's because the royal
castle is nearby, so there are many knights and soldiers."  
"The truth is, I love magic swords. I really want to touch Miss
Aoi's."  
"O-oh. Some other time."  
  
Aoi tried to hide her magic swords from Hisui's sparkling eyes.  
  
"Ah, Miss Aoi. You just tried to hide your swords, didn't you?"  
"We'll stop by the weapon shops on the way back, so please spare me for
now..."  
  
—  
  
Immediately after passing through the weapon shop district, they arrived
in front of the royal castle's main gate.  
  
"This is it."  
  
Saying that, Aoi tried to enter an unbelievable place.  
  
"Miss Aoi, this is the royal castle."  
"Yep. When you talk about royal cuisine, this is the place, right?"  
"No, well, that might be true, but..."  
  
Aoi confidently strode up to the royal castle's main gate and thrust a
pass at the gatekeeper. It was a pass designed with a six-petal cherry
blossom motif. There were no words written on it.  
  
"Please let us through."  
  
With a bright smile, Aoi attempted to pass through the gate.  
The stunned gatekeeper quickly came to his senses and said,  
  
"Missy, what is that? You can't enter without identification and an
appointment letter."  
"Ehh? But I was told this pass lets me go anywhere I like. Check with
your superiors. Tell them Aoi is here."  
"No, no, missy. You can't get through with this. If I check with my
superiors over something like this, I'll be the one getting yelled
at."  
  
The gatekeeper said, his voice filled with exasperation.  
  
"No, no, that's not true! This is a really prestigious pass."  
"Even if you say so... If I can't let you through, I can't let you
through."  
  
For a while, Aoi kept insisting, but the gatekeeper stubbornly refused
to listen. Realizing it was futile, Aoi turned to Hisui for help.  
  
"It can't be helped. Hisui, show him your identification and the
appointment letter."  
"The identification is fine, but..."  
  
Though confused, Hisui presented her identification to the gatekeeper.  
  
"A B-Rank knight from the Mars territory. This young lady is quite
something."  
  
Behind her, Aoi was clamoring, "I'm amazing too!" but Hisui deliberately
ignored her.  
  
"Here is the appointment letter."  
"You should have handled this from the start, miss."  
  
A furious screech could be heard from behind, but Hisui ignored this as
well.  
  
"Miss, this is an appointment letter from Captain Tsukumi of the Royal
Guard, but it's for tomorrow. I still can't let you through."  
  
"What did you say?!" Aoi protested, but the gatekeeper's decision
remained unchanged.
