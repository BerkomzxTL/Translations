# Chapter 26: Time for Two

Aoi had no memory from that point on. When she woke up in the morning,
she was in bed, being held by Hisui like a child.  
  
"Ouch. I have a headache, and I feel sick..."  
  
Aoi immediately cured her hangover with healing magic and then
reconfirmed the situation.  
  
(I've changed into my nightgown. Did Hisui dress me? Ah, but it feels so
good. Soft and reassuring. And it smells so nice.)  
  
Aoi wanted to feel Hisui's softness a little longer. Trying not to wake
Hisui, Aoi brought her head to Hisui's chest and buried her face in it.
Then she took a deep breath.  
  
"Ah... it smells so good."  
"But Aoi smells strongly of alcohol!"  
  
Hisui's cold voice came from above.  
  
"Miss Hisui, good morning. How long have you been awake?"  
"Since Aoi started healing."  
"Well, it's just that Hisui smelled so good..."  
  
Hisui interrupted Aoi, who began to make excuses.  
  
"It's okay with me."  
"Huh?"  
"I said it's okay with me! Yesterday, Aoi pressed her chest against Gam.
That's not okay! You can't do that to a man. Maybe if Aoi finds a good
person in the future, she might do something like that... No, no, that's
still not okay. It makes me sad, so please don't do that..."  
"Okay, Hisui. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful."  
  
Aoi apologized honestly, overwhelmed by Hisui's vehemence.  
  
"I-It's good if you understand."  
"But, it's okay with Hisui, right? Can I stay like this for a little
longer?"  
  
Aoi said, looking up at Hisui with a slightly spoiled voice.  
  
"Y-yes, thatâ€™s fine, but don't do anything weird."  
"Yeah, I understand. I won't do anything weird, so let me stay like this
for a little longer."  
"Aoi, you're hopeless. Just a little bit, okay?"  
  
Hisui hugged Aoi's head, praying that this moment would last a long
time.
