# Chapter 2: The Royal Capital

Royal Capital  
  
Spring, Year 506 of the Bres calendar, Asura Kingdom Royal Capital  
  
Hisui had been drowsy for several days. In a dreamlike state, hovering
between consciousness and unconsciousness.  
  
(Marsim is crying. Did she get hurt somewhere? Squad Leader Zilba looks
awful. Covered in wounds. For a B-Ranker, crying because his wounds
hurt… he has no grit.)  
  
Within her hazy consciousness, Hisui vaguely looked around her
surroundings. But her awareness sank back into darkness once more.  
  
"Just rest for a while."  
  
She thought she heard a gentle voice, but she couldn't reply.  
  
—  
  
An energetic woman's voice came through.  
  
"It's fine! I'm just going to check on her!"  
"Miss Aoi, please don't. She's still barely conscious!"  
  
(Where am I? What am I doing?)  
  
Hisui's consciousness was gradually returning. An unfamiliar ceiling,
unfamiliar walls. Bit by bit, her memories came back.  
  
(I ran out of magicules and lost consciousness. And then... Vice
Commander Fuselnia carried me away...)  
  
Hisui abruptly sat up and called out to the two women who were arguing
right beside her.  
  
"Where is this place? How many days have I been asleep?"  
"Oh dear, Miss Aoi was being so noisy, you woke up."  
"Hey, what do you mean, noisy?"  
"It's been a week since you were brought here, Miss Hisui. Ten days
since the battle. How are you feeling?"  
"Yes, my head still feels heavy, but I'm alright. Where is this?"  
"This is a hospital managed by the Royal Capital's Intelligence
Division."  
  
Hisui suddenly felt anxious.  
  
"The Royal Capital? This is the Royal Capital?"  
"I have some letters for you."  
"Ah, thank you."  
  
Hisui accepted three letters from the female doctor.  
Glancing warily at the other woman who had been called Aoi, Hisui broke
the seals on the letters and checked their contents.  
  
"Assignment orders, in His Majesty Berg's name!!"  
  
For some reason, the woman was looking down at Hisui with a smug
expression.  
  
"You are hereby assigned to the Intelligence Division's Aoi Squad."  
"I'm Aoi. I'm 20 years old. Let's get along from now on."  
  
Aoi was slightly shorter than Hisui. Her body was toned and muscular
rather than slender. Her face was more cute than beautiful. Her bobbed
hair gave her an active impression. However, her movements seemed full
of openings; she didn't give off a strong aura.  
  
"W-what does this mean?"  
"It's exactly what it says. Aren't the details written in the letter
from Count Mars?"  
  
Hisui hastily scanned the letter from Count Mars. It mentioned the
Count's concern for Hisui's well-being, how everyone in the Mars Knight
Order, especially those in Hisui's squad, regretted not being able to
say their farewells, and that Hisui had been transferred to the Royal
Capital by direct order of King Berg.  
  
"It says to ask Miss Aoi for details."  
"Hisui, you survived a fight against a very troublesome individual. The
information gained from that is immense. We'll talk more later, but I
believe this matter will affect the course of the world. So I want you
to join me in fighting the Order of Chaos from now on."  
"The Order of Chaos. I heard that they were behind that bandit group.
What significance did that battle have? I was completely outmatched by
that swordsman."  
"No, just coming up with the idea of hitting that cursed sword with two
spells is amazing in itself. In any case, you've been summoned,
right?"  
  
Prompted, Hisui realized the other letter was a summons from Royal Guard
Commander Tsukumi for questioning.  
  
"It's a summons to the royal castle in two days, right? I'll accompany
you. I expect there will be a detailed discussion about the Order of
Chaos then."  
  
With that, Aoi turned to the female doctor.  
  
"Hisui, this is Doctor Amano. She's an officer in the Intelligence
Division."  
"I expect we'll be working together for a long time. I'm Amano. Nice to
meet you, Miss Hisui."  
"Yes, please take care of me."  
  
(Working together for a long time in the Intelligence Division...)  
  
Hisui replied, sounding bewildered.  
  
"Miss Amano, Hisui hasn't eaten in ten days! It's time she was
discharged from this gloomy place, right?"  
"Gloomy... No way. Just because she's had healing applied doesn't mean
she's in perfect condition."  
  
Aoi casually approached Hisui and placed a hand on her forehead. Aoi's
hand glowed faintly, and Hisui felt the weariness leave her body. At the
same time, she was struck by an intense feeling of hunger.  
  
"Amazing..."  
  
Hisui had never received such powerful healing before.  
  
"Miss Amano, you cast a pretty strong sleep spell, didn't you? Took
quite a bit to dispel it."  
  
Hisui remembered. Before falling into a deep sleep...  
  
(I thought I heard a gentle voice.)  
  
"The reason you felt sluggish was because of Miss Amano's sleep spell.
I've healed you, so you're fine now. Let's go to my place."  
"But."  
"Aah. Miss Aoi, you're impossible. I'll file a report, but please don't
push her too hard."
