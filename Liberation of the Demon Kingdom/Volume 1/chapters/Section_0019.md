# Chapter 19: Near the Royal Capital

Spring, Year 506 of the Bres calendar, near the Royal Capital  
  
"Hisui, let’s just follow the highway straight to Marquis Barlmin's
territory!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui were riding two Gamou birds, traveling along the
highway.  
  
"Yes, we should reach the checkpoint in about 10 days."  
"The weather's nice, feels great. At this rate, it looks like we'll
reach Bennel Village by evening."  
  
The first day of their journey went smoothly. They arrived at Bennel
Village, their first stop, a little earlier than planned and secured
lodging at a cozy inn that had a large bath. In the Asura Kingdom, inns
generally came equipped with baths and taverns, though the quality
varied. The two dismounted their Gamou birds and led them to the
livestock shed next to the inn.  
  
"Thank you for your hard work."  
  
Hisui gently stroked its feathers.  
  
"We'll be counting on you tomorrow too."  
  
Several small merchant caravans were staying at the inn, seemingly
exchanging information in the dining hall.  
  
"We're transporting magic stones to the Barlmin territory. Good quality
ones arrive from the Demon Kingdom at the Royal Capital's port, so we
buy those up for business."  
"Yeah, Barlmin’s territory has lots of workshops making high-performance
magic tools. But you'd better be careful. There's a rumor going around
about bandits appearing in the forest areas of the Barlmin territory
lately. I heard several caravans have been hit. Do you have guards?"  
"Yeah, we've hired two users."  
  
Aoi and Hisui listened intently to the conversation they overheard.  
  
"Bandits, huh. Are those two over there the users?"  
"It seems so."  
  
Where Aoi was looking, there were two boys about 15 years old.  
  
"Those guys are no good."  
"I think so too."  
  
There was no doubt they were users, but one's magicules were clearly
unstable, showing poor control just by looking, and the other's
movements were full of openings for someone who wielded a sword.  
  
"I find it strange. Miss Aoi, at first glance, you seem to have even
more openings than they do. What's that about?"  
"Hmph, it's the secret technique mastered by the strong."  
"If you're just going to joke about it, then never mind."  
  
Aoi responded, placating the pouting Hisui.  
  
"I'm curious about the bandits, and I want to see the village, so let's
go check out the trading post."  
"I'll go if you treat me to something sweet."  
  
Aoi took Hisui's hand and stood up.  
  
"Oh well, can't be helped, this Miss Aoi will treat you."  
  
The trading post was a small building. Since the Royal Capital was
nearby, it seemed they only handled the bare minimum for currency
exchange and information provision. There was no information about the
bandits either.  
  
"But you can't underestimate firsthand information from the caravans.
Let's be careful during our journey. We also found out about a shop
selling delicious sweets, so let's buy some snacks, head back to the
inn, take a bath, and then have dinner."
