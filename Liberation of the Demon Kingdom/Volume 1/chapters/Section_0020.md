# Chapter 20: Bath and Peeping.

The two decided to take a bath before eating dinner. When Aoi told the
innkeeper they wanted to take a bath, she was told the bath was already
filled with hot water. Apparently, many guests liked to bathe before the
evening meal. The two immediately grabbed towels and daggers and headed
to the bath. They couldn't carry their swords, but they hid the daggers
just in case. They undressed together in the changing room.  
  
"Hisui, you have such a nice figure."  
  
Indeed, Hisui had long limbs, a slender yet muscular body, and breasts
that, while not large, were beautifully shaped. Her buttocks were firm
and springy.  
  
"St-St-Stop it, please. It's embarrassing. Miss Aoi has a great figure
too!"  
"Though my breasts are bigger than Hisuiâ€™s."  
  
Aoi also had a beautiful figure. Her well-proportioned breasts featured
pretty pink nipples pointing pertly upwards, her buttocks were round and
well-shaped, and her legs were thick. Above all, her toned abs, free of
any excess fat, were stunning. Hisui found herself captivated once again
by the splendor of Aoi's naked form.  
  
"What about you, Hisui? Don't stare like that."  
  
Aoi's words brought Hisui back to her senses.  
  
"S-Sorry. You're just so beautiful."  
  
As Hisui replied bashfully, Aoi gently hugged her.  
  
"Shall we wash each other?"  
  
She whispered in her ear. Hisui was impressed by the smooth, almost
clinging texture of Aoi's skin, but Aoi's words made her blush.  
  
"N-N-No way! I'm getting in first."  
  
Smiling at Hisui's reaction, Aoi followed after her.  
  
"Wait up, Hisui! I was just kidding!"  
  
Soaking in the tub felt like it melted away the fatigue of the past few
days.  
  
"Ahh, a big bath is nice and relaxing."  
"I liked the bath at your house too, Miss Aoi."  
"That bath is small, though. We couldn't get in together."  
"W-Well, that's true, but..."  
  
Aoi grinned at Hisui's reaction.  
  
"Wh-What is it!"  
  
"Nothing, just thinking how cute Hisui is."  
  
Hisui, unsure how to react, turned her back to Aoi.  
  
"Miss Aoi!"  
"Yeah, I know. This is peeping, isn't it? There's absolutely no killing
intent."  
  
While soaking, the two had sensed someone's presence.  
  
"It's those two young bodyguards, isn't it?"  
"Looks like it. Shall we kill them?"  
"What a violent thing to say, Hisui."  
"Then what should we do?"  
"Let's give them an eyeful!"  
"Wh-Wh-What are you saying! No! Absolutely not!"  
  
Aoi gave Hisui a smirk, then stood up, heading towards the door where
they sensed the presence. Stark naked, without even a towel.  
Hisui scrambled to stop her, but it was too late.  
  
"Nooo! No one but me is allowed to see!"
