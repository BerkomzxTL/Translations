# Chapter 12: Demon God of Chaos

Year 1 of the Bres calendar, Capital of the Magic Kingdom (later the
Demon Continent)  
  
"Are you going to be late today?"  
  
Mirei asked Luke while preparing breakfast.  
  
"The activation of the sigil begins today. There'll probably be a
drinking party with the Magic Knights."  
  
For the past few years, Luke had commanded the Magic Knights and devoted
himself to inscribing a sigil across the entire capital to protect it
from plagues. And today, at the Magic Kingdom's Founding Festival, its
activation would begin.  
  
"Mirei, your illness will surely get better too."  
  
Luke and Mirei were scheduled to have their wedding ceremony after the
Founding Festival.  
  
"My body is so weak, I just keep making you worry, don't I?"  
"No, that will surely end today too."  
  
Luke was proud of the sigil's installation. He had poured his heart into
it for those suffering from illness—no, for the frail Mirei. Today, that
effort would be rewarded.  
  
"Well then, I'm heading out. Tomorrow's my day off. Let's go eat
something delicious."  
  
—  
  
The Magic Kingdom prospered. The study of magic developed, magical tools
abounded, and people lived convenient and affluent lives.  
For travel, teleportation gates were installed in major cities,
horseless carriages powered by magic stones ran, and it was even
possible to view distant images.  
To maintain this prosperous lifestyle, the people accepted the forceful
policies of the Order.  
Such as the invasion and enslavement of demi-human territories. Magic
stones were indispensable to support their rich lives, and securing them
meant they had no choice but to increase mining sites.  
The people worshipped and fanatically believed in the Magic Kingdom and
the Order that existed behind it.  
  
"Pontiff Dullahan, so you were here."  
  
Dullahan was on the top floor of the tower that stood in the center of
the capital. It was by chance that Luke had come here.  
Since Dullahan, as the representative of the Order, was scheduled to
declare the start of the sigil's activation at today's Founding
Festival, Luke, the commander of the Magic Knights, had merely come to
greet him as his guide.  
  
"Luke. Isn't this a magnificent view! The Magic Kingdom belongs to us,
the Order. And I shall become a god."  
  
Magic consists of five elements: Light, Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth.  
However, 50 years ago, a certain user accidentally discovered the "Dark"
attribute.  
Unlike other elemental attributes, the Dark attribute allowed magicules
to be inherited. The factors for inheritance were genetics and the
"transfer of magicules."  
However, since the transfer of magicules was an act of sharing the very
source of one's power, it carried the risk of death for the giver. In
fact, the "first user of Darkness" lost their life transferring dark
magicules to Dullahan.  
  
Until he obtained the dark magicules, Dullahan was merely a merchant.
After he "stole" the dark magicules, he changed.  
Manipulating people and repeating assassinations, he gained power with
each act, until he held authority so great that even the Magic Kingdom
could not interfere.  
He then married into the Magic Kingdom's royal family and fathered
several children. The current king is Dullahan's eldest son.  
  
"I will convert the magicules filling this world into darkness and have
it transferred to me. The ritual formula is complete. Luke, you shall
witness the birth of a god. What an honor!"  
  
It was only then that Luke realized Dullahan's scheme. It was under
Dullahan's orders that Luke had inscribed the giant sigil covering the
capital of the Magic Kingdom.  
Luke had believed the sigil was for realizing a city free from plagues
and had worked tirelessly for these past few years.  
However, Luke had doubted one point. Why was the center of this sigil
located at the tower? Wasn't this sigil meant to gather power at the
tower's center?  
But more than that doubt, Luke felt joy at being able to realize an
ideal world. Above all, for his frail fiancée!  
  
(And yet!)  
  
This sigil must be exactly what Dullahan said it was.  
  
(It’s a sigil to gather dark power using the capital's citizens as a
medium!)  
  
"Dullahan! Have you gone mad?!"  
  
Luke drew the magic sword in his hand and lunged at Dullahan, but dark
magic pinned him in place.  
  
(Gravity manipulation!)  
  
Gravity manipulation is an advanced magic that users of Darkness could
control.  
  
"Watch from there. When I pour magicules into this magic stone, the
ritual formula will activate. The birth of a god."  
  
Dullahan poured magicules into the magic stone. At that moment, the
sigil Luke and the Magic Knights had inscribed activated. The
five-element magicules of the people in the capital began converting
into dark magicules. And then...  
  
(The dark magicules are being transferred! At this rate, Mirei's life
won't last!)  
  
Luke could feel the life of his fiancée, Mirei, being drained by this
sigil.  
  
(I won't let that happen!)  
  
Though bound by strong gravity, Luke gathered his magicules. The arrow
of light Luke formed held tremendous power. But the arrow of light Luke
fired did not reach Dullahan.  
  
"Fool. There's no way your pathetic magic could reach me through this
torrent of power."  
  
Right now, the magicules—the very lives—of the people from across the
capital poured into Dullahan like a torrent within the tower.  
But then, a miracle occurred. The arrow of light Luke fired shifted the
magic stone's position ever so slightly. This minutely displaced the
sigil's focal point, moving it onto Luke, who was trapped in the gravity
field.  
  
(Ahhh—Life is flowing into me! Stop it!!)  
  
Luke wanted to flee this place, but he couldn't move due to the gravity
manipulation. The torrent of life converged on Luke.  
  
(Ahhhh—)  
  
The immense power overwhelmed Luke's consciousness.  
  
—  
  
When Luke regained consciousness, the sigil had finished its role. The
magicules of every single living being that had existed in the capital
had been converted into dark power and transferred to Luke. Fifty
thousand souls.  
Among them was Luke's fiancée, Mirei.  
  
"GAAAAHHH!"  
  
Luke roared.  
  
(Why? What's the point of gaining this power?)  
  
Dullahan was dead. Luke kicked his corpse away.  
  
(What have you done?!)  
  
He kicked it, kicked it, kicked it. Finally, he used dark magic to
corrode it until it disintegrated.  
  
Afterward, Luke ran through the capital. Searching for Mirei. Searching
for anything alive.  
But his wish was in vain. Mirei was dead. Everyone in the capital had
perished, passing their power onto Luke. Luke sobbed, clutching Mirei's
lifeless body.  
  
(Great power breeds great tragedy. Such power must not be created. The
power that births tragedy must be destroyed. Even if I have to use this
dark power to do it!)
