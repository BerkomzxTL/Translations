# Chapter 14: Arcadia B-Rank Knight

Just before noon the next day, a young knight from the Royal Guard
Knight Order came to visit.  
  
"I am Arcadia, a B-Rank knight belonging to the Royal Guard Knight
Order. What's wrong? You two look..."  
  
The pair hadn't fallen asleep until after dawn. Arcadia had arrived just
as they were waking up, rubbing their sleepy eyes.  
  
"Oh, it's nothing. But you're early."  
"Wasn't there a notification from Commander Tsukumi?"  
"Miss Hisui, this guy is really serious."  
  
Aoi whispered quietly into Hisui's ear.  
  
Arcadia is a young and capable knight, but he had an inflexibly serious
personality.  
Hisui faced Arcadia with a wry smile.  
  
"Six days from now, we will head to the Great Forest, and from there, we
will use the Elven Gate to go to the Demon Continent. We'd like to
request your assistance with creating the travel itinerary, preparing
the necessary supplies and travel funds, laying the groundwork with the
various lords, and preparing letters of introduction."  
"Ooh, Miss Hisui sounds just like a secretary."  
  
Hisui ignored Aoi's teasing and continued.  
  
"We would also like you to prepare our travel gear, including our
weapons."  
"Understood. Is there anything from you, Lady Aoi?"  
"Yeah, I need you to prepare an ID card for me. I've realized my current
pass is only recognized by certain people. Please make my rank
D-Rank."  
  
Ranks generally range from E to SS. E-Rank is a knight apprentice,
B-Rank is equivalent to a squad leader in the knight order, and S-Rank
is the commander class for territory knight orders maintained by various
lords.  
  
"You, you're D-Rank? And you lost your ID card? That warrants severe
punishment! This happens precisely because you lack self-management!"  
  
"Ahem. Arcadia, B-Rank Knight. Miss Aoi is not actually a D-Rank knight.
Please understand this is for camouflage, as we do not wish to stand out
during this mission."  
  
Hisui winked at Aoi.  
  
"Also, regarding all these travel preparations, this is not a request
from us. It is an order, so please do not misunderstand."  
"Sir! Lady Hisui, please forgive my impudence. I understand
completely."  
  
Hisui whispered into Aoi's ear.  
  
"This approach works well on serious knights."  
"By the way, Lady Aoi, do you not require an ID card with your actual
rank?"  
  
Arcadia brought it up again.  
  
(Well, her real rank is probably C-Rank, or maybe B-Rank like me.)  
  
Arcadia wanted to be a little mean to Aoi to let out some pent up
anger.  
  
"True. Miss Aoi, what is your actual rank?"  
"Me? I'm SSS (Triple S)."  
  
(Huh! What is she saying?)  
  
Arcadia gave her a skeptical look, but he was astonished when Aoi took
out her pass.  
  
"This pass is the proof."  
  
(The Cherry Blossom Crest of the Six Heroes! Isn't that the Highest
Priority Pass! Th-then, she really is SSS!)  
  
Arcadia jumped back once before prostrating himself on the ground.  
  
"P-p-p-please forgive my immense disrespect!!!"  
"See? People who recognize this pass react like this... And I also found
out it's inconvenient because, actually, many people don't know it."  
"Miss Aoi, you're SSS!"  
  
Hisui wasn't particularly surprised to hear Aoi was SSS. She partly felt
it was only natural for Aoi, and for some reason, she felt proud.  
  
"So this pass was something amazing too."  
"I was thinking this the day before yesterday too, but why doesnâ€™t Hisui
recognize it? I thought any knight would know this as common sense."  
"Hmm, I'm just a country bumpkin, after all."  
  
While patting the pouting Hisui's head, Aoi turned her gaze to the
prostrating Arcadia.  
  
"Arcadia. It's awkward, so I'd really appreciate it if you stopped
that."
