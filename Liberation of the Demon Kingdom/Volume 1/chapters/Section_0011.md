# Chapter 11 Anxiety and Destiny.

"Jaspa, how's the sword?"  
  
Aoi and Hisui had come to Jaspa's shop to pick up Nijimaru.  
  
"Miss Aoi, Master really is amazing. Thank you for entrusting this to
me."  
  
Aoi took the Nijimaru that Jaspa brought and slowly drew it from its
sheath. Its blade shone with rainbow-colored light. Nijimaru was a magic
sword forged by Jinrai, upon which the Six Heroes had each engraved
their own magicules. A rare magic sword engraved with the magicules of
Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, and Light. Its power was immense, but handling
it required precise magicule control.  
  
"Yeah, thank you! It's even better than I expected!"  
"I'm glad to hear that from you, Miss Aoi. Oh? What's that Hisui is
holding?"  
"Ah, it's Jinrai's sword."  
"I remember it, Miss Aoi."  
  
Hisui drew the sword from its sheath and showed the blade to Jaspa.  
  
"It hasn't changed one bit from the Yagiri I saw back then. Is Hisui
going to use this? You really are Miss Aoi's partner."  
"Hisui, actually, I used to use this Yagiri."  
  
Hisui looked anew at the Yagiri she held in her hands.  
  
"Yes, I will learn to wield it properly."  
  
Hisui's eyes were teary.  
  
—  
  
That evening, they ate at The Whimsy. As usual, the two were satisfied
with the delicious meal. While sipping a little wine, Hisui voiced her
anxieties.  
  
"Miss Aoi, what has happened to me?  
I participated in the battle on the Sugal Plains as a messenger soldier.
At that time, darkness covered the plains, sound disappeared, and I was
terrified.  
I couldn't think straight, all I could do was sit down and hold my head.
And when the darkness suddenly lifted, I found myself surrounded by the
demon army.  
I was desperate. I desperately channeled my magicules and swung my
sword. But I ran out of strength.  
Just when I thought I would be killed, \*that\* happened."  
  
Hisui gazed at Aoi's face.  
  
"A chaotic dance of particles of darkness and light. It was beautiful. A
dance of power completely beyond my reach, no matter what I did. From
that moment on, I began to want to become stronger.  
But, those particles of darkness from that time are inside me? A Shrine
Maiden? I don't possess such extraordinary power.  
Honestly, I can't believe it. What is going to happen to me?"  
  
Aoi peered into Hisui's eyes. Hisui averted her gaze, dazzled by Aoi's
stare which seemed capable of seeing through anything.  
  
"I understand very well how hard you've worked, Hisui. I don't know any
knight your age who can control magicules so well and has such flawless
swordsmanship."  
"But, I'm much weaker than you, Miss Aoi, and that dark swordsman..."  
"No, Hisui is strong. Both as a knight and as a person. And you'll
become even stronger on this next journey.  
I'm truly grateful that you're my partner, Hisui.  
Besides, I genuinely want to be of help to you too. Though, since I have
a tendency to rush headlong into things, I might end up causing you
trouble instead."  
"Miss Aoi, thank you. Now that I feel relieved, the wine seems to be
hitting me."  
  
Aoi smiled at Hisui, who laughed as if to cover up having shown
weakness.  
  
"Well then, shall we head home? I want Hisui to know about me too, but
it's too intense a topic to discuss here."  
  
When the two returned home, Hisui's belongings had arrived at the
warehouse. Although, there wasn't much. Just a few books, a change of
clothes, and some small items like tableware.  
  
"You really like Jinrai, don't you."  
  
Aoi said, slightly exasperated that all the books were about Jinrai.  
  
"Yes, I love him."  
"... It's late today, so let's leave the unpacking for tomorrow. Let's
take a bath and rest."  
  
—  
  
It was after they had taken turns bathing, changed into their sleepwear,
and finished preparing for bed.  
  
"Hisui, could I talk to you for a bit?"  
"Yes, please."  
  
Aoi placed two cups of hot milk with honey, one for Hisui and one for
herself, on the table in front of the sofa.  
  
"It's not exactly a pleasant story, though."  
  
As the two sat down on the sofa, Aoi began to speak, haltingly.  
  
"This is the story of the Demon God of Chaos and me. I want Hisui to
know."
