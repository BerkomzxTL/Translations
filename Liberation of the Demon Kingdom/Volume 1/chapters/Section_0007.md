# Chapter 7: Aoi's Magic Sword

"This one and this one. I'll buy one for me and one for Hisui. Bill the
Royal Guard."  
  
Aoi was choosing matching Mithril breastplates for herself and Hisui.  
  
"As expected of Miss Aoi. You choose good items. This is Mithril I
forged myself, engraved with light magic. It won't break even under an
Arrow Bear's strike! Plus, it's light."  
"Indeed. It's good quality."  
"What about a magic sword?"  
"I have this one, you see."  
"Ah. The Master's masterpiece..."  
"Miss Aoi’s sword was made by Lord Jinrai?!"  
  
Aoi quietly drew the katana from its sheath.  
  
"The magic katana, Nijimaru Raikou. Jinrai's masterpiece. And it holds
many feelings within it."  
  
The blade was slightly curved, and glowed faintly, sometimes with
iridescence depending on how you looked at it. (TN: Nijimaru translates
to Rainbow)  
  
"It's a beautiful blade. I can feel a very warm power coming from it...
But I probably couldn't use it. It's too complex."  
  
Looking directly at the blade, Hisui understood. It wasn't a
non-elemental magic sword; rather, many kinds of magic were intricately
intertwined within it. It didn't seem like a blade forged by human
hands. Aoi quietly returned the katana to its sheath.  
  
"Jaspa! I'm leaving it with you until tomorrow, so please do the
maintenance."  
"Yes. Leave it to me. This is a job only I can do."  
  
Jaspa took Nijimaru from Aoi and nostalgically stroked its sheath. Then,
after carefully carrying it to the back of the shop, he returned holding
several magic swords.  
  
"By the way, Miss Hisui, do you want a magic sword? They aren't on the
Master's level, but I have some pieces I'm confident in. I even have a
sword here with the same engraving as the *'Yagiri'* that Miss Aoi used
long ago."  
"Eh? Yagiri? The one Lord Jinrai is said to have risked his life
forging...?"  
  
Aoi's eyes darted around as she fell silent.  
  
"Ah, the Master's skill back then was terrifyingly sharp. He might have
gotten a bit full of himself. One day, he challenged Aoi, who had just
dropped by unexpectedly..."  
"I was childish too. Jinrai said things like *'I can cut down any magic
with my magic sword,'* so I broke several of the magic swords he made
with my arrows of light."  
  
Aoi narrowed her eyes slightly, looking nostalgic.  
  
"After that, the Master dedicated himself to forging magic swords,
putting his life on the line. And thus, Yagiri was completed..."  
"Yagiri is the magic katana Jinrai forged, staking his life on it. That
blade sliced my full-power arrow of light clean in two. I used Yagiri
right up until Jinrai forged Nijimaru."  
"Miss Aoi. What happened to Yagiri?"  
"Ah, I left it with Berg."  
"I see. Anyway, Miss Hisui, how about a magic sword? This is the one
with the same engraving as Yagiri."  
  
Hisui's eyes sparkled as she stared at the magic sword Jaspa was
holding.  
  
"Hm? It's rare for you, Jaspa, to offer a magic sword without assessing
the buyer's skill."  
"She's your partner, Miss Aoi, isn't she? Why would I need to doubt her
skill?"  
"Thanks, Jaspa. But Hisui doesn't need a magic sword from here."  
  
At the unexpected reply, Hisui and Jaspa looked at each other, both
wearing sad expressions.  
  
—  
  
Hisui, who loves magic swords dearly, wanted one. When Aoi said she'd
give her something even better, she felt like she was over the moon, but
the place she was taken to was a clothing store.  
Aoi picked out three sets of clothes for her that looked very functional
yet elegant, and they bought them.  
  
"You should wear one of these tomorrow. And let's have you wear the
magic armor I bought at Jaspa's shop. Hm? You seem a bit down..."  
"I'm sorry. I know you got me wonderful things, both the magic armor and
the clothes, but... the magic sword..."  
"Yes, I understand very well that Hisui loves magic swords. But you
know, there's equipment that's more suitable for you."  
"Eh? What do you mean by that?"  
"That's still a secret! Come on, it's evening now, let's head back!
Tonight, we're having drinks at The Whimsy!"
