# Chapter 5: King Berg

At that moment, Fuselnia was just then on her way to the castle.  
  
(Is that girl Hisui? Is she alright now?)  
  
The girl causing trouble in front of the main gate was Hisui, the one
she had brought back from the Mars territory the other day.  
  
"Hisui?"  
  
This marks the beginning of Fuselnia's nightmare day.  
  
"Vice Commander Fuselnia!"  
"Are you feeling better now?"  
"Yes, as you can see, thanks to you. I’m very grateful for that time. I
think I would have died if the Vice Commander had arrived just a little
later."  
"No, I should be the one thanking you. You prevented the squad from
being annihilated. Thank you."  
  
Fuselnia was relieved to see Hisui looking well.  
  
"By the way, it looked like you were having some trouble."  
"Vice Commander Fuselnia. Actually, this young lady here was trying to
pass through the gate with some kind of strange pass."  
"Let me see it."  
  
Fuselnia took the pass from Aoi and was astonished by the insignia
written on it.  
  
(Isn't this the Cherry Blossom Crest of the Six Heroes? This pass grants
the highest level of privileges. Who is this girl? Since she's with
Hisui, could she be from Intelligence?)  
"I cannot make a judgment on this."  
  
Fuselnia told Aoi this and then instructed the gate guard.  
  
"Contact Commander Tsukumi."  
  
—  
  
When the message arrived, Tsukumi was in the King's office discussing
the response to the events in the Mars territory with King Berg and
Prime Minister Sagittarius. When the door was knocked hastily and a gate
guard appeared, Tsukumi made a sour face.  
  
"We're in an important meeting."  
  
The gate guard, astonished to find not only the Commander but also the
King and the Prime Minister present, reported to the Commander that he
had been ordered by the Vice Commander to deliver the message
urgently.  
  
"A girl possessing a Cherry Blossom Crest pass is waiting at the main
gate."  
  
Upon hearing that report, the first one to react was Berg.  
  
"What? Bring her here at once!"  
  
The gate guard, startled by the King's intensity, hurried back to the
main gate.  
  
—  
  
Fuselnia was perplexed.  
  
"*'Bring her to the King's office,'* he said? Just who is this girl?"  
  
This overly unguarded girl didn't seem like a particularly important
figure. Hisui was equally bewildered.  
  
(His Majesty King Berg's office! Why? How?)  
  
Moreover, they said Commander Tsukumi and Prime Minister Sagittarius
were also present.  
  
(Miss Aoi, please give me a break!)  
  
—  
  
When Aoi reached the office, she opened the door without even knocking.
She later told Hisui, "Berg can sense my presence from 20 meters away,"
but...  
Fuselnia was stunned.  
  
(How rude!)  
  
But that thought became a thing of the past with the next sight.  
  
"Berg!"  
  
The girl who had called His Majesty Berg by name just like that threw
her arms around him. The knight rank is permitted to wear swords even in
the King's presence. This time was no exception. Fuselnia knew the girl
was armed but couldn't stop her.  
  
(There's no presence in her movements!)  
  
However, Fuselnia was even more astonished afterwards! His Majesty the
King, who has always been so dignified, returned the hug with a huge
smile.  
  
"Has it been three years? Are you feeling better now?"  
"Yeah, I still can't use my right hand, but I won't lose to you,
Berg."  
"I see. That's good."  
"Mr. Saji, Tsukumi, long time no see!"  
  
Fuselnia and Hisui felt like they might faint at this sight.  
  
(Hugging the King is disrespectful. And calling the Prime Minister *'Mr.
Saji'*! How overly familiar she is with the Commander too!)  
  
"Lady Aoi, it is truly good to have you back."  
  
Seeing Prime Minister Sagittarius looking deeply moved and Tsukumi
shedding tears, Fuselnia and Hisui were dumbfounded.  
  
—  
  
"I see. So that girl is Hisui."  
  
After the emotional(?) reunion, Aoi was talking to Tsukumi about Hisui's
treatment. It seemed to be a complicated discussion, as Hisui and
Fuselnia were kicked out of the office, leaving only Aoi behind. Before
leaving the office, they overheard snippets of conversation like,  
"Hisui,... my..., dark magicules... That's why the magic sword..."  
but couldn't piece it together.  
  
"Hisui, who is that girl?"  
"She's Squad Leader Aoi from Intelligence."  
"How can that be! Would His Majesty meet a mere squad leader who just
showed up unannounced? And she has the Cherry Blossom Crest pass."  
"I only just met her yesterday myself. Is that pass really something
amazing? For all that, she couldn't get through the main gate,
though?"  
"Hisui, do you really not know about that pass?"  
  
Fuselnia said, looking exasperated.  
  
(Still... Who is Miss Aoi, really?)  
  
It was true that Aoi's house had a lot of expensive furniture. Not what
you'd expect from a mere knight.  
  
"She must be a user, right? What does she specialize in?"  
"Yesterday, she healed me. I think she's a light user."  
"She doesn't look strong, though."  
"I thought so too. But I can't picture myself winning against Miss
Aoi."  
  
Hisui had a knack for gauging an opponent's strength.  
  
(I can't figure Miss Aoi out. Even that magic sword at her hip probably
couldn't be wielded by someone with ordinary skill.)  
  
Ordinary magic swords have the effect of amplifying specific magicules.
Therefore, a magic sword of the same attribute as oneself has better
compatibility. The exceptions are light and dark magic swords. These two
attributes are less affected by other attributes.  
  
(That magic sword didn't have a fixed magic attribute. No, maybe it's
better to say it holds multiple powers? I think it has the effect of
purely converting one's own magicules into attack power... If it were
me, I'd choose a magic sword that could be elementally enchanted and
'support' my own power. That sword has high attack power, but I don't
think it can be controlled well... Is it a sword meant for brute force
cutting by pouring vast amounts of magicules into it?)  
"Miss Aoi's magicule capacity might be high."  
"Why do you think so?"  
  
Just as Hisui was about to answer that question, the office door
suddenly opened, and Aoi burst out energetically.  
  
"Hisui, come here for a second."  
  
Aoi took Hisui's hand and pulled her into the office.  
  
"This is Hisui. As of yesterday, she's my partner. Everyone, please
treat her well."  
  
Aoi placed a hand on Hisui's head and made her bow. Hisui bowed,
speechless and wide-eyed. Seeing Hisui like this, Berg spoke.  
  
"Hisui, tomorrow, I'll need some time before your talk with Tsukumi. If
Aoi recognizes you as her partner, then we must prepare suitable
treatment for you."  
"Who exactly is Miss Aoi?"  
  
Hisui couldn't hold back her question any longer.  
  
"B-Berg's illegitimate child."  
  
Aoi answered awkwardly.  
Berg looked like he wanted to say something, but after thinking for a
moment, he said with a wry smile,  
"Well, I suppose that will do."  
  
"Fuselnia! Not a word of this to anyone!"  
  
Fuselnia felt her stomach ache at Berg's words.  
  
(I didn't want to hear this kind of talk either.)  
  
Afterwards, Fuselnia was also strongly warned by Tsukumi,  
"Forget what happened today."  
  
"If word of this gets out, you'll lose your head," she added.  
  
Fuselnia regretted having called out to Hisui at the main gate.
