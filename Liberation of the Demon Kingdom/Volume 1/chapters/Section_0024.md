# Chapter 24: Merchant Caravan

When Aoi and Hisui went to the cafeteria, Gam and Jim were getting
lectured by the captain.  
  
"I can't allow such unknown people to accompany us. Why would you two
offer to let people whose backgrounds are a mystery join us?"  
"W-Well, that’s..."  
"Captain, I'm sorry. We apologize for the sudden request."  
  
Aoi suddenly spoke to him, and the caravan leader, Onjin, was inwardly
flustered.  
  
(These girls, I’m blown away by their beauty… Both of them are
beautiful.)  
  
However, Onjin was a merchant who had overcome many difficult
situations. He was well aware of the common practice of hiring beautiful
women to trap business rivals. He had no intention of making a bad
decision in front of beautiful women.  
  
"No, I should be the one apologizing for the late introduction. I am
Onjin, who manages this caravan. I belong to the Merchant Guild of the
Royal Capital."  
  
Onjin took out a pass from his pocket and showed it to Aoi.  
  
"Thank you for your courtesy. I am Aoi, a D-Rank knight of the Asura
Kingdom Intelligence Division. And this is..."  
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Onjin. I am Hisui, an A-Rank knight of the Asura
Kingdom Intelligence Division."  
  
Aoi and Hisui showed Onjin their passes, which served as
identification.  
  
(The Intelligence Division? And an A-Rank knight!)  
  
Onjin carefully examined the passes.  
  
(They're definitely genuine! But what does this mean?)  
  
Aoi spoke to the perplexed Onjin.  
  
"We’re going to Barlmin territory capital under the orders of the Asura
royal family for a certain purpose. However, due to the nature of the
orders, we don't want to attract too much attention. We couldn't pass
through the Royal Capital's checkpoint in a group for certain reasons,
so we were looking for a caravan in this village to accompany us as a
cover along the way."  
"Indeed, the two of you are quite conspicuous."  
  
(Why would the royal family give such a secret mission to such beautiful
women...? It's bound to attract attention...)  
  
Inwardly, he was appalled by the royal family's choice of personnel, but
he knew that the two of them would be excellent escorts for the
journey.  
  
(If knights of that rank were to accompany us, government officials
wouldn't be able to make frivolous complaints. However...)  
  
"You two are traveling to the Barlmin territory capital for a mission,
but isn't it a dangerous one?"  
"No, no, actually, it's about laying the groundwork for a certain
noble's incognito trip. Well, there are more or less forces who are
skeptical about leaving the Royal Capital for an incognito trip..."  
"I understand the situation. Understood. If you're willing to serve as
escorts along the way, we have no objections."  
"Thank you, Mr. Onjin. We'll just be accompanying you, so when monetary
expenses such as accommodation and meals occur, we'll separate our
actions. However, if the caravan finds itself in a difficult situation,
we will provide assistance."  
"That is a welcome offer, but..."  
"Also, about those two over there."  
  
Aoi looked at Gam and Jim.  
  
"I was thinking of teaching those two magic, would that be alright?"  
"I don't mind at all, but... Is that alright with you?"  
"Yes, Hisui likes to bully weak, oh, excuse me. Promising young
people."  
  
Aoi whispered to Onjin.  
  
"Aoi, I can hear you. Ahem, Mr. Onjin, I see those two as diamonds in
the rough that will shine if polished. We would definitely like to guide
them."  
"Ah, I understand. If you could provide guidance along the way, I could
show my face to their fathers. Thank you in advance. Hey, you two, is
that alright with you!"  
  
From the beginning, Gam and Jim had no right to refuse, and the two,
feeling the murderous intent in Hisui's gaze, could only nod.
