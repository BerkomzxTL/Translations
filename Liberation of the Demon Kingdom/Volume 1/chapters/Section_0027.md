# Chapter 27: Aoi's Stone Statue

When Aoi and Hisui went to the dining hall, they found a scene from hell
unfolding. Members of the merchant caravan were scattered around like
corpses.  
  
"Oh my, how sloppy."  
"It's not *'how sloppy.'* It's a mess, so please do something about
it."  
  
Aoi was told by the innkeeper and gave a wry smile. Aoi was the one who
caused this. She gave healing to the men slumped on the floor and
tables.  
  
"Miss Aoi, amazing. I feel fine already."  
  
Aoi, receiving gazes from the men that were a mixture of praise and
adoration, walked over to Gam, who was tightly bound. And she was
impressed by the splendor of the magic.  
  
(Amazing. She mastered it so quickly.)  
  
Just as Aoi was about to attempt to dispel the magic to release Gam, she
met Hisui's eyes.  
  
"Hisui, amazing. You can already do it."  
"Are you going to dispel it?"  
"It's pitiful to leave him like this."  
"Not pitiful at all. We should leave him like this a little longer as a
warning of what happens when you lay a hand on Aoi."  
  
Hisui said this and glanced around the dining hall. Her gaze was filled
with murderous intent, making the men who were trying to flirt with Aoi
on the way tremble.  
  
"Good morning."  
  
Just then, Jim came into the dining hall carrying a stone statue of
Aoi.  
  
"Jim! W-What are you holding?"  
"Ah, Miss Hisui made this yesterday by kneading magicules! It's amazing,
isn't it, Miss Hisui? I really admire you!"  
"Let me see!"  
  
(This is amazing! To be able to control magicules this skillfully. Hisui
is a genius!)  
  
Aoi stared at the statue intently.  
  
"Um, Aoi. The reason I used Aoi as a motif is because Aoi was nearby and
I used her as a reference, or rather, it's not because I'm interested in
Aoi and made her my model, but because Aoi is beautiful and inspired my
creative impulse, and there's absolutely no strange feelings involved,
um, you see..."  
  
Aoi grabbed Hisui's shoulders with both hands as she began to make
strange excuses,  
  
"Amazing! Hisui. To be able to do something like this!! You're a genius.
Ah, I wish I could show this to Jinrai!"  
  
She shook her back and forth, excitedly rattling on.  
  
"No, anyone can do it if they know how..."  
"What are you saying, Hisui! There aren't many people who can do
something like this."  
"That's right. Miss Hisui. Ah, how wonderful. To be able to do something
like this with earth magic!"  
  
Aoi and Jim were moved, standing before the bewildered Hisui.  
  
"Hisui is definitely the only partner for me!"  
"Miss Hisui is going to teach me about magical tools, right! Ah, it's
like a dream..."  
"Um, is it really that amazing?"  
“"Amazing!!"”  
  
Aoi and Jim's voices overlapped perfectly.  
  
"Um, well…I'm really sorry to interrupt when you're all excited, but
could you please release Gam? I feel sorry for him if he stays like
that..."  
"Ah, I forgot... Hisui, let's release him already."  
  
Persuaded by Onjin's request and Aoi's words, Hisui reluctantly released
Gam.
