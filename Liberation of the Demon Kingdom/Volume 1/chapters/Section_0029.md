# Chapter 29: Hisui's Thoughts

**Last chapter of volume 1, The Capital**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
That day was a night in the wild. It was three days away from the
Barlmin territory. Aoi and Hisui were giving water and young vegetables
to the Gamou birds.  
  
"Thank you, you guys."  
  
Hisui spoke gently to the Gamou birds.  
  
"Hisui, let's have dinner too. Mr. Onjin, would you like to join us?"  
"...."  
  
Aoi and the members of the caravan hit it off very well. However,
despite most of the members being young, no one tried to flirt with Aoi.
Because whenever someone tried to approach Aoi, a piercing murderous
intent would come flying from somewhere. No one tried to flirt with
Hisui either. Everyone was afraid of the girl who emitted such sharp
murderous intent.  
  
"Everyone is looking at Aoi with lewd eyes."  
"That's not true. They're all very nice people. Hisui, let's drink today
too."  
"I'm fine... ."  
  
Drinking parties began when night came. Today, a drinking contest
started with Aoi at the center with a few people. Hisui sighed deeply
and kneaded magicules into the stone she was holding, shaping it into
Aoi's form. Hisui had gotten the hang of it, and could now create a
statue of Aoi in just a few moments.  
  
"That's wonderful."  
"Thank you."  
"It seems Jim is also getting good inspiration from it, so I'm
grateful."  
"No, I'm learning a lot too."  
  
Onjin sat down next to Hisui and watched Aoi and the others drinking
happily.  
  
"Miss Aoi seems to know how to relax."  
"Yes, Aoi always seems to be having fun."  
"Miss Hisui, you seem to be brooding about something."  
"I just want to be of help to Aoi."  
  
Hisui muttered quietly.  
  
"I think Miss Aoi feels the same way. There's no need for Miss Hisui to
dwell on it so much. I think Miss Hisui is supporting Miss Aoi enough.
If you're too tense, you won't be able to move when the time comes.
Enjoy when you can enjoy, and do what you have to do properly. Isn't
that good enough?"  
"I've had a lot of things happen to me in the past few days, and each
time Aoi showed me the way... I feel that I need to do my best to follow
Aoi's lead..."  
  
Hisui faced Onjin.  
  
"I thought I had to keep Aoi connected to me. I may have been trying too
hard. Mr. Onjin, thank you. I think I'll try to walk alongside Aoi
instead of chasing after her."  
"Yes, that's a good idea."  
"But, Mr. Onjin. I'm going to beat up anyone who tries to flirt with
Aoi."  
"Everyone is young, so please be gentle."  
  
Hisui bowed slightly to Onjin and walked towards Aoi.  
  
"Aoi, I'll have a drink too!"  
"Ohhh, Hisui! I've been waiting for you!"  
  
Onjin watched the scene and quietly finished his cup.
