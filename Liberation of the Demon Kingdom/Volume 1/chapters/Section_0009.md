# Chapter 9 Aoi

Dr. Amano was also present there.  
  
"Why is Dr. Amano here too?"  
"Because I am Miss Aoi's superior."  
  
After glancing at Amano's composed face, Aoi turned her gaze to
Tsukumi.  
  
"Tsukumi, please give my thanks to Berg. This will make it easier for us
to act."  
"Yes, His Majesty thinks so too. Now, regarding this matter."  
"The Six Heroes were supposed to have defeated the Demon God of Chaos on
the Demon Continent and lifted the curse placed upon it. However, in
reality, the curse of the Sugal Plains continued to firmly corrode the
Demon Continent. But, three years ago, during the clash between the
Demon Army and the Asura Allied Forces, the curse was lifted by a single
warrior. Or perhaps it would be better to say it was sealed."  
"Yes, I was on that battlefield as a private."  
"That curse was merely sealed, and there's a possibility it could be
revived. Specifically, by using the magicules of a powerful dark magic
user as a medium."  
"But are there really people plotting such a thing?"  
"The Order of Chaos. Their purpose is..."  
"Their purpose is to prevent *'order'* from being brought to the world.
It's like a religion. They believe a world that gains order becomes
filled with power and will perish by that very power."  
  
Aoi, with an expression full of bitterness, forced out the words.  
  
"But, are there really powerful dark magic users? I've never heard of
any dark magic users."  
"Dark magic users do exist. In fact, I know three. However, *'Shrine
Maidens'* ... that's what the Order of Chaos calls a dark magic user
powerful enough to revive the curse."  
  
Aoi continued speaking.  
  
"Hisui has the potential to become a Shrine Maiden."  
  
Hisui recalled the words of the swordsman who called himself Buenos.  
  
"*’I sense darkness. Are you worthy of being a shrine maiden?’*"  
  
She hadn't paid it any mind at the time, but...  
  
"What do you mean?"  
"Hisui probably absorbed the magicules released by the dark magic user,
the warrior who sealed the curse, on the Sugal Plains. No, she
assimilated with them."  
  
(Ah, so the warrior I saw on the Sugal Plains was a dark magic user.)  
  
Hisui recalled the scene from the Sugal Plains.  
  
"But, something like that... is it possible?"  
"I don't know the cause. But it's a fact. Hisui absorbed dark magicules
on the Sugal Plains back then. That's why you could stand against that
cursed sword in the recent battle. The most effective way to counter the
power of darkness is to strike it with the powers of "darkness" and
"light" at the same time. The fact that Hisui could counter that cursed
sword is proof that she has dark power within her."  
  
Aoi slowly placed her right hand on Hisui's shoulder.  
  
"Whether Hisui is the Shrine Maiden or not? I don't know. But we need to
oppose the Order of Chaos. Also..."  
  
Aoi chose her words carefully as she spoke.  
  
"The Shrine Maiden could also become the key to liberating the Demon
Continent."  
  
—  
  
"I want the two of you to cross over to the Demon Continent and deliver
a personal letter from King Berg to Queen Dustis."  
  
Tsukumi continued.  
  
"The content concerns the liberation of the Demon Continent. Departure
is in one week. The Royal Guard Knights will provide full cooperation
for the preparations."  
"Communication with you during your journey will be handled by the
Intelligence Division. While the Royal Guard Knights will handle
groundwork with the lords, requests for cooperation from private
merchant guilds and mercenary groups will be made by the Intelligence
Division."  
"Since *'Yagiri Raikou'* was given to Hisui so ostentatiously and she
was appointed to A-Rank, the lords will have no choice but to cooperate.
This approach also allows us to probe the lords' intentions..."  
"Yes, among the lords, there are factions uneasy about the Demon Kingdom
gaining power. The Intelligence Division wants to know the lords' true
intentions."  
  
(So that's what this is about...)  
  
Hisui trembled at the fact that major events were unfolding centered
around her.  
  
"Besides. The Order of Chaos will likely target Hisui, and if it becomes
known that she might be the key to liberating the Demon Continent,
people who wish to harm her might appear."  
  
Hisui nodded firmly at Tsukumi's words.  
  
"But can I fulfill this mission with my power...?"  
"Hisui's magicule capacity is large. If you learn how to wield dark
magicules, you'll become even stronger. Besides, the magic sword Hisui
received, Yagiri Raikou, is like the other half of my Nijimaru. It was
made by Jinrai and has light magic engraved into it. I believe it will
lend you strength."  
  
Hisui looked at the Yagiri she had been gripping tightly.  
  
"A sword by Lord Jinrai..."  
"And also..."  
  
Aoi took a deep breath and spun her words.  
  
"We will go to the Great Forest to retrieve the *'Dragon Armament'*.
We'll cross to the Demon Continent using the *'Elven Gate'* from the
Great Forest. I want Hisui to learn to master the Dragon Armament,
Jinrai's masterpiece. It's something only Hisui, a user of Earth and
Darkness, can do."  
  
Hisui had only heard rumors. Its fists could split the earth, its roar
could part the seas, and its armor could repel any attack...  
  
"I will do my best to meet everyone's expectations. But, please tell me
just one thing. Who are you, Miss Aoi? And no saying you're King Berg's
illegitimate child!"  
  
Hisui asked while looking straight into Aoi's eyes. Tsukumi tried to
stop Aoi from answering, but Aoi interrupted her and replied.  
  
"I... am the daughter of the Demon God of Chaos..."

Aoi's true identity has been revealed. She is also a brave girl.
