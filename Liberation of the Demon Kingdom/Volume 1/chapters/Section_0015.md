# Chapter 15: Preparing for the Journey

The following days were very busy for Hisui. Laying the groundwork with
the various lords wasn't particularly troublesome, as notifications had
already been sent out by the Royal Guard Knights. Arcadia's skillful
coordination, in particular, was a great help.  
  
"As expected, serious people are really good at this sort of thing!"  
  
Hisui was impressed.  
  
However, creating the travel itinerary and preparing the necessary
supplies took time. This was because Hisui, being from the countryside,
had almost no travel experience, and Aoi, who should have been
accustomed to travel, was no help.  
  
"Traveling is just about being self-sufficient. As long as you have some
money and a change of clothes, you'll be fine!"  
  
So she said.  
  
Regarding the travel itinerary, Hisui, being from the countryside,
quickly gave up and left it entirely to Arcadia, who seemed to be good
at that sort of thing. As for procuring supplies, she dragged a
reluctant Aoi along and toured the shops in the royal capital.  
  
"Hisui, let's just get some of the things the knights are using at the
royal castle."  
"But the Knight Order's things have that distinct man smell..."  
  
Although there were women in the Royal Guard Knights, the vast majority
were men. Since new equipment went to the senior knights, most of the
items in the Knight Order's warehouse were used and had a stale smell.  
  
"Besides, I want Miss Aoi to help me pick out cute things..."  
  
Aoi found Hisui's slightly embarrassed way of speaking very endearing.  
  
"Alright! Leave it to me! Come on, let's hurry."  
  
Following after Aoi, who had suddenly become very enthusiastic, Hisui
felt a sense of fulfillment.  
  
â€”  
  
The day before departure. Aoi visited the royal castle to meet Berg.  
  
"Berg, I'm leaving tomorrow."  
"Yeah, I'm counting on you regarding Dustis."  
"No, this is my own way of taking responsibility as the daughter of the
Demon God of Chaos."  
  
Seeing Aoi answer while looking him straight in the eye, Berg
responded.  
  
"Aoi, I think Dustis feels the same way. That it's her responsibility as
the Queen of the Demon Kingdom, something like that. You and the Demon
God of Chaos are different people. You don't have to bear the burden of
the Demon God of Chaos' deeds."  
"Yeah, I know..."  
"By the way, how is Hisui?"  
"I really think she's my other half."  
  
Aoi said with a smile.  
  
"From the sound of it, you seem to be good partners."  
"Yeah. She told me she would take on half of my pain."  
  
Berg smiled warmly at Aoi's answer.  
  
"That's right, Aoi. Especially if Hisui is your other half. Rely on
Hisui."  
"Okay. Well then, I'm off. Next time we meet, I'll be sure to return
looking more cheerful."
