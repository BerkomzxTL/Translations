# Chapter 13: Encounter

For 500 years, Luke had continuously hindered the development of magic.
He eliminated groundbreaking inventors along with their records. When
strong nations emerged, he sowed the seeds of conflict to weaken them.
And now, he was in the royal capital of the Asura Kingdom, intending to
probe the country's internal affairs and sow the seeds of conflict.  
  
The Asura Kingdom was prosperous—prosperous to a degree Luke could not
tolerate. It overflowed with vast quantities of goods, and the people's
faces were bright. But Luke knew this prosperity was inextricably linked
to ruin.  
  
(It would be best to completely seal the Demon Continent and guide its
inhabitants to the Asura Kingdom. That way, war will break out.)  
  
Just then, Luke sensed strong magicules.  
  
(Could someone truly possess this many magicules?)  
  
Luke became intrigued by this strong presence. What kind of person is
it? He decided he wanted to see their face.  
  
(A girl?)  
  
There stood a girl surrounded by many guards. Several guards lay fallen
around her, and the girl was utterly terrified.  
  
"Nooo! Stay away!"  
  
With that cry, the guards who were trying to capture the girl were sent
flying.  
  
"Magicules going out of control, is it?"  
  
It wasn't particularly unusual. It's not uncommon for magicules to run
wild during growth spurts, leaking out uncontrollably.  
The outcome is self-destruction. Just as Luke, having lost interest, was
about to leave, the girl turned her face towards him.  
  
"Mirei!"  
  
Luke saw Mirei there. No, she was younger than Mirei, but it was
undoubtedly Mirei.  
Luke created a gravity field, pinning all the guards to the spot. Then
he slowly approached the girl.  
  
"Young girl, will you come with me?"  
  
The girl was frightened.  
  
"I can help you suppress your magicule rampage."  
  
The girl nodded and slowly held out her hand.  
  
"Your name?"  
"Aoi."  
  
Aoi was born an orphan and lived in a convent for 10 years. She
possessed strong magicules from birth, but with no one in the convent
able to teach magic, she became unable to control her magicules as she
grew.  
One day, Aoi's magicules went berserk, and she destroyed the convent.  
  
(At this rate, I'll hurt the nuns.)  
  
Frightened by her own power, Aoi fled the convent. Aoi hated this power,
even though she didn't want to hurt anyone.  
And on that day, the guards had spoken to her, and out of sheer terror,
her power had run wild.  
  
"From now on, I will teach you magic."  
  
For Aoi, it was a dreamlike time. Luke was everything she could wish for
in a father and a teacher. He guided Aoi, treating her kindly, sometimes
strictly. Aoi also grew fond of Luke, who rejoiced in her growth. Above
all,  
  
(I want to be able to use this power properly.)  
  
She didn't want to cause another incident like the time her power ran
wild at the convent.  
Aoi learned the essence of magic and mastered supreme swordsmanship from
Luke. Aoi was strong, perhaps due to innate talent. By the age of 13,
she had grown strong enough to be comparable to an SS-Rank knight.  
And then…  
  
—  
  
"One day, I learned that Luke had been hindering the development of
magic and sowing the seeds of conflict for 500 years to maintain the
world's balance.  
That kind hearted Luke was leading the world into chaos. I agonized over
it. I agonized and agonized and agonized.  
I cooperated with Berg and the others. To defeat the Demon God of
Chaos."  
  
Aoi squeezed the words out. Her voice trembled. Hisui gently put an arm
around Aoi's shoulders.  
  
"Miss Aoi. Please let me share half of your anguish. If you're suffering
but holding back your tears, I'll cry for you instead. If you're
troubled, I'll worry with you. So please, don't carry it all alone
anymore."  
"Hisui, thank you."  
  
Aoi gently put her hand around Hisui's back.  
  
"From now on, we’ll share fun and happy times together."  
  
—  
  
"Miss Aoi, what do you intend to do now?"  
"I want to undo the barrier Luke placed on the Demon Continent 500 years
ago. The curse on the Sugal Plains is merely dormant.  
Unless the fundamental barrier is destroyed, the Demon Continent cannot
be liberated. As the daughter of the Demon God of Chaos, I want to
liberate the Demon Continent."  
"I understand. Please let me help as well, however little I can
offer."  
"Thank you, Hisui."  
  
There was still something Aoi hadn't told Hisui.  
  
(I'll tell Hisui everything. So please wait a little longer.)
