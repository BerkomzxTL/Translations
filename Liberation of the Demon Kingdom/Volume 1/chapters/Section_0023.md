# Chapter 23: Hisui's Feelings

"Aoi, what was that just now?"  
"Ah, if the rumors are as they say, then there are bandits out there. If
those two are the escorts, the trade caravan will likely be wiped out.
Gam is a wind user. In group battles, the presence or absence of a wind
user greatly affects the battle situation. So, I'm going to train him to
be able to protect the caravan."  
"..."  
"The problem is Jim. We're going to receive the Dragon Armament in the
Great Forest. But it needs repairs."  
"The Dragon Armament is the armor worn by the nameless magic warrior,
right? Are you saying it’s broken?"  
"Yeah. Because I broke it."  
"..."  
"Anyway, to repair the Dragon Armament, we need an earth and darkness
user. So, we have no choice but to rely on Hisui."  
"Me, repair Lord Jinrai's masterpiece?!"  
"You should be able to do it. As long as Hisu uses earth magic as well
as she usually does. Hisui can make golems, right?"  
"Yes, I'm not good at autonomous ones, but I'm good at remotely
controlling them. There are three of my homemade golems in the Mars
territory."  
  
Aoi said to the proud Hisui,  
  
"They're quite strong, right?"  
"Yes, not to brag, but they're strong."  
"Yeah, golems move better if you incorporate dark magic instead of just
powering them with magicules. Because dark magic can manipulate
gravity.  
I suspect Hisui unconsciously incorporated dark magic into the golems.
You can think of the Dragon Armament as an evolved version of a golem.  
The Dragon Armament is armor made of rare metal with high weight, high
hardness, and high anti-magic properties, combined with gravity
manipulation. Gravity manipulation with dark magicules on a material
that ordinary earth users can't even scratch. That's why it’s difficult
to repair.  
Right now, you're the only person I can think of who can repair it."  
"I understand. And what about Jim?"  
"That child, his swordsmanship seems unskilled, so he's not suited for
combat, but his magic is powerful.  
The earth magic he used to close the door was quite amazing. It took me
a lot to dispel it. So, I was wondering if we could train him to be
Hisui's assistant?"  
  
Jinrai's masterpiece, the Dragon Armament. It would be reassuring to
have the help of a skilled earth user to repair it. However, Hisui
wondered if that child was the right choice.  
  
"Why do you think that kid is suitable to be my assistant, Aoi?"  
"He's similar to Jinrai."  
"What do you mean?"  
"Oh, not in terms of looks or personality. It's the way he uses
magicules that's similar to Jinrai. Normally, earth users cover the
material with magicules, right?"  
"Yes, I can't think of any other way."  
"Jinrai kneads magicules into the material."  
"Really? Is that even possible?"  
"Jinrai did it. That child, Jim, does it too. Ah, Jim's magic doesn't
come close to Jinrai's.  
But Jim has the imagination of kneading magicules into the material. I
thought it might have a good influence on Hisui. In fact, when Jinrai
used golems, he never assembled and prepared them in advance. He
"kneaded" them from stone, imbuing them with earth magicules when
needed."  
  
Hisui was inwardly moved.  
  
(If I could knead magicules into materials, I could dramatically expand
the range of my magic!  
Whether it's iron or stone, I could freely change its shape. Lord Jinrai
kneaded magicules into stone and created golems on the spot! What an
innovative way to use magicules!)  
  
"I understand. I'll learn with Jim too."  
  
Hisui clenched her fist tightly.  
  
"Aoi, thank you. I had given up on growing any further on my own. I was
worried that I might not be able to help you as I am now.  
But just getting hints from Aoi about how to use dark and earth
magicules, I feel like I've found a clue to growth."  
"No, I only taught you about Jinrai's way of using earth magicules, I
can't teach you how to knead magicules into materials."  
  
Hisui had witnessed Aoi and the Cursed Swordsman's power and, facing the
great mission of lifting the barrier on the Demon Continent, had lost
confidence in her own abilities. But,  
  
(I want to be useful to Aoi. That's why I need power.)  
  
"I want power. Enough power to be allowed to stay by Aoi's side."  
  
(Otherwise, I won't be able to support Aoi, let alone overcome my own
fate...)  
  
"Hisui, you said you'd take half of my suffering. I was so happy. I
thought I could overcome anything with you.  
But you have to be able to overcome your own hardships too. I'll take
half of your suffering too."  
"Aoi, thank you. I'll do my best..."  
  
Aoi gently embraced Hisui's shoulder.  
  
"Well then, let's go to the cafeteria and greet the leader of the
caravan."
