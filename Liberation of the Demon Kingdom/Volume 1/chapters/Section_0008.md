# Chapter 8: A-Rank Knight

"My head hurts..."  
  
When Hisui came to, she was sleeping in bed in Aoi's room.  
  
(I hit it off with the customers at The Whimsy yesterday and drank too
much. Ugh, I have a headache…)  
  
Next to her, Aoi was lying there in her underwear.  
  
(Aoi drank so much too...)  
  
Suddenly, Hisui remembered something important.  
  
"Miss Aoi, wake up! We have to go to the royal castle!"  
"The royal castle? Let's do it next time. My head hurts, and I feel
sick..."  
"We can't do that. Please, Miss Aoi, wake up!!"  
  
Hisui had the reluctantly woken Aoi cast Healing on her.  
  
(It's really amazing! My hangover is gone...)  
  
It seemed Aoi had cast Healing on herself too. Completely different from
before, she had a refreshed expression.  
  
"Alright, let's get changed and leave right away! After all, we're going
to be late!"  
  
Hisui wore sky-blue pants and a jacket, while Aoi wore black shorts and
a white shirt. Over their clothes, they put on the magic armor they
bought at Jaspa's shop. Aoi's was navy blue, and Hisui's a pale
green—the magic armor was the same style but different colors. Then,
strapping swords to their waists, they hurried out of the house.  
This time, the gatekeepers let the two of them pass without issue. They
seemed frightened seeing Aoi, but the two didn't mind. When they passed
through the main gate, a young Royal Guard knight was waiting for
them.  
  
"I have been ordered by Commander Tsukumi to escort you both. Please
come this way."  
  
He treated them with very polite manners. As they walked down the long
corridors of the royal castle, Hisui was impressed by the luxurious
decorations.  
  
"Miss Aoi, are you familiar with the royal castle?"  
"Well, enough not to get lost."  
  
The young knight led them to the audience chamber with the king.  
  
(Eh? The audience chamber? Why?)  
  
Hisui was completely intimidated, but Aoi remained calm. The young
knight stood before the doors of the audience chamber and,  
  
"I have brought Lady Aoi and B-Rank Knight Hisui."  
  
He shouted in a loud voice. Then, the doors slowly opened from the
inside. And Hisui was once again astonished by the scene. High-ranking
Royal Guard knights stood in lines on both sides, saluting. Beyond them,
high-ranking civil officials were assembled. At the very back, on a
raised dais, was a throne where King Berg sat. Next to King Berg stood
Commander Tsukumi of the Royal Guard and Prime Minister Sagittarius.  
  
(This is just like a knighting ceremony!)  
  
Hisui was dumbfounded by the spectacle, but Aoi beside her was
unfazed.  
  
"B-Rank Knight Hisui, this way."  
"Hisui, come on."  
  
Prompted by Aoi, Hisui stepped forward before Berg.  
  
"Hisui, I hereby appoint you as an A-Rank Knight. You are to be assigned
to the Intelligence Division, Special Unit, and ordered to travel to the
Demon Kingdom as an envoy. All lords are obligated to cooperate with you
as a top priority to achieve your objective."  
  
(A-Rank? Envoy to the Demon Kingdom? What's going on?)  
  
"Hisui, step forward."  
  
As Hisui stepped further towards Berg, Tsukumi handed her a single
sword.  
  
"I bestow upon you this magic sword, Yagiri Raikou."  
  
Berg drew Yagiri from its scabbard, inspected the blade, then sheathed
it again and handed it to Hisui.  
  
"Yes, thank you."  
  
Hisui received the magic sword from Berg and held it respectfully.  
  
"Regarding the matter of the envoy to the Demon Kingdom, receive the
details and instructions from Commander Tsukumi of the Royal Guard."  
  
With those words, Berg left the audience chamber.  
  
"This concludes the proceedings. Dismissed."  
  
At Prime Minister Sagittarius' words, the assembled civil officials and
knights left the chamber.  
  
"Miss Aoi and Hisui, please come this way."  
  
Invited by Tsukumi, Aoi and Hisui moved to a separate room.
