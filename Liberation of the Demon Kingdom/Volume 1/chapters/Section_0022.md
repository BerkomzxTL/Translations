# Chapter 22: Two Guardians

"We’re truly sorry!!"  
  
Gam and Jim were taken to Aoi's room, where their restraints were
removed and they were made to sit in a formal kneeling position. By the
way, Aoi had healed their eyes with healing magic.  
  
"Which of you wants to die first?"  
  
Hisui drew her Yagiri and thrust it at Gam.  
  
"Aoi, trying to see Aoi naked is a crime worthy of death."  
"Hey Hisui, put that dangerous thing away."  
"But..."  
"Are you two reflecting on your actions?"  
  
Gam and Jim nodded repeatedly.  
  
"Alright, I'll give you a choice. Die, or become our servants."  
"Aoi, aren't you being too lenient? Shouldn't it be slowly tortured to
death, or be servants tormented by pain so great they wish they were
dead? Choose!"  
  
Gam and Jim trembled. The eyes of this long-haired woman (Hisui) were
serious.  
  
"P-Please spare us. It was just a momentary lapse."  
"Y-Yes, it was just a spontaneous thing."  
"I see. Then let's do this. You two are our servants from today on. Gam,
I'll teach you how to use magicules, so learn it. Jim, you'll learn
about magical tools from Hisui. Become good enough to be Hisui's
assistant. The period is one week. If you don't meet my expectations,
I’ll torture you to death."  
"W-What does that mean?"  
"Questions are not allowed. For now, you two go and get permission from
the caravan leader to accompany us. Now, hurry up!"  
  
Gam and Jim, not understanding what was going on, rushed down to the
inn's dining hall.
