# Chapter 10: Would You Like To Challenge Me?

"Well then, Miss Aoi, I will send members from the Royal Guard tomorrow.
Please make use of them as you see fit. Hisui, I will provide you with
as much support as possible too. Well, as long as you're with Miss Aoi,
your safety is guaranteed."  
"Okay, I understand. About Hisui, and about the future of the Demon
Continent. I'll talk properly with Dustis. Leave it to me."  
"Hearing you say *'Leave it to me,'* Miss Aoi, is reassuring, but please
don't push yourself too hard. You tend to act recklessly when it comes
to the Demon God of Chaos..."  
  
Aoi quietly shook her head at Tsukumi's words.  
  
"I must break free from the shackles the Demon God of Chaos placed on
me. This is my burden to bear."  
"Hisui. I know you also bear a heavy destiny. Knowing this, I ask you.
Please, lend Miss Aoi your strength."  
  
Tsukumi bowed deeply to Hisui. Tsukumi's words carried great weight and
resonated in Hisui's heart.  
  
"Yes, though my power is little."  
"Also, Miss Aoi. The Intelligence Division will send regular
communications, so I need a little blood from you."  
"Ehhh? No way. I hate pain."  
"Don't say that. Hold out your hand."  
  
Aoi turned her face away, squeezing her eyes shut tightly.  
  
"Don't make it hurt. Is it over yet??"  
"I'm about to start. You get covered in blood swinging your sword
around, so what's so bad about this?"  
"Why, you ask? Isn't it unpleasant to be hurt knowingly? That's why I
dislike doctors."  
"Okay, all done. I'll heal it up for you."  
  
Aoi's wound healed instantly, leaving no trace.  
  
"With this, we can send carrier pigeons directly to you for
communication."  
  
Aoi glared resentfully at the pleased-looking Amano.  
  
"Next, Miss Hisui, if you please."  
"By the way, Miss Aoi, do you have any plans for the rest of today? If
you have time, I'd like to introduce some members of the Royal Guard."  
  
Aoi grinned and replied.  
  
"Hmm, let's save that for another time. Today, I was hoping to borrow
the Royal Guard's training grounds. Is that alright?"  
"I don't mind, but..."  
"Hisui, want to have a match with me?"  
  
â€”  
  
At the training grounds, Tsukumi, Amano, and Fuselnia were observing.  
  
"Miss Amano, what kind of observation is this?"  
"Fufufu, you're bound to be surprised..."  
  
Before their eyes, Aoi and Hisui stood ready with swords. Hisui drew the
magic sword gifted by Berg, Yagiri, holding it in an upper stance.  
  
(What an incredible sword. I feel like I could cut through anything.)  
  
Hisui was deeply moved by Yagiri. Her face naturally softened into a
smile.  
  
"Hisui, I won't hold back."  
  
(Whoops, gotta focus.)  
  
At Aoi's words, Hisui collected herself and readjusted her grip on
Yagiri.  
  
In contrast, Aoi held a training sword in her left hand, her stance
seemingly full of openings.  
  
(As expected, I can't sense any power from Miss Aoi at all. But I'm
afraid to strike.)  
  
"Hisui, show me your magic too."  
"Yes, but are you sure?"  
"Hmm? Ah, yeah, it's fine."  
"Alright, here I go."  
  
Hisui clumped her magicules together. Then, infusing them into the
ground, she sent countless pebbles flying towards Aoi.  
  
"Oh, impressive."  
  
Aoi pointed her right hand forward and released magicules. This magical
technique, called Resist, involves deploying one's own magicules to
defend against magical attacks. It's a type of barrier. Resist is an
advanced technique said to require C-Rank proficiency or higher.  
The user expends more energy resisting than the power of the attack
received. Therefore, focusing solely on defense can consume all one's
magicules deployment capacity, creating an opening.  
Hisui's strategy was to force Aoi to concentrate on Resisting by
launching innumerable pebbles.  
  
(Now!)  
  
Hisui dashed towards Aoi, who was "focused" on Resisting, and swung
Yagiri upwards from a low stance. However, Hisui's full-force strike was
deflected by Aoi's training sword. Yagiri left Hisui's hand, spun
through the air, and stabbed into the ground.  
  
"How did you do that just now?"  
"I repelled Hisui's sword with light magicules."  
  
Hisui couldn't believe Aoi's casual explanation.  
  
(But Miss Aoi should have been fully occupied with Resist. To think she
could deflect my sword strike while Resisting...)  
  
"Dark magicules reside within you. Hisui, try the same attack one more
time. But this time, try infusing it with dark magicules."  
  
Hisui was perplexed.  
  
"Dark magicules, you say?"  
"That's right. It's all about imagination. Try enveloping the earth
magicules with dark magicules. Imagine the dark magicules covering the
pebbles."  
  
Hisui recalled the dark magicules she had seen on the Sugal Plains.
Those gentle particles. Imagining those dark particles enveloping the
pebbles imbued with earth magicules, Hisui gathered her magicules.  
  
"Here I come!"  
  
The torrent of pebbles Hisui unleashed flew towards Aoi. Hisui noticed
that the earth magicules she had imbued were being contained by the dark
magicules, not dissipating.  
  
(I see. The power isn't scattering.)  
  
Aoi Resisted just as before. Then, as Hisui rushed in and swung Yagiri
upwards from a low stance, her attack was blocked by Aoi's sword, but
Yagiri did not leave her hand this time.  
  
"Good, you properly channeled dark magicules into Yagiri too. Now you
just need to get used to it bit by bit."  
  
The sword Aoi held was broken at the hilt.  
  
Fuselnia was astonished by their match.  
  
(Hisui's handling of magicules is worthy of an A-Rank knight. Her
swordsmanship is also impeccable. Above all, the power of that magic
sword suits Hisui well.  
More importantly! Who is that girl, Aoi? Her magicule capacity and
swordsmanship are on a completely different level.)  
  
"Miss Aoi, would you give me a training session too? It's been a
while."  
  
Fuselnia was stunned by Tsukumi's request.  
  
(The Commander asking *'Please train me'* ?! No, no, how could that
be??)  
  
"Tsukumi. Sure, but I won't hold back."  
"Yes, thank you."  
  
Aoi placed the broken sword aside.  
  
"Hisui, could I borrow Yagiri?"  
  
Aoi accepted Yagiri from Hisui, drew it from its sheath, and held it in
a two-handed stance. Seeing her, Hisui felt goosebumps rise on her
skin.  
  
(S-Strong! Miss Aoi is unbelievably strong.)  
  
"Here I come."  
  
Tsukumi drew her sword, coating the blade in light magicules, and closed
the distance to Aoi with incredible speed. The three spectators gasped
at the swiftness. It was a full-power strike from Tsukumi that no one
doubted Aoi could lose to. But,  
  
"!"  
  
Tsukumi's horizontal slash, fully charged with magicules, was
effortlessly blocked by Aoi's Yagiri.  
  
"You blocked that?!"  
  
Tsukumi attempted a second strike, but Aoi backstepped, creating
distance and escaping Tsukumi's range. Then, she gathered magicules in
her right hand.  
  
"Catch this properly."  
  
Aoi fired the magicules from her right hand as a bullet of light towards
Tsukumi. With unbelievable reaction speed, Tsukumi slashed the bullet
with her sword.  
  
"Kuh!"  
  
In that instant, the bullet of light burst, emitting a bright flash. For
a moment, Tsukumi's vision was stolen.  
  
"Too bad!!"  
  
Using that momentary opening, Aoi circled behind Tsukumi and pressed
Yagiri against her neck.  
  
"I yield."  
  
Everyone was in disbelief at Tsukumi's declaration of defeat.  
  
(Commander Tsukumi, defeated so easily... Who on earth is that
girl...?)  
  
Fuselnia couldn't believe what had just happened before her eyes. She
turned to Amano beside her, pleading for an explanation, but...  
  
"There's no way I could explain that."  
  
...she was brushed off. Yet another worry was added to Fuselnia's
troubles.
