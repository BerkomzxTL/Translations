# Chapter 6: Royal Cuisine and Magic Tools.

"I only returned to the Royal Capital seven days ago. Right after you
collapsed, Hisui. I had also fallen ill and was recuperating. So it's
been a while since I came to the Royal Castle or saw Berg."  
"I was surprised to learn that Miss Aoi is His Majesty's child."  
"..."  
"But I don't mind things like that."  
"Oh, right. More importantly, let's go get something to eat. The food
here is delicious."  
  
With that, Aoi said,  
  
"Follow me."  
  
She strode briskly through the castle. Then, entering the murderous
atmosphere of the pre-lunch kitchen, she pushed past the cooks and stood
before a middle-aged woman wearing a conspicuously tall chef's hat. She
was a remarkably energetic woman, and Hisui worried nervously if they
would get scolded.  
  
"If it isn't Aoi!"  
"Miss Machi, long time no see! Do you remember me?"  
"Of course. Are you feeling better now?"  
"Yeah, getting there, I suppose. I came here today because I wanted to
eat your cooking, Miss Machi. I'd love to have some roasted mountain
pigeon."  
"Really? That makes me happy. Alright, leave it to me! I'll treat you to
some incredibly delicious mountain pigeon."  
"Head Chef, we won't make the meal for the knight order in time!"  
"Tell Fuselnia to wait a bit."  
  
Today was the day the Fussel territory's knight order was participating
in the regular training exercises with the Royal Guard Knights. Fuselnia
was scheduled to greet them before the exercises but couldn't because of
Aoi, and ended up receiving sarcastic remarks from the Fussel Knight
Commander. Additionally, the meal for the social gathering was delayed,
and Fuselnia once again had a stomach-churning time placating the Fussel
Knight Commander's sarcasm.  
  
"It's truly delicious. Even though it's a staple of outdoor cooking,
it's presented so beautifully and tastes amazing! It's incredible."  
"Right? As expected, the key is adaptability."  
"Miss Aoi really is a mysterious person."  
  
Hisui envied Aoi's carefree nature. Could she, who had made a living as
a knight defending the border, truly be of any use to Aoi?  
  
"Hisui, you were thinking about something difficult, weren't you? It's
written all over your face. Our work starts tomorrow, after we talk with
Tsukumi. It's bound to be a tough mission. We'll get the details then.
Until then, let's just enjoy ourselves."  
"Yes..."  
"Alright, it's decided! Miss Machi, I want dessert!!"  
  
"Let's buy some clothes! Apparently, the Royal Guard Knights are footing
the bill, so maybe we should buy a little extra?"  
"That's a waste of taxpayer money... Besides, I have nowhere to wear
them."  
"No, no, cute clothes are important. It's not that you have nowhere to
wear them; you go out \*because\* you have cute clothes to wear!"  
  
Aoi said this plausible-sounding thing with a smug look on her face.  
  
(Miss Aoi is right. An assignment directly from His Majesty Berg
couldn't possibly be easy. So, maybe it's okay to enjoy myself a little
bit now.)  
  
"Miss Aoi, let's go to the clothes shop! I also want to go to the tools
store. I want to see magic swords!"  
"So you like magic swords, Hisui. Alright, then let's go look at some
magic swords first. I'll introduce you to a shop I know!"  
  
The place Aoi brought Hisui to was a weapon shop with a sign reading
"Jaspa's Shop".  
  
(Jaspa... that's the same name as the adjutant of one of the Six Heroes,
Lord Jinrai!)  
  
For Hisui, who loved magic swords, Jinrai was a revered name, a master
craftsman of magic swords. She had devoured every available book about
Jinrai, turning into a "Jinrai otaku".  
  
"He's a skilled craftsman."  
  
Aoi said this and opened the shop door.  
  
"Hmph, I've got no weapons to sell to a little lady who doesn't even
give off a hint of magicules! Get outta here quick before I throw you
out!"  
  
The moment she opened the door, they were showered with angry shouts.  
  
"Jaspa, same as ever, huh? You won't sell to me either?"  
  
Hearing Aoi's voice, Jaspa burst out from the back of the shop.  
  
"Miss Aoi!"  
  
His face was smeared with tears and snot.  
  
"Hey now, Jaspa, that's gross."  
  
Aoi quickly dodged away from Jaspa and stepped behind Hisui.  
  
"My apologies. But to think I'd meet you again, Miss Aoi. After hearing
you were badly injured three years ago, I lost track of you... I was so
worried..."  
"My body's fine now. Besides, the *'thing'* Jinrai left behind is still
entrusted to the Great Forest. I can't afford to stay down."  
"Huh? Jinrai... are you really Mr. Jaspa, Lord Jinrai's adjutant?"  
"Ah, yes, I am. Miss Aoi, who is this young lady?"  
"This is Hisui. She's my partner."  
"To be called Miss Aoi's partner!! Incredible!"  
"To meet Lord Jinrai's adjutant, Mr. Jaspa... I'm so lucky!"  
  
After that, Hisui and Jaspa immediately hit it off and began talking
excitedly over each other at incredible speed.  
  
"My feelings towards Lord Jinrai's magic swords ⚪︎↑？⚪︎⚪︎×, but to meet
Mr. Jaspa, ↑↑kyaaーー."  
"To be called Miss Aoi's partner is amazing! And Master Jinrai's
feelings towards his magic swords are ⚪︎×-〒."  
  
Aoi watched the two of them with exasperation, but quickly grew bored.  
  
"I'm just going to take a look at the armorー."  
  
Aoi's words didn't reach the pair at all.
