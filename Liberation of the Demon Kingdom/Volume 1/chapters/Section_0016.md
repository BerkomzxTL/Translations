# Chapter 16: Attack

That night, they invited Arcadia out for drinks at a pub frequented by
the Royal Capital's Royal Guard Knights. Arcadia was scared of Aoi the
entire time, while Aoi, in turn, was considerate towards him. However,
both Aoi and Hisui were grateful to Arcadia for the preparations he had
made this time.  
  
"Arcadia. Thank you. This is a gift from us."  
  
Aoi handed Arcadia a silver bracelet.  
  
"Thank you very much! I will treasure it like a family heirloom!"  
  
Aoi and Hisui gave wry smiles at Arcadia's reaction as they left the
pub. They parted ways with Arcadia in front of the establishment.  
  
"I pray for the safe success of your mission!"  
  
Sent off by his loud voice, Aoi and Hisui turned back and waved
broadly.  
  
And then.  
  
"Hisui, let's take them down on the bridge just a little way in from the
central plaza. There's one guy with a strange aura."  
"Yes, Iâ€™ll target their legs with stones to neutralize them."  
"Understood. Nine of them? They're really overdoing it for a couple of
girls like us."  
  
Aoi walked forward nonchalantly, with Hisui walking two steps behind.  
  
"The bridge is just ahead."  
  
Just then, they were unexpectedly accosted by four rough-looking drunk
men.  
  
"Hey there, cute ladies. Come have a drink with us. Just for a little
while."  
"Hisui, I'll handle the one with the nasty aura behind us. You take care
of the others."  
"Ooh, happy to hear you'll take me on! And your friend there will handle
everyone else? I like that."  
"Hisui, let's go."  
  
At Aoi's signal, Hisui simultaneously launched eight fist-sized stones.
The stones began to whirl around her.  
  
"Go!"  
  
At Hisui's shout, the whirling stones shot out and shattered the legs of
the men who were drawing their swords and charging.  
  
"Guh."  
  
(Missed two!)  
  
Hisui immediately drew Yagiri and attacked one of the men she missed
with an overhead strike. The man quickly deflected the path of Hisui's
sword with his own, but this was within Hisui's calculations.  
  
(Fighting like a knight?)  
  
Hisui didn't add extra force to the deflected blade, simply adjusting
its trajectory to cut the man's knee. The other man charged with a spear
readied, but she gathered magicules and launched a stone from beneath
his feet, shattering his jaw.  
  
"What about Miss Aoi?"  
  
The man Aoi was facing held a cursed sword.  
  
(Its power is much weaker than the one the swordsman had the other day,
but it's still a magic sword that radiates an unpleasant power.)  
  
"Hee hee hee, with this sword, I'm invincible!"  
  
The man raised his sword into an overhead stance.  
  
"I'll take your magicules."  
  
Aoi sighed softly, sheathed Nijimaru, and took an iai stance.  
  
"Whenever you're ready."  
  
Hisui felt a chill, worried Aoi's magicules would be devoured by the
cursed sword's power, but her fears were unfounded.  
The cursed sword the man swung seemed to start absorbing Aoi's
magicules, but...  
  
"W-What are you?!"  
  
Nijimaru, still sheathed by Aoi, began emitting an overwhelming amount
of light magicules. The man's cursed sword couldn't absorb Aoi's immense
amount of magicules.  
  
"You need to take it properly."  
  
Aoi drew Nijimaru from its sheath and swung it forward, and a torrent of
light surged towards the man like a blade.  
  
"!!"  
  
The blade of light shattered the man's cursed sword to pieces and even
broke his expensive-looking armor, but the man himself was unharmed.
Though he had passed out, the whites of his eyes showing...  
  
"Hmph! How was my technique? Hisui!"  
"Miss Aoi, the evidence is in pieces..."  
  
Aoi panicked at Hisui's calm remark.  
  
"Ah, oops! I misjudged the amount of force."  
  
The drunk men who had accosted the pair were terrified by their
overwhelming sword skills. Huddled together, they trembled, regretting
ever having called out to the girls.
