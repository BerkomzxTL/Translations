# Chapter 3: Aoi and Hisui

Hisui changed into the clothes Aoi had prepared and left the hospital
room.  
"This is the first time I've worn such lovely clothes. Do they suit me?
My duty was border patrol in the borderlands, so... I never had the
chance to wear something nice."  
  
Hisui was wearing gray pants and a jacket. It suited her slender figure
well. Finding Hisui's shyness endearing, Aoi replied.  
  
"Don't worry! It suits you very well. You're beautiful, Hisui."  
  
Aoi gave Hisui's shoulder a light pat.  
  
"Alright then, let's buy some food at a shop and go to my place."  
  
Hisui was grateful for Aoi's consideration. Being alone in the hospital
was lonely. She would likely have become anxious thinking about the
future. Since receiving the healing, Hisui had felt favorably towards
Aoi.  
  
(I'm glad Miss Aoi is here. My anxiety has lessened a bit.)  
  
Lost in such thoughts, Hisui followed after Aoi.  
  
"Next time I'll give you a proper tour of the Royal Capital. Although, I
don't know it that well myself. Today, let's get food at *‘The
Whimsy’*."  
  
Saying that, Aoi stopped by a lone shop standing dimly lit in the
growing darkness. The shop was very busy and smelled wonderful.  
  
"It smells great, doesn't it? Today they have herb-grilled swordfish.
Hmm, the beef tripe tomato stew looks delicious too."  
"Aoi, it doesn't just \*look\* delicious, it \*is\* delicious!"  
  
A kind-looking, stout middle-aged man called out from the back.  
  
"Uncle, do you have the swordfish, the tripe stew, and also bread?"  
"We have white bread!"  
"Okay, two of the bread too, to go!"  
  
Aoi turned back and said proudly to Hisui.  
  
"Uncle's cooking is the best! Though he never makes what I want to
eat."  
"That's why it's on a whim! Here, be careful carrying this. Haven't seen
your face before, young lady."  
"My name is Hisui. I just arrived in the Royal Capital recently."  
"Is that so? Well, keep coming back."  
  
Seeing his friendly smile, Hisui suddenly remembered how hungry she
was.  
  
"Next, I'll show you to my home!"  
  
Saying that, Aoi unlocked a warehouse behind The Whimsy and went
inside.  
Inside the warehouse was a vast, open space.  
  
(It's built like a training ground for knights. Might be just right for
practicing swordsmanship or magic.)  
  
The back of the warehouse was sectioned off by a wall, with a
heavy-looking door set into it.  
  
(What a forbidding door. Is this Miss Aoi's room? Maybe the hospital
would be better.)  
  
Just as Hisui was feeling a little regret, the heavy-looking door
opened.  
  
"Welcome! To my home."  
  
Beyond the door spread a very cozy space. There was a small sofa, and in
front of it, a fireplace was installed. On the wall hung a painting of
the Six Heroes, drawn with a warm touch. The pictures Hisui knew of the
Six Heroes mostly featured valiant motifs with everyone holding swords,
but in this painting, the six were smiling with gentle expressions. What
particularly caught her eye was that the Magic Warrior, who should have
been robust and clad in magic armor, was depicted as extremely petite.  
  
"It's a warm painting."  
  
Aoi looked pleased at the words Hisui murmured.  
  
"Yeah, it's a nice painting, right? Someone I used to travel with drew
it for me."  
"There's a bath and kitchen too. I'll go run the hot water now, so
please, go ahead and use the bath first."  
  
The bath had a faucet—a magic tool embedded with fire and water magic
stones—from which warm water flowed. The kitchen was fully equipped with
pots and other cooking utensils, featuring a two-burner magical tool
stove embedded with fire magic stones, and even a faucet embedded with a
water magic stone.  
  
"Miss Aoi, who exactly are you? You don't often find a home this
luxurious. Just based on the facilities, it's on par with a Count's
mansion."  
"I'm just a 'failure'."  
  
Hisui swallowed the words, "A what?" Because Aoi was wearing a very
lonely smile.  
  
"Now, first, go take a bath and freshen up. You haven't washed in over
ten days, right?"  
  
Hearing that, Hisui writhed in embarrassment.  
  
(Oh, I might stink.)  
  
"I-I'm sorry. I must smell awful."  
"No, no, not at all. If anything, it's an alluring scent."  
  
Slipping past the grinning Aoi, Hisui headed for the bath.  
  
"Th-Then I'll take a bath."  
  
—  
  
"Ahh, this feels good."  
  
While soaking in the bathtub, Hisui thought about her current assignment
orders.  
  
(It's impossible for orders directly from His Majesty Berg to be issued
to a mere squad leader. What have I gotten myself into? The Intelligence
Division... Can I really handle it? Miss Aoi is a mystery too. We don't
seem that different in age, yet she’s treated so well. She must have a
knightly rank, but I don't sense any strength from her... And it's
strange for a mere knight's home to have such expensive magic tools.)  
  
In the Asura Kingdom, magic tools embedded with magic stones were
gradually starting to spread, but they were still quite expensive.  
  
(I remember seeing a magic tool for boiling water at the Count's
mansion. I wonder how much a magic tool that fills the bath with hot
water must cost.)  
  
Her rambling thoughts were interrupted by Aoi.  
  
"Hisui, I'll leave some nightwear out for you, so get changed into
it."  
"Okay, thank you very much."  
  
Hisui wanted to soak in the tub a little longer, but her hunger felt
unbearable, so she decided to get out of the bath quickly.  
In the changing area, a clean towel and a robe were prepared, which
Hisui gratefully decided to use.  
When she returned to the room, a table had been set up in front of the
sofa, and along with the side dishes from The Whimsy, salad and pasta
were served on plates.  
  
"It's just simple cooking, though."  
  
Aoi uncorked a bottle of wine and poured it into one of the two
glasses.  
  
"Can you drink, Hisui?"  
"Yes, about average."  
"Then, here you go too."  
  
Aoi poured wine into the other glass as well.  
  
"Welcome to the Royal Capital."  
  
Eating and chatting with Aoi, Hisui felt a sense of peace.  
  
(Is it because she healed me?)  
  
Neither Aoi nor Hisui spoke of the Order of Chaos. For some reason,
Hisui wasn't nervous about the summons from Captain Tsukumi of the Royal
Guard in two days. This was because she felt truly relieved that Aoi had
said she would accompany her.  
  
(Why is that? It's strange. Meeting Captain Tsukumi should be
unthinkable...)  
  
Does Aoi have the power to give people peace of mind? Being with Marsim
had been fun too, but she hadn't felt this sense of tranquility.  
  
(I couldn't give a proper goodbye to Marsim...)  
  
Still. Aoi was utterly defenseless.  
  
(If she's an Intelligence Division squad leader, she should be B-Rank or
higher, but I don't sense any strength from her at all.)  
"How is it? Delicious?"  
  
Hisui's thoughts were interrupted by Aoi's question.  
  
"Yes, it's very delicious."  
  
Of course the side dishes from The Whimsy were good, but the salad Aoi
made—lettuce topped with crispy fried bacon and cheese—and the tomato
pasta with scallops were also very tasty. The pasta went especially well
with the wine.  
  
"Miss Aoi, you're a great cook. I can only make campfire food."  
"It's all about application. Even campfire food can become royal cuisine
depending on how you prepare it."  
"Wow. Could even a roasted mountain pigeon become royal cuisine?"  
"I think it'd be fine. That's right! Let's go eat out tomorrow! I was
feeling like complaining a little."  
"Complain?"  
"No, no, that's just my thing. Hisui, you must be tired. Use the bed in
that room today."  
"That's your bed, isn't it, Miss Aoi? Are you sure?"  
"Ah, I can sleep anywhere."  
(But this sofa looks small and cramped.)  
  
Thinking this, Hisui made a suggestion that surprised even herself.  
  
"If it's alright with you, Miss Aoi, why don't we share?"  
"Alright. But it'll be cramped."  
  
Hisui felt a little anxious about the future, so she wanted the
reassurance of being near Aoi.  
  
"If that's decided, we need to get up a bit early tomorrow, so let's
clean up and get ready for bed."  
  
Saying that, Aoi took the empty plates to the kitchen.  
  
"I'll help too."  
"Thanks. After we clean up, help me get the bedding ready."  
  
"Miss Aoi, thank you for everything today. I was feeling anxious. But
now I feel at ease. I truly think I'm fortunate to be assigned to Aoi
Squad."  
  
As soon as they had both slipped into bed, Hisui told Aoi how she was
feeling.  
  
"Likewise, it's good to have you. Our work starts in two days. Tomorrow,
after we eat, I'll show you around the Royal Capital. Though, like I
said, I don't know it that well myself."  
"Thank you! I'm looking forward to it."  
"Hisui?"  
  
After that, there was no reply from Hisui to Aoi's call.  
  
(She must be exhausted.)  
  
Aoi gazed at Hisui's sleeping face while thinking about her plans for
tomorrow.  
  
(You might be my "other half"...)
