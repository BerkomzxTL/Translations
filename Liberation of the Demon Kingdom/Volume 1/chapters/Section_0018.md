# Chapter 18: Departure

The next day, the two woke up early before sunrise and prepared for
their journey. Aoi wore navy blue shorts, a white shirt, and a magical
breastplate, with two swords tucked into her waist. Over that, she put
on a black jacket. Hisui wore grey shorts, a white shirt, and a magical
breastplate, with a magic sword tucked into her waist. She wore a
matching jacket to Aoi's over her clothes.  
  
"Alright, let's go pick up our luggage at the royal castle!"  
  
Arcadia was waiting in front of the main gate of the royal castle.  
  
"This way, please."  
  
Passing through the main gate, they found two Gamou birds in a plaza on
the way to the royal palace. Gamou birds are large, flightless birds
often used by soldiers and merchants for long-distance travel. They’re
strong and can endure long periods of running while carrying two
adults.  
  
Luggage was strapped onto the two Gamou birds, and they were also
equipped with riding gear.  
  
"The details of the luggage are listed here, please check them. Also,
here is a personal letter for Queen Dustis, directives for the various
lords, and Lady Aoi's identification papers."  
"Arcadia, thank you."  
  
Aoi confirmed that her identification pass was D-Rank and thanked
Arcadia.  
  
"Well then, we'll be going."  
"Lady Aoi, Miss Hisui, please wait a moment."  
  
Arcadia held back the Gamou birds with a desperate look on his face.  
  
"Is there something else?"  
"Aoi, allow me to see you off as well."  
  
Turning around, they saw King Berg and Commander Tsukumi approaching.  
  
"Thank you both for coming so early in the morning!"  
"This is a parting gift for you two. They are ancient treasured swords
passed down through the royal family."  
  
Saying so, Berg handed two daggers, one each to Aoi and Hisui.  
  
"Originally, they’re meant to be wielded as a pair... but here is one
for each of you. If you infuse them with magicules, they can even slice
through mithril. I await your safe return!"  
"Miss Aoi, Hisui, we await your safe return."  
"Yeah, we're off."  
"We're going."  
  
In the spring of the year 506 of the Bres calendar, Aoi and Hisui set
off on a journey to the Demon Continent. To unleash their own destiny.
