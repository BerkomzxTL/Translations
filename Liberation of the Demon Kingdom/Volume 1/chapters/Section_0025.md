# Chapter 25: Jinrai's Magic

That night, while Aoi, for some reason, hit it off with Onjin and
started a drinking contest, Hisui was talking with Jim while eating at a
table. By the way, Gam was being used as Aoi's alcohol server.  
  
"Where did you learn earth magic, Jim?"  
"No, I haven't learned any magic. I just admired and imitated an earth
user who stayed in my village when I was a child and made magical
tools."  
"Could it be that the village you lived in was Bueno Village?"  
"Yes, that's right. But how did you know?"  
  
(I knew it. That's where Lord Jinrai's magic sword workshop was.)  
  
"Jim, please infuse this stone with magicules."  
  
Hisui took a fist-sized stone out of her pocket and placed it in front
of Jim.  
  
"Yes, like this?"  
  
Jim infused the stone with magicules. The magicules covered the surface
of the stone and "permeated" into the inside.  
Hisui felt like scales were falling from her eyes.  
  
(I see! He's assimilating the magicules in the stone with his own!)  
  
Hisui took out another stone from her pocket and assimilated her own
magicules into the stone in the same way as Jim.  
  
"!"  
  
Hisui's magicules permeated the stone and became one with it. Hisui
quietly changed the magicules little by little. It slowly but surely
deformed the shape of the stone. Slowly, slowly. The stone eventually
took the shape of a girl. In the form of Aoi.  
Hisui was so happy she wanted to dance.  
  
(I did it, I did it, I did it!! I can do something like this!! Amazing!
Amazing! Amazing! I have to tell Aoi!)  
  
"Ao...i"  
  
What Hisui saw when she turned around was a drunk Aoi happily stroking
Gam's head vigorously. Hisui was looking at that figure and was once
again grateful to Aoi.  
  
(Aoi, I can still grow stronger. I'll work hard so I can stand next to
you.)  
  
"Miss Hisui, that's amazing. I can't do anything like that."  
  
Jim's voice brought Hisui back to her senses.  
  
"Jim, let's practice with various materials starting tomorrow. I think
it will be good practice for creating magical tools."  
"Yes, Miss Hisui. I look forward to working with you!"  
  
Hisui waved to Jim and went to Aoi's side. The members of the merchant
caravan were collapsed around Aoi, passed out from drinking.  
  
"Hahaha! Hisui. Everyone is so sloppy. Here, here, Gam, pour drinks for
everyone!"  
  
Gam had his face buried in Aoi's chest and looked happy. Then, when Gam
raised his eyes, he saw Hisui standing there with a terrifying face.  
  
"How indecent... Get away from Aoi!"  
  
Hisui kneaded magicules to create iron, then permeated the iron with
magicules to make it into a rope, and bound Gam tightly.  
  
"Oho, Hisui is amazing. Looks like Jinrai."  
  
After that, Aoi was carried to her room by Hisui.
