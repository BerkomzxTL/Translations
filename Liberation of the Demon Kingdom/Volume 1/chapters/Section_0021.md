# Chapter 21: Call Me Aoi.

A little before the two of them went to take a bath, Gam and Jim were
talking about the girls they had seen in the dining hall earlier.  
  
"They were both so cute. Like angels."  
"They had good bodies, didn't they? I was mesmerized."  
"Which one do you prefer, Jim?"  
"Well, I'd say the one with the long hair. Gam, you liked the one with
the short hair, right?"  
"You know me so well."  
  
It was a trivial conversation. Then, the two of them saw the girls who
were the topic of their conversation heading towards the bath with
towels.  
  
The two were fledgling mercenaries. They had no combat experience yet.
They were able to get this escort job through Gam's father's
connections. The area around the royal capital is patrolled by the Royal
Knights, so there’s almost no danger. His father foresaw this and pushed
them into escorting the merchant caravan. Normally, mercenaries on a
mission avoid unnecessary trouble. Having a bad reputation would
interfere with their next job. But the two were just starting out, and
moreover, they were driven by the passion of adolescence.  
  
"Jim, how about we take a little peek?"  
  
And so, the two decided to sneak into the women's bath. Gam used wind
magic to confirm that there were only two girls in the bath. Jim used
earth magic to secure the door leading to the changing room so that it
wouldn't open, and Gam used wind magic to mask their presence as they
approached the door leading to the bath.  
They could hear the girls talking from inside.  
  
"Jim, I'm going to open the door."  
  
Gam slowly opened the door just a little. When they looked through the
door into the bath, they saw the two of them soaking in the tub.  
  
"Damn, I can't see."  
"Hey, let me see."  
  
The two of them clung to the gap in the door. Their bodies were hidden
in the tub, but they could see the girls' faces. Their faces, flushed
pink from the warm water, were very beautiful.  
  
"How beautiful."  
"Hey, Jim. The one with the short hair is getting up!"  
  
The two of them stared intently with their eyes wide open.  
  
Gam and Jim were supposed to have seen Aoi naked. However,  
  
"Ugh, my eyes, my eyes are burning!!"  
  
Aoi, who had stood up, created a ball of light infused with magicules
and made it shine intensely. She positioned it in front of her body to
create a shadow for Hisui.  
  
"Hmph, I showed them!"  
  
Hisui immediately approached the two who were rolling around covering
their eyes and buried them in the sand with earth magic, then hardened
it. Especially around their eyes, so they couldn't see. Just enough so
they could barely breathe.  
  
"Miss Aoi, you startled me. I thought you were really going to show
them."  
  
"Hehe, I wouldn't show them that easily. By the way, Hisui, you said
something strange. *'No one but me is allowed to see!'* Don’t worry, I
won't let anyone but Hisui see."  
  
Aoi said to Hisui with a happy grin.  
  
"Please forget it."  
"Eh?"  
"I said, please forget it!"  
"Miss Hisui, are you getting possessive of me?"  
"It's not like that."  
"Then, what is it?"  
  
Aoi asked in a gentle voice while placing her hand on Hisui's cheek.  
  
"Just, please forget it! Ah, that's right! Maybe if I hit your head,
you'll forget!"  
"That's right! Not. Hisui is dangerous."  
  
Aoi took her hand from Hisui's cheek and placed it on Hisui's lips.  
  
"Okay, I'll forget it. But, there's a condition!"  
"W-w-what is it?"  
"I've been wondering about it for a while. Hisui, you call me Miss Aoi,
right? Just call me Aoi."  
"B-b-but I'm embarrassed."  
"*’No one but me can look!’* "  
"O-o-okay. I get it. I'll call you that, Miss Aoi!"  
"You don't get it! What will you call me?"  
"Aoi... Ah, I understand! Aoi! Is that okay?"  
"Yeah, from now on, please call me Aoi."  
  
Aoi stroked Hisui's cheek to her neck with a satisfied look.  
  
"Okay, Aoi. Let's get dressed soon. We'll catch a cold. And, after we
get dressed, we'll kill these guys!"  
"Yes, Hisui. I get it."
