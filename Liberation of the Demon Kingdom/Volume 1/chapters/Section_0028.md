# Chapter 28: Special Training

The journey to the Barlmin territory continued peacefully without
incident. Along the way, Hisui, along with Jim, found time to work on
sculptures made of magicule-infused materials. They learned that the
more difficult a material was to refine, the harder it was to handle.
Iron was harder than stone, gold was harder than iron, and mithril
harder than gold. Gems were even more difficult to handle.  
  
"Minerals created under special conditions are difficult to read the
magicules of.."  
  
So Hisui said, but to Aoi, Hisui's ability to perform precise work on
stones was already abnormal, and being able to work with gems seemed to
belong to the realm of the gods. Jim could change the shape of stones
and carve them, but at most he could only create simple shapes like
spheres.  
  
"It will be good practice for controlling magicules, so let's try to
make this out of iron before we arrive in Barlmin."  
  
With that, Hisui created a tomato out of stone.  
  
"The shape is simple, but reproducing the stem requires careful control
of magicules. Do your best."  
"Yes, Master! I'll do my best."  
  
Meanwhile, Gam was being trained hard by Aoi.  
  
"It's hard to teach if I don't know your limits. First, let's use mana
until you're just about out of magicules."  
  
Aoi said, and then created arrows of light.  
  
"I'm going to shoot these arrows of light at you, so try releasing some
magicules in front of you!"  
"Miss Aoi, isn't this resistance training? I'll run out of magicules
quickly if I do that."  
"That's the point, so it doesn't matter. You'll die if you don't duck
properly."  
  
Aoi said that and then created multiple flashy-looking arrows of light
and shot them at Gam. Aoi's arrows of light were actually more for show
and didn't have much power, but Gam was desperate.  
  
"Mis Aoi, wait a minute!"  
"I can't wait. Here, more and more are coming."  
  
In reality, Gam's handling of magicules was rough. After taking three
hits from the arrows of light (which were very weak), he couldn't
move.  
  
"Gam is not good at controlling magicules."  
  
Looking down at the immobilized Gam, Aoi placed her hand on Gam's
forehead and healed him.  
  
"Amazing..."  
  
Then, Gam, who had been unable to move due to a lack of magicules,
regained his strength.  
  
"Until we enter the Barlmin territory, Gam will use wind magic to keep
this floating above your head, except when you're sleeping."  
  
Aoi said that and then handed Gam a 10cm square piece of paper.  
"This...?"  
"Yeah. If you drop it, I'll tell Hisui that Gam touched my butt."  
"P, please stop. I'll be killed."  
  
Gam was very afraid of Hisui.  
  
"Well then, do your best."
