# Chapter 1: Borderlands - Encounter -

**Volume 1: The Capital**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Borderlands  
  
Spring, Year 506 of the Bres calendar, Mars Territory, Asura Kingdom  
  
Today, Hisui turns 18. At 15, she joined the Mars Territory Army of her
homeland as an "Earth User".  
  
Users possess an affinity for one of the elements—fire, water, wind,
earth, light, or dark—and cannot use two types of magicules. Barring
special exceptions.  
  
Hisui possesses innate talent, and currently serves as a B-Rank knight
in the Mars Territory Army, taking command in emergencies. Her slender
figure, her beautiful face that gave a deceptively cool impression, and
her long, beautiful black hair makes her the object of admiration for
her male knight colleagues. And above all, Hisui is strong. As a user,
she wields earth magic, and her swordsmanship could likely rival even
the elite of the Royal Capital Knight Order. There have been several
marriage proposals, but she herself has absolutely no interest in
romance. Or rather, she's simply oblivious.  
  
"Miss Hisui. It's the cave halfway up that mountain. About another
5km."  
  
In a forested area near the border with the Baal Union, caravans had
been repeatedly attacked over the past few months.  
An investigation by the Asura Kingdom Intelligence Division revealed the
existence of a bandit group backed by a religious organization called
the "Order of Chaos". For this operation, Vice Commander Fuselnia from
the Royal Capital's Royal Guard was assigned as the overall commander,
with Hisui leading the Hisui Squad (10 members), alongside two other
10-member squads. For reference, Fuselnia is A-Rank, and the other squad
leaders are B-Rank.  
  
"I will rendezvous with Zilba Squad, who are monitoring the cave, to
share information. Marsim, come with me. Vice Squad Leader Mitsui,
please wait here with the other squad members."  
"Miss Hisui, please take me with you."  
"If you come along, who will take command if something happens? If
anything occurs, don't push yourselves. Retreat to Musashi Squad's
position."  
  
Smiling wryly at the displeased Mitsui, Hisui placed a hand on Marsim's
shoulder.  
  
"Marsim, please use Wind's Protection, just in case."  
"Leave it to me, Miss Hisui!"  
  
Marsim is 17 years old, C-Rank, and a female wind user. She’s highly
capable and, above all, deeply admires Hisui. And Hisui trusts her
junior who looks up to her.  
  
"Vice Squad Leader Mitsui, I'm counting on you."  
  
Hisui gave Mitsui a small wave and quietly headed towards the
mountainside.  
  
—-  
  
"Vice Squad Leader Mitsui is totally in love with you, Miss Hisui."  
  
Marsim said sulkily, pouting. Marsim's wind magic was active, ensuring
that only the two of them could hear the sounds they were making.  
  
"That's not true. He's just worried about his young squad leader."  
  
Mitsui is 25 years old, B-Rank. Although there had been friction when he
was first assigned to Hisui's squad, he's now a reliable
vice-commander.  
  
"But Vice Squad Leader Mitsui looks at you with lewd eyes, Miss
Hisui."  
  
Hisui was not interested in matters of romance between men and women.
Walking through the densely wooded mountain, Hisui's thoughts
wandered.  
  
(Swordsmanship and magic are just more interesting.)  
  
"Miss Hisui, you really should be more aware of how cute you are."  
  
Ignoring her junior's playful nonsense, Hisui contemplated the sword
techniques of her fellow knights.  
  
(Squad Leader Zilba uses textbook sword forms, so his moves are
predictable in individual combat. I could probably beat him without much
trouble. Vice-commander Fuselnia skillfully integrates swordsmanship and
water magic. Could I win against that...? But her magicule capacity as a
wielder is less than mine, so if I launch enough stones with magic, I
could probably win.)  
  
Suddenly, Hisui felt her skin crawl.  
  
(The presence of a monster? No!)  
  
"Marsim, can you pick up any sounds from the mountainside, near the
cave?"  
  
The cave was about 500m away. The rendezvous point with Zilba Squad was
on a cliff about 100m from there.  
  
"Yes, please wait. I'll dispel the silencing magic."  
  
Shortly after, the sounds of clashing blades and angry shouts reached
them.  
  
—  
  
"Squad Leader Zilba, there are too many! There's even an ogre!"  
  
There were 50 bandits. They had completely surrounded Zilba Squad. Among
them was an ogre. Ogres are typically a docile race. But judging from
the roars they heard, this one seemed anything but.  
  
"Ugaaaaah—"  
  
Along with a vicious roar, there was the sound of something being
crushed.  
  
"Using lightning!"  
  
A sharp crack echoed along with Zilba's voice.  
  
"!! Resistance?!"  
  
The lightning bolt unleashed by Zilba dissipated before reaching the
ogre. It was resisted by another user. Resisting magic is a considerably
advanced technique. It’s something only a B-Rank user or higher could
possibly manage.  
  
"There's a B-Rank or higher among them too? Form a breakthrough
formation! Three in the vanguard, three in the rearguard!"  
  
While giving orders to his squad members, Zilba intercepted an attacking
bandit with an upward slash from below, severing the bandit's arm. He
then channeled magicules into his longsword. Zilba is a light user.  
Five members of his squad were light users, two were wind, and one each
of earth, water, and fire. The four other light users channeled
magicules like Zilba, enhancing their swords. Their blades glowed
faintly. The wind user cast Wind's Protection over the squad, wary of
arrows.  
  
"Let's go!"  
  
—  
  
"Marsim, hurry back and regroup with Mitsui. Report the situation to
Vice-Commander Fuselnia and await orders."  
"What about you, Miss Hisui? Together..."  
  
The words suggesting they regroup with Vice Squad Leader Mitsui died in
her throat.  
  
"I'm joining Zilba Squad. A fast report is crucial! Hurry!"  
  
Struck by Hisui's unusually sharp tone, Marsim complied. Hisui's
intensity gave her goosebumps.  
  
"Understood. Miss Hisui, please don't push yourself."  
  
Marsim turned on her heel and started running.  
  
"Alright!"  
  
Hisui gathered five fist-sized stones from the ground around her and
imbued them with magicules. Imbued with magicules, the stones floated up
around Hisui.  
Confirming the spell's success, Hisui drew the rapier at her waist and
broke into a sprint.  
  
—  
  
Zilba trembled.  
  
(Strong. Why is a user like that with mere bandits?)  
  
Zilba ranked high among B-Rank knights. Because he adhered strictly to
fundamentals, his swordsmanship was without openings. He also had
experience. Yet such a man was now afraid of mere bandits.  
  
(And what is that sword? It's absorbing my magicules.)  
  
Is it being absorbed, or rather, devoured? The sword wielded by the
bandit swordsman was imbued with powerful magicules.  
  
(I can't identify the attribute of the magic sword.)  
  
It’s impossible. Zilba, a user, couldn't sense the magicule’s attribute.
Each time the swordsman swung the magic sword, Zilba's magicules were
devoured by it.  
  
"Squad Leader, get down!"  
  
The fire magic unleashed by Vice Squad Leader Tasmania exploded in front
of the swordsman.  
  
(!!)  
  
However, even the fire magicules that erupted into a blast wave were
devoured by the swordsman's magic sword.  
  
"Squad Leader Zilba, we need to withdraw."  
  
In the brief opening the swordsman presented, Tasmania pulled Zilba out
of the swordsman's range. And then…  
Tasmania unleashed a sharp slash at the swordsman. Even to Zilba, it
looked like a killing blow, but the swordsman effortlessly blocked the
attack with the magic sword. His display of power was overwhelming. The
last thing the astounded Tasmania saw was the strangely black blade of
the magic sword closing in on him.  
  
Zilba escaped the swordsman's reach and gathered his squad members. But
the club swung by the ogre crushed the head of yet another member.  
  
"How many are left?"  
"Five, sir."  
  
A nearby squad member replied curtly and then cleaved an attacking
goblin in two with his spear.  
  
(We can't break through unless we take down the ogre.)  
  
The swordsman behind them couldn't be beaten. They had to open a path
forward.  
Making his decision, Zilba channeled magicules into his sword again and
charged towards the ogre.  
  
"Hyaah!"  
  
The strike, delivered with all his might, was blocked by the ogre's
swinging club and never reached its target.  
  
"Ugh."  
  
The blade, into which Zilba had poured all his remaining magicules, was
shattered against the ogre's club.  
  
(It absorbed too many magicules.)  
  
A squad member providing cover was struck by an upward thrust of the
club and sent flying high into the air. Then, maintaining momentum, the
ogre swung the club down towards Zilba. A chill ran down Zilba's
spine.  
  
"!!"  
  
Suddenly, with a sickening \*thud\*, the ogre's head snapped back,
splattering blood that wet Zilba's cheeks red.  
  
"Squad Leader Zilba, I'll provide support!"  
  
Zilba felt as though he were watching a dream as the slender girl
slammed magicule-coated stones into the ogre's knee and head. She then
slammed another stone into the head of the now-collapsing ogre.  
  
"Squad Leader Zilba!"  
  
Hearing his name, Zilba snapped back to reality.  
  
"Miss Hisui."  
  
Hisui stepped in front of Zilba and readied her rapier.  
  
"Thank you for the support. We'll open a path behind the ogre."  
"Squad Leader Zilba, looks like I was a little too late."  
  
Hisui instantly understood why Zilba had intended to break through
behind the ogre. Her skin crawled. Hisui hurled the remaining two
magicule-coated stones at the charging swordsman. But the magicules were
devoured by the swordsman's magic sword, and they fell uselessly to the
ground.  
  
"I sense darkness. Are you worthy of being a shrine maiden?"  
  
The swordsman muttered and unleashed an overhead slash at Hisui. Leaping
backwards, Hisui felt her magicules being drained.  
  
(A sword clad in dark magicules. So sinister. It's completely different
from the particles of light and dark from back then.)  
  
Hisui recalled the scene she had witnessed three years ago on the Sugal
Plains. She felt the same power as the "dark particles" she saw then,
but those particles had been beautiful.  
  
"You understand this power?"  
"The power of darkness. A very sinister power."  
"I see."  
  
The swordsman gathered magicules in his left hand, created a ball of
fire, and launched it at Hisui.  
  
(A fire user?!)  
  
Hisui created an earth wall, about chest-high, and slid behind it.
Simultaneously, flames erupted, the heat searing Hisui's skin.  
  
"Miss Hisui!"  
  
Zilba gathered magicules in his left hand and thrust it towards the
swordsman. Light shot forth like an arrow towards the target, but this
too was devoured by the magic sword. Hisui gathered her magicules and
coated her rapier in iron. Clad in iron, the rapier became heavy and
elongated to about 3 meters, resembling an ogre's club.  
  
"Deyaaah!"  
  
With a fierce battle cry, Hisui slammed the rapier down on the
swordsman.  
  
(If it absorbs magicules, then I'll hit it with pure mass!)  
  
The stones Hisui threw had their magicules absorbed and fell to the
ground. The arrows of light, being close to a pure mass of magicules,
were also absorbed by the magic sword. Among users, only those of
'water' and 'earth' can transform magicules into pure physical matter.
Hisui intended to strike the magicule-absorbing magic sword with a mass
devoid of magicules.  
However, the swordsman struck the side of the rapier with his cursed
sword, deflecting its trajectory. His strength and swordsmanship were
unbelievable. Hisui immediately dispelled the iron mass from her rapier,
spun around, and moved closer to Zilba.  
  
"Squad Leader Zilba, I'm going to hit him with a massive amount of
magicules. When you see an opening, strike with your light arrows. He
shouldn't be able to devour two types of magicules simultaneously."  
  
"Miss Hisui, what are you..."  
"Here I go!"  
  
Ignoring Zilba, Hisui imbued the surrounding stones with magicules.
Twenty of them. Stones of various sizes began to orbit around Hisui.  
  
"Slightly surprising. But it's not pure darkness..."  
  
Hisui returned the swordsman's monologue with a cold smile, her mind on
the scene from the Sugal Plains.  
  
(Back then, the curse vanished after being unable to withstand the
interference between the particles of light and dark. That magic sword
feels like it has the same quality as the curse. In that case!)  
  
"Go!"  
  
The twenty stones, following Hisui's hand movements, assaulted the
swordsman. The attack was ferocious, but due to the cursed sword's
power, the stones were knocked to the ground one by one. But then,  
  
"How about this!"  
  
Hisui once again clad her rapier in iron, this time keeping it infused
with magicules, and slammed it against the cursed sword. The amount of
magicules Hisui struck with was enormous. It was as if she fueled it
with her own life force. The cursed sword took time to devour the
magicules.  
  
"Squad Leader Zilba, now!"  
  
At Hisui's signal, Zilba unleashed his arrow of light.  
  
"What!!"  
  
The arrow of light, instead of being devoured by the cursed sword,
pierced the swordsman's left shoulder.  
  
"Impressive. You know of the properties of darkness? Girl, state your
name."  
"Hisui."  
"I am Buenos. We shall meet again."  
  
Buenos gave a signal, and the bandits retreated. A few moments later,  
  
"Miss Hisui!"  
  
Hearing Marsim's voice and seeing the approaching figure of
Vice Commander Fuselnia, Hisui's consciousness faded into darkness.

Enter Hisui, a hardworking girl.
