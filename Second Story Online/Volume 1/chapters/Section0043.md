# 43・I'll Defeat You in 10 Seconds

The red beast started moving again, dragging its body. Following the
beast as it left the lake and headed into the forest, a glittering,
golden group, reflecting the light of the full moon, also began to
move.  
  
"What are you guys?!"  
"……I'm sorry, but we'll handle the red beast from here."  
  
We jumped in between the red beast and the golden group. The red beast
tried to escape behind us. Before us is a group of murderous
individuals. We're sandwiched between the two.  
  
"Light-san, you chase the red beast!"  
"B-but I can't do it alone…"  
  
Light-san looks perplexed by Kyle-san's words. I see, Kyle-san intends
to stall them.  
  
"Then go with Tsubaki-san. We'll hold them off here."  
  
I stood beside Kyle-san. It's better to have two people holding them off
than one. Besides, it conveniently splits us into two groups.  
  
"……Understood."  
"Eh, wait a minute!"  
  
Tsubaki-san forcibly carried the flustered Light-san away on her
shoulder. I don't know where she gets that strength, but she swiftly
chased after the red beast.  
  
Now then… leaving the red beast to the other two, let's do our job. I
glared at them, deterring them from following the red beast and the
other two.  
  
"You bastards, are you trying to steal our prey?"  
"The red beast was a person corrupted by Chaos. Defeating it without the
power of a hero is no good!"  
"Who cares about that!"  
  
The other members raised their voices in agreement with the leader-like
man. Despite this, Kyle-san didn't stop.  
  
"A life is at stake! Understand?!"  
"What life? It's just an NPC who will die anyway. Get out of the way!
Stop getting in our way!"  
  
NPCs… you're right. But we can't back down. We are role-players. We have
to act as people who live in this world. If Chloe doesn't want them to
pass through here, it's my job to make it so.  
Besides, I also want to help Lucille-san. Even if it means taking
something from others. Even if this is considered annoying game
etiquette.  
  
"It's not right to disregard human life."  
"A game NPC doesn't have a life, for crying out loud."  
  
The lives of NPCs are probably that cheap, but we can't think that
way.  
This is just a game. It's because it's a game that we are playing like
this. It's because we're playing as the characters, because we're
playing seriously, that we can't let this slide.  
  
We're just serious about the game in a different way than you guys.  
  
"It seems talks are impossible…"  
"We're not talking with the likes of you. If you're going to get in the
way, we'll crush you, that's all."  
  
The leader laughed. Eight against two. They're probably thinking they
can quickly deal with us and then chase the red beast. That's why
they're not following Light-san and the others.  
  
"I don't want to fight, but it can't be helped."  
*'……Do you have any plans?'*  
  
With a grim expression on his face, Kyle-san readied his sword and
shield, and then his voice sounded twice. No, it's not exactly twice;
he's sending individual chat messages while role-playing, so it just
sounds that way.  
  
"Don't think you can win with this difference in numbers!"  
"Oh, is that so?"  
*'There's no way we can!'*  
  
I replied with a relaxed smile to their taunts. And I expressed my true
feelings in private chat. I never thought we'd be able to hold off eight
people with just two of us! Maybe it would have been better if
Tsubaki-san had stayed behind after all.  
  
"If you want to chase the red beast, defeat us first!"  
"That's right! We won't let you go to Light-san's location. We
absolutely won't let you pass here!"  
  
We resolutely decided together. Isn't this the coolest scene ever?!  
But…  
  
*'Ten seconds! Just ten seconds! Hold off eight people by yourself!'*  
*'What?! Don't ask for the impossible! I can only do five seconds at
most!!'*  
*'Then die trying to stretch it out by another five seconds! Alright,
ten! Nine!!'*  
*'You're already starting the incantation! It's impossible, you
idiot!'*  
  
They wouldn't think we're having this exchange in private chat. But…
this is our only chance to win. …We have to catch them off guard. A
prolonged battle against eight is impossible; we'll go for a super
short-term decisive battle.  
  
So, please protect me for ten seconds, Kyle-san.  
  
The enemy moved as I began my magic incantation. The eight-person party
was divided into four front-line and four back-line members.  
  
The front line group had a man who seemed to be the leader wielding a
one-handed sword. The others had a great sword and a spear. There was
also one shield-wielder, just like Kyle-san. The rear line group had two
people who seemed to be healers. One magic user. One bow user.  
  
――Eight seconds left.  
  
The front-line approached Kyle-san. Kyle-san charged into the middle of
them, using a shield bash on the shield-bearer. He forced his way into
their midst. It seems that he used a taunt skill there. Because of this,
the four front-line members can only attack Kyle-san.  
  
――Seven seconds left.  
  
The problem is the back-line. They're not affected by Kyle-san's taunt,
so they can attack freely. While the mage is chanting, the archer took a
shot at me. I anticipated this, so while chanting, I activated \[Wind
Shield\] with a double cast to defend myself.  
Before a more powerful attack could come, Niru cast \[Dark Mist\]. It‘ll
probably be dispelled because of the healer, but it'll still buy us a
few seconds. Niru, please continue hindering them.  
  
――Six seconds left.  
  
Kyle-san was fighting four people in the center. He deftly handled his
large shield to block an enemy attack, then quickly stepped back to
avoid another. He dodged powerful attacks, and even sometimes received
them, but he still found space to retaliate.  
  
Was Kyle-san always this strong? No, his player skill has improved since
the last time we were in a party together. It was only a few seconds of
combat, but that was enough to tell the difference.  
  
Even so, he's still up against four people. His health is getting low,
so I took out a healing potion and threw it. I was able to prepare it
because I could quickly get it out of my bag.  
  
――Five seconds left.  
  
"Who said you could pass?!"  
"You're just trying to act tough!"  
  
Kyle-san's body was glowing blue. Checking the log, I saw that the skill
name is \[Brave Armor\]. It seems the skill is reducing damage,
drastically decreasing the damage he takes. I see, that's how he can
manage five seconds.  
  
Unconcerned about damage, Kyle-san continued holding off the four
front-line members without restraint. He can't defeat them, but because
of the taunt skill's effect, they can't attack me or advance unless they
defeat him. For this moment, Kyle-san has become an insurmountable wall
for them.  
  
However, only the front-line is affected by the taunt skill.  
  
――Four seconds left.  
  
The back-line recovered. Immediately after, they attacked me.  
I use \[Earth Shield\] to defend against the archer and mage's attacks.
It broke quickly, but I'm unharmed.  
  
――Three seconds left.  
  
"Give up! No matter how hard you try, you can't win against us!"  
  
The front-line members recovered health from the support from the
back-line. They weren't that hurt to begin with, but they probably
wanted to show us that we couldn't win.  
  
But that's not necessarily true. I took out the \[Dark Soup\] I made the
other day. I gulped it down in one go. My eyes watered from the
overpowering stench, but I managed to swallow it all.  
My hands trembled, and I dropped the container, spilling the remaining
soup on the ground. Ignoring it, I concentrated my strength on my staff
so my incantation wouldn't fail.  
  
――Two seconds left.  
  
The edge of my vision warped. Below my rapidly decreasing health gauge
is a row of ten status effect icons. Three of them I have resistance to,
so the effect is weak, but even excluding those, seven status effects
have been applied.  
  
"Chloe!"  
  
Kyle-san stared at me with a shocked expression. It's alright, this is
something I did. I haven't died yet—  
  
"I don't know what you're chanting, but it's over!"  
"――!?"  
  
A light exploded behind us, and then flew towards me. The light is
lightning. Just from its appearance, it's clear it's a high-power magic
spell. If I take this, I'll die.  
  
――One second left.  
  
I involuntarily closed my eyes from the blinding bluish-white light.
Immediately after, the explosion from the spell rang out.  
  
"Chloe!!"  
  
Kyle-san's voice could be heard from far away. A more desperate voice
than before.  
  
"It seems that guy's dead. Now it's just you!"  
  
The leader laughed, convinced of his victory. The bluish light
protecting Kyle-san faded, as the effect wore off. His health was
already low. There's nothing Kyle-san can do about it.  
  
Well, that's only if I were dead.  
  
"What is this?!"  
  
A purple magic circle appeared at the feet of the golden group. It's
fortunate that everyone was within range at this distance. Also, I used
magic relying on Niru's vision. It was easier since it was from above.  
  
"Be consumed by darkness and vanish! Dark Burst!"  
  
I completed the ten-second incantation and unleashed \[Dark Burst\]. An
explosion of darkness engulfed the golden individuals. Glittering in the
darkness were the golden figures themselves, and perhaps broken golden
armor.  
  
"Kukukuku…Ahahahahahaha! Experience the full extent of my power of
darkness!"  
  
In Niru's vision, there's a figure of a black witch laughing maniacally
from a tree, clutching to it to keep from being blown away by the wind.
It's me, of course.  
I'm here because I dodged the lightning earlier with \[Shadow Move\].
And that's why I ended up on top of this tree.  
  
"N-no way…"  
  
The explosion on the ground subsided. The ground was gouged out,
showcasing the power of the explosion, and eight people are lying on the
ground. Probably all of them are out of health. There was no sign of
movement at all.  
  
That's to be expected. The \[Dark Burst\] this time was on a completely
different level.  
The power increases when used at night, a characteristic of dark magic.
The power also increases from skills such as \[Moonlight\],
\[Rebellion\], and \[Dark Wisdom\].  
  
Furthermore, the effect of \[Dark Compensation\] is also active. Attack
and magic attack power increase while under status ailments. The more
status ailments, the more damage.  
  
This time, I had ten status ailments from the \[Dark Soup\]. In reality,
it was seven, but it seems seven was more than enough. Even with some
status effects lowering my stats, it was powerful enough to cancel out
the debuffs.  
  
Heh heh heh… I unleashed a terrifying spell!  
  
"Ahahahahahaha, Ha, Cough cough!"  
  
Ah! I was just about to end my triumphant laugh when I started coughing!
Ugh, the taste of the soup is coming back …I can't stop coughing, it
hurts, and I feel sick…  
  
My vision has been spinning for a while now, so the feeling of nausea is
only getting worse. And the colors are blurry, and gradually turning
gray… gray? Gray?!  
  
"Gah…I… forgot…"  
  
That's right. The status effects from the \[Dark Soup\]. There was one
that dealt continuous damage… Because of that, I died in a few
seconds.
