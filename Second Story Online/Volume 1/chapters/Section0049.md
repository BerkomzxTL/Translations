# 49・Magician Lucille

“My body, corrupted by Chaos, was purified by the Hero, Light's power.
But even so, it seems my body has been eroded by Chaos.”  
  
Lucille-san's expression, bathed in the setting sun, was a smile, but
she also looked like she was in some kind of indescribable pain.  
  
"Even after purification, a body eroded and destroyed will not return to
its original state. My body was already weak due to age, so this outcome
was expected. Therefore, I don't have much time left. For now, I'm only
managing to hold on thanks to my power as a Guardian."  
"...Is that true? I guess since you're saying it..."  
  
This person wouldn't lie. Therefore, what she says must be true. I now
understand the meaning of Niru's gaze towards her from before.  
  
"I finally understand. Why you didn't tell us you were the Red Beast at
first."  
"I told you, unnecessary and cruel truths are best left unknown."  
  
She knew from the beginning. That even after proper purification by the
hero's power, her fate of death wouldn't change.  
  
"And to avoid being entangled in troublesome matters."  
"...That is..."  
"Wouldn't you understand if you listened to my story?"  
  
The forest guardian, standing in the setting sun, smiled gently. Yes, I
understand.  
  
The secret hidden in this forest. Someone who shouldn't know it knows
this forest's secret.  
  
Even in this situation, the guardian of the seal in this forest is about
to be absent. Having heard her explanation, I understand. That's why she
told me her secret.  
  
"Lucille-san, it seems you want me to take over as guardian."  
"Want isn't the word. You will succeed me. That's why I told you the
secret hidden in this forest."  
"...You're really something."  
  
When you hear a story like this, there's only one choice to make.
Moreover, I can't leave this forest. Even my escape route is blocked.  
  
"What if I refuse?"  
"...Please don't make me get my hands dirty."  
  
She doesn't want to let me go after learning her secret.
...Realistically, even if Chloe really died here, I wouldn't die, so the
information itself would live on. Well, let's put that aside for now.  
  
"You're threatening me despite seemingly not having much time left?"  
"I only need to find a replacement before I die. Besides, I've already
got my eye on someone who might replace you. Kyle, for instance."  
"Isn't Kyle-san too kind-hearted?"  
"...That's the biggest problem. Therefore, it'd be good if you just
nodded."  
  
Agreeing here would make things smoother, but I don't want to. Because,
like this, Chloe wouldn't nod. And I can't nod either.  
  
"Are you really that reluctant to become the guardian? I thought you
would agree."  
"...I didn't say I didn't want to become the guardian."  
  
Chloe ran away from home seeking freedom. She has some thoughts, but
ultimately she hated being a noble, so maybe being a guardian would be
okay.  
  
And, in any case, I think I can't ignore this situation. Lucille-san has
figured this out as well.  
It's true that Chloe isn't as pure and straightforward as Kyle-san, but
she does what she believes is right, even if it's twisted... I think.  
  
"I said I would get involved. Until I'm satisfied."  
"Then why don't you want to become the guardian?"  
  
If I accept, I'll become the guardian. In that case, the guardian's
power will be transferred to me. If Lucille-san loses her power as the
guardian, she will surely die.  
  
What should I do? Is there anything I can do?  
  
My eyes fell on the black cat at Lucille-san's feet. The familiar black
cat was looking at her with a worried expression. ...Ah, I see, that's
an option.  
  
"I've decided. I'll become the guardian."  
"You finally agreed."  
"But I have one condition."  
"A condition...?"  
"Will you become my familiar, Lucille-san?"  
  
It should be possible according to the system. Human contracts aren't
forbidden, and I have one slot left for a familiar contract.  
  
"Oh, you want me as your familiar?"  
"I don't think it's a bad deal for you... You still don't want to die,
do you? That's why you asked us to find a hero."  
  
She knew from the beginning that she would die, so why did she seek the
hero's power? Perhaps she saw a glimmer of hope that she might be saved
by its purifying power.  
  
"...I think I've lived enough, but I'm human, too. I still don't want to
die. I knew that if I became a familiar, I wouldn't die. But I didn't
want to live that much. That's why I didn't say anything, but... Are you
alright with that?"  
"Whether it's alright or not, you're a far superior magician than me. I
just don't want to lose you to something like Chaos."  
"I understand your intentions now. You want my knowledge as a magician,
don't you? You should have just been honest and said you wanted to be my
disciple..."  
  
Did you notice? It's definitely not just a desire to help.  
  
Lucille-san is a magician I respect. It's no wonder Chloe wants her
knowledge, since she's probably learned magic on her own up until now.  
  
"Kakaka. Well, it seems like it would be good for me to become your
familiar. And if I become your familiar, you'll succeed me as the
guardian, right?"  
"Yes, of course."  
"Mmm, then let's do it right away. First, I'll transfer the authority of
the guardian to you."  
  
Lucille-san extended a hand towards me. A faint star-shaped mark
appeared on the back of her hand. Simultaneously, a magic circle
appeared at her feet, shining brightly. Reacting to the light, the
golden lake also began to glow.  
  
"I, the Guardian of the Seal, hereby transfer my duty to the next
guardian."  
  
《Do you accept the inheritance of the Guardian of the Seal from
Lucille?》  
  
In response to Lucille-san, a magic circle appeared at my feet. A system
window appeared in my vision.  
  
"I accept the duty of the next guardian."  
  
Those words served as authentication. The cursor on the window pressed
YES.  
  
《Inheriting the Guardian of the Seal from Lucille. You have become the
new \[Guardian of the Seal\].》  
  
The magic circles at Lucille-san's and my feet disappeared. The lake
also returned to normal. The mark on Lucille-san's hand disappeared, and
the same mark appeared on my hand. It seems to be a mark representing
the guardian. Checking my information, it seems the inheritance was
successful.  
  
"New Guardian Chloe, fulfill your duty diligently."  
  
Lucille-san smiled, but then collapsed to her knees. I rushed to her
side, lifting her up. She was contorting her face in pain. The nearby
black cat meowed worriedly.  
  
"It seems we don't have much time. Let's make the contract right
away."  
  
This time, I chanted a spell. Targeting Lucille-san in front of me, I
used the familiar \[Contract\] skill.  
  
"To think that I would end up making a contract as a familiar..."  
  
Her expression softened, and she laughed merrily. Her figure was
enveloped in light and disappeared. Looking at my familiar list, the
name \[Magician Lucille\] had been added. It seems the contract was
successful.  
  
"It's okay. I'll summon her immediately."  
  
I smiled at Earl, who was looking worriedly at the disappeared
Lucille-san. I raised my staff and summoned her.  
  
"Now, come forth, Lucille-san!"  
  
A magic circle appeared, and the light gradually took on a human form.
When the light settled, Lucille-san appeared.  
  
"Kakaka. Magician Lucille, answering the summoning. Hmm, it seems the
contract was successfully completed. I see, this is what it's like to be
a familiar..."  
  
Lucille-san began to look at herself with a slightly excited look.
Seeing that, I felt relieved.  
  
"Yes, truly good—eh!?"  
  
My relief was short-lived. Lucille-san's form began to glow again. Then
the humanoid form turned into a sphere of light.  
  
*‘Ah, as I thought…'*  
"What... what's happening?"  
*‘Hmm, perhaps your power is insufficient. The contracted familiar is a
being close to a half-spirit. It is you, the contractor, who gives a
physical form to the normally soul-only familiar. I know I shouldn't
brag, but I was a higher-ranking magician than you are now. Therefore,
my soul rank is probably higher than yours. Creating a suitable body for
me is impossible for a half-baked magician like you.'*  
  
Lucille-san's voice echoed in my ears. It seems that only I can hear
this voice.  
  
But even so, does that mean I'm not at a high enough level to properly
summon Lucille-san, who was a higher-ranking magician than me...?
Because I'm not at a high enough level, it seems I can only turn her
into a spirit.  
  
*‘Hmm, this form is inconvenient... I'll borrow your body for a
while.'*  
  
Lucille-san's soul approached the black cat and entered its body.  
  
*‘Yes, it seems I can borrow the body of an animal.'*  
  
The voice was still only audible to me. Lucille-san, possessing the
black cat, moved her body as if testing its movement.  
  
"I'll be able to summon you properly someday."  
*'Yes, I'll help you with that. I'm looking forward to working with you
from now on, Chloe.'*  
"Yes, please take care of me."  
  
I shook hands with Lucille-san, the black cat. I never thought you would
become my familiar in such a way.
