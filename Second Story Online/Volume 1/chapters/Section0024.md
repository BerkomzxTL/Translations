# 24・Nice To Meet You, Bandit-san

“……Found us. Oh well.”  
  
A group of three emerged from the bushes: a beast girl with cat ears, a
young elf with a bow, and a chubby dwarf with a staff. All were dressed
in practical clothing, like bandits… that's what they seemed to be.  
  
“To meet people in a place like this… if only I had potions to sell.”  
“Don't worry, potion seller. We're not after potions.”  
  
A young man with long, delicate ears, typical of an elf. Contrary to his
appearance, he spoke in a casual tone. My presence as a potion seller in
this forest was known among the veteran players; many would approach me
hoping to buy. But this time seemed different.  
  
“Then what is your purpose?”  
“Well, of course… uh, what was our purpose again?”  
  
The girl, who had started to speak confidently, looked troubled and
turned around midway.  
  
“Hey, what are you doing? Just do it the same as always."  
“Yeah, I think so too. The usual way.”  
“Oh, really? Then, ahem… uh, we… uh, want your money! That's all!”  
  
The other two looked exasperated at her stammering declaration. The
young elf even placed a hand on his forehead.  
  
“I wonder if she'll ever get this right?”  
“S-shut up! I'm not used to it yet, so it can't be helped!"  
“Used to it? How many times have you done this already?”  
“Both of you, calm down. Don't argue here.”  
  
The two bickered while the dwarf tried to pacify them. Once they calmed
down, they turned back to me.  
  
“So, that's it. I don't need to go into detail, you know that. We're
bandits, and you're the prey. Hand over your money if you value your
life.”  
  
Well, that's easy to understand. I thought that was probably the case
from the beginning, but when I hear it directly like this, I think, "Oh,
I guess that's what it is." It's necessary to check the facts. They
could have just been asking for directions.  
  
“Exactly! Well said, my humble servant!”  
"...Why are you able to do that so well?"  
“It works better when I don't consciously try.”  
“That means you're unconsciously treating me like your servant!”  
  
The elf groaned in response to the dwarf's comment.  
  
“Fu, fuhaha! So, uh… yeah, leave your money and we'll spare your life!
Uh… what should I say next… now, what will you do? Give us your money?
Or your life? Uh… either one is fine, just leave it behind! Please!”  
  
Why is a bandit begging? I'm not giving them anything. The elf is
facepalming again. I kind of understand how he feels.  
  
Well then… if this keeps up, the elf's headache won't go away, so I'll
give you my answer.  
  
“I won't be giving you any money.”  
"...So you don't value your life?"  
  
The dwarf asks. The elf is talking to the cat-eared girl. Their mouths
are moving, but I can't hear them, so they must be using party chat.  
  
“No way…”  
  
A three-on-one fight would be overwhelmingly disadvantageous. It's dusk
now, making the situation even worse. Even at night, the numbers
wouldn't be in my favor. But I can't just hand over my money. I don't
want to die either.  
  
I should run away. While fighting is impossible, escaping might still be
an option. I know this forest well. Even if I can't escape, I'm on the
western edge now; if I get to the south, where there are more players, I
can ask for help.  
  
“I'd appreciate it if you would step aside.”  
  
To do so, I have to pass through them. Niru, who was waiting above, cast
\[Dark Mist\] on them at my command. While their vision is obscured,
I'll slip past them and run south.  
  
“Seriously?”  
“……！？”  
  
I heard the sound of wind cutting through the air. I instinctively
dodged to the side. An arrow passed through the spot where I had been
standing.  
  
Looking back in surprise, I see the elf with his bow drawn. That's odd,
they should have been blinded by Niru's \[Dark Mist\]. The effect should
still be ongoing.  
  
Yet, all three are looking directly at me. And some skill effect is
sparkling around them.  
  
The answer is obvious. The dwarf youth. He was holding a staff. I
initially mistook him for a magic user like myself, but… apparently he's
a cleric who uses healing magic.  
  
“To challenge three people to a fight… honestly, I'm surprised.”  
“Well, this kind of thing happens a lot, you know.”  
  
Huh? I don't remember declaring war. I only asked them to move... Was
that how it was interpreted?  
  
“Why won't you give us the money!?”  
“That's just you, Azi. Get ready to fight.”  
“Huh?”  
“Azi(…!)”  
“Oh, right! That's right! Sorry, Yu… no, Saval!”  
“You…!!”  
  
After that, they switched chat channels or something, and I couldn't
hear them anymore. I can guess what they're talking about, though. They
have their work cut out for them.  
  
“…It must be quite a misfortune for you to be attacked by the likes of
us.”  
“Indeed, it is.”  
“Honestly. However, since you intend to fight back, we'll go
three-on-one even if we're called cowardly, so be prepared.”  
  
So I… fine. But three-on-one is really cowardly. I'd better prepare
myself to be defeated.  
  
Fufu, I'm already prepared for that. Is it not you who should be
preparing?”  
  
Chloe is bluffing… or maybe fleeing wasn't something that suited her.
Turning her back to run wouldn't be her style. Sigh… oh well, even if
it's a losing battle, I'll fight back.  
  
Now that I've decided, I hope night will come quickly.
