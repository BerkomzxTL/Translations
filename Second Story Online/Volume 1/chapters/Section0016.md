# 16・The Knight Was Actually An Old Man

“Oh, so you two will take care of the goblins?”  
“Yes, of course. Leave the peace of this village to us.”  
  
Kyle-san answered the village chief clearly. His dignified attitude
truly befits a righteous knight. And despite the late hour, the village
chief warmly welcomed us. Is it because he's an NPC?  
  
"Well then, I'll leave it to you."  
  
《Quest: Goblin Extermination in Berry Village: For the safety of Berry
Village, defeat thirty goblins.》  
  
I confirmed acceptance of the quest. Thirty goblins? I thought it might
be a bit difficult alone, but with Kyle-san, it should be a breeze.  
  
“…By the way, Village Chief. I have a question.”  
  
Oh? Kyle-san spoke to the village chief. We accepted the quest, but is
there something else he wanted to ask?  
  
“I heard there's a very beautiful woman in this village. Do you know
her?”  
  
Kyle-san likes women, huh. Well, judging from how he treated me, I had a
feeling. That's probably his character setting.  
  
Even so, the village chief's complexion is darkening. What's wrong?  
  
“…My daughter was the most beautiful woman in this village.”  
“…Was?”  
“She passed away, my daughter.”  
  
The village chief moved towards the window. There was a picture frame
there. A sepia-toned photo showed the village chief and a young, lovely
woman who looked like his daughter standing side-by-side.  
  
“It'll be about a month soon… This village was attacked by a large
number of goblins some time ago. …At that time, there were people who
protected the village, and the village was safe… but my daughter…”  
  
The village chief didn't speak any further.  
  
“I'm so sorry for asking such a trivial thing…”  
“Don't apologize. It's all in the past.”  
  
The village chief spoke kindly to Kyle-san, who was bowing his head. But
he still seems a little listless.  
  
“Well… this is a separate matter, but could you do one more thing for
me?”  
  
This time, the village chief stopped us. What on earth was going on?  
  
“What's this other matter?”  
“Well, I'm actually looking for ingredients for a medicine. They seem to
be available in the nearby forest, but orcs, who are stronger than
goblins, live there. I can't go look for it myself. So, could you look
for it for me?"  
  
Medicine ingredients? I'm a little interested.  
  
“…I don't know much about plants, but…”  
“I have some knowledge. So please leave it to me.”  
“Oh, that's reliable. Then I'll leave it to you.”  
  
《Quest: Searching for Medicine Ingredients: Search for medicine
ingredients near Berry Village.》  
  
Let's accept this one as well.  
  
…Niru, what's wrong? Niru seemed a little off. He was staring intently
at the village chief for a while, but then he closed his eyes and went
back to sleep as if nothing had happened.  
  
…However, now that I think about it, I don't know of any quests like
this. I was sure there were no other quests here besides the goblin
extermination request…  
  
“Chloe-san, could I talk to you for a moment?”  
  
Apparently, Kyle-san was also wondering. He spoke to me after we left
the village chief's house.  
  
“…What kind of medicine ingredients do you think they are?”  
“I don't know. I was told about the plant, but I have no idea what it's
used for.”  
  
The quest information clearly shows a picture of the plant the village
chief requested. However, because my appraisal skills are still lacking,
I don't know what kind of plant it is.  
  
“I'm sorry, I wish I knew more about plants…”  
“No, don't worry about it. …By the way…”  
“What is it, Kyle-san?”  
  
Kyle-san has a very troubled expression. He seems to be trying to say
something difficult.  
  
“…Ah, this is bothersome. Can I just say something as a player?"  
“…Please do.”  
  
For a moment, I wondered how to respond to that. No, it's a small thing,
but I wondered if it would be better for me to continue role-playing. If
I had continued, I probably would have feigned ignorance like an NPC and
said, “What's that?” Serious role-players continue their role-playing in
any situation, but I'm not like that, so I guess it's no problem.  
  
“Sorry. Chloe-san, do you know about epic quests?”  
  
Kyle-san's way of speaking is quite different from just now. The outward
appearance doesn't match his slightly older-man-like way of speaking. I
see, his inner self seems a little different… Well, I can't say anything
about others.  
  
Now then, epic quests… There was a little information about it on the
strategy site.  
  
“A special quest different from normal quests… was it?”  
“Yeah, that's right, a rare epic quest is one with few reports. …By the
way, your way of speaking hasn't changed.”  
“Yes, well…”  
  
This is a drawback of having done role-playing as myself from the start.
Also, because of my language skills, I half-forgot the role-playing.
…Well, I think this way of speaking suits Chloe, who was a viscount's
daughter, so I'll leave it as it is.  
  
"The village chief just said that this village was attacked by
goblins... I think he was referring to the epic quest that happened here
a while ago."  
  
Kyle-san shows me his screen. It was the official homepage. It's the
official history section. The history of various events around the world
is recorded, and some of the stories could be played back as VR
videos.  
  
“I didn't know this existed…”  
“Haven't you looked at the official site? I mean, I thought that there
would be no role-player who didn't know about it..."  
“I only gave the official site a once-over… I mostly look at strategy
sites.”  
  
Game strategy information is more comprehensive on strategy sites than
on the official site. They always announce maintenance information
in-game as well. ...Well, I didn't look at it much.  
  
"I'm surprised you decided to play this game as a role-player... but,
well, this history is in a hard-to-see spot, so it can't be helped."  
  
Then Kyle-san told me that if I'm going to role-play, I should at least
look at the history of the world setting. …Well, is that necessary to
become a witch? Even if you're not hardcore, you should look at it, he
said. Thanks for the advice.  
  
"So, I was looking through this history earlier, and I came across
something I didn't expect. It was an epic quest at the time."  
  
《History \#10: Duo Region: Berry Village: Goblin Invasion》  
  
Yes, there it was. And it came with a video. Since it was rather long,
to summarize, a four-person party received the same goblin extermination
quest as us.  
  
They receive an explanation from the village chief that the number of
goblins has increased recently because fewer people were willing to hunt
them down. Then, when they went out to the field, Berry Village was
already surrounded by what must have been a hundred goblins…  
  
“…That party walked into a disaster back then. To casually come to
defeat goblins and then have to defend the village…”  
“That's how epic quests are. You never know when or where they'll
happen. And the biggest feature is—”  
  
—It's a quest that will have an impact on this world.  
  
The four-person party was entrusted with the defense of the village.
They somehow succeeded in defending the village despite their
inexperience… However, there were a few casualties. The video confirms
that the village chief's daughter was among the victims.  
  
“NPCs generally don't die. This is a game after all. But this game is a
little different. When an epic quest is involved, that concept breaks
down. There are rumors that even player characters can die (be lost).
But it's still just a rumor.”  
  
If this were an ordinary game, the world would have remained unchanged.
No, if that game had a “story,” it might have changed a little. But
that's a change that's already decided. It's simply something the admins
would have created.  
  
SSO is a little different. The change is left to the players… is that
it? If the four-person party had perfectly defended the village back
then, the village chief's daughter would still be alive and would have
welcomed us. Conversely, the village could have been destroyed and
disappeared from the map.  
  
“So, in short…”  
“This is a continuation of that epic quest…?”  
  
The four couldn't protect the village and save the village chief's
daughter… that epic quest is still continuing, is that it?  
  
“It's just a possibility. The quest that came out was different from the
information provided. Well, it's probably a good idea to be careful.”  
  
An epic quest that might start at any time, or might already be
underway. If such a request comes from the village chief, who was
involved, it's fair to assume that this is probably the case.  
  
“But seriously, what the heck. I was lured in by a cute girl, only to
find out she's dead… and it feels like I've been dragged into taking on
an epic quest…. Anyway, those four, you'd better watch over this girl
for the rest of your life, especially you, knight..”  
  
Kyle-san glared at the knight with intense eyes. Ah, what a waste of a
pretty face.  
  
Niru, don't puff out your chest with that smug look. It's common for the
player's inner self not to match their outer appearance. I understood
from the beginning, so don't worry.  
  
“Let's wrap this up for now. Shall we go goblin hunting. Chloe-san?”  
  
Where did that feeling from just now go? There is a beautiful Kyle-san
blowing through with a refreshing breeze.  
  
“…Yes, let's do that.”  
  
Let's switch gears and respond appropriately. I didn't see that Kyle-san
earlier. Okay?
