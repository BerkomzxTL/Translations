# 5・Beware of Scams

It's early in the morning, but the townsfolk are already awake. That's
only natural since, for the player, it's not actually morning. NPCs are
also open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Some NPCs even have set
hours.  
  
When I arrived in Dairode Town, I immediately started looking for a
place that sells food. I had left this town quickly and didn't explore.
So I thought I'd check the map to see where everything was, but... I
found the place without checking the map. Thank you, local knowledge
skill.  
  
“Oh…”  
  
The market I arrived at was quite crowded. Stalls lined the area.
Vendors selling things to people passing by. A beginner-like player was
looking at the weapons lined up and thinking about what to get for his
next equipment.  
  
Walking through the area, I searched for a food stall.  
  
“This smell…”  
  
I caught a fragrant aroma coming from somewhere. Drawn in, I wandered
towards it and found a stall selling grilled meat skewers.  
  
“One, please.”  
  
The words slipped out unconsciously. Even though I'd had a full lunch in
reality, not eating this would be a waste!  
  
“……○○○○○?”  
  
The stall owner's expression is one of utter surprise… Right, I can't
speak the local language. Though, judging by his surprise, there seems
to be more to it than just that.  
  
I had no choice but to use gestures to communicate, and the man seemed
to get it, as he started using gestures to communicate with me as
well.  
  
Then the store's trade screen was displayed. Ah, so this is how shopping
works.  
30G per skewer. I input the quantity, the money is deducted, and a meat
skewer is added to my inventory.  
Hmm? On closer inspection, there are two skewers. That's strange; I only
ordered one.  
I glanced at the owner. Seeing my puzzled expression, he winks. Ah, a
freebie!  
  
“Thank you!”  
  
I thanked him with a smile. Even though he probably doesn't understand
the words, my feelings seem to have gotten across, as he returned the
smile.  
  
After that, I left the market, found a place to sit, and started on my
lunch. The pork-like taste filled my mouth and the gravy was amazing
too.  
  
Ah, I don't usually eat such fatty meat. It's so delicious, it's been
ages! I should have started playing VR games sooner.  
  
By the time I finish the two skewers, my hunger is gone.  
  
…Now, let's think about the future.  
  
Food is a necessity, but to regularly buy it, I need to find a way to
earn money. Currently, I can't accept quests. I can't speak the
language. It’s frustrating that the language skill won't appear in the
obtainable list until certain conditions are met. Should I just talk to
the residents a lot?  
  
Then, should I sell things? The monster pelts and wings I got from my
hunt. I don't have much, but I'm sure I can get at least some money.  
  
My current funds are 2970G. Normally, the standard starting money is
1000G. That's low for a noble… so it's probably an effect of my
background. I'm fine for now, but money is a consumable resource. Let’s
try selling some items.  
  
Thinking this, I returned to the market. …What is this? Every step I
take, I feel the piercing gazes of the shopkeepers. It happened a few
times earlier, but it wasn't this noticeable.  
  
“△△△△!”  
  
Suddenly, someone stands in front of me. They have something in their
hand. It looks like a basic potion, but the color is a bit off.  
  
“△△△”  
  
They thrust it at me and hold up four fingers.  
Ah, a pushy salesman. I see. He must have witnessed my earlier
transaction. He probably thinks I'm easy prey. Now the constant stares
from the shopkeepers make sense. My noble-looking clothes are probably a
factor. They assume a noble would be a big spender…  
  
I tentatively pushed back the potion he handed me and shook my head,
saying I didn't need it.  
This time I'm not here to buy, I'm here to sell.  
  
Under the scrutinizing eyes of everyone, I finally reached a suitable
shop. I called out to the owner and started taking out the items for
sale. Even though we didn’t speak the same language, the owner
understood and counted up the items, displaying the price on the trade
window.  
  
Gray Rabbit Leader’s Horn: 150G  
Gray Rabbit Pelt x4: 100G  
Night Bat Wing x2: 100G  
Night Bat Fang x2: 100G  
  
Total: 450G  
  
…Having come this far, I have no idea about the market prices. I should
have researched beforehand. Is this a good price or am I being ripped
off? The skewers were 30G each. Was I overcharged? Or maybe the skewer
vendor was undercharging? I have no idea…  
  
The shopkeeper tapped the counter repeatedly, as if urging me to hurry.
…With a sigh, I accepted the trade. I received 450G.  
As I left the store and walked down the street, I bumped into the same
man from the food stall again. He had a very strange look on his face.  
  
――Well, afterwards I gathered information from bulletin boards and such.
It seems that I was duped into selling at a low price after all. Sorry
for doubting you, skewer vendor. You were right. By the way, a Gray
Rabbit Leader’s Horn is worth 250G. I'm never going back to that shop.  
  
After that, I managed to get directions to a clothing store from the
skewer vendor using gestures. My intuition told me to ask him, and yes,
it was a good clothing store. I bought a black hooded cloak for 300G.
Why did I buy this? Because my current outfit seems troublesome in many
ways, so this helps to disguise me. My current equipment is good, so I
can't change it.  
  
And a cloak makes me look witchy, doesn't it? That's one of the reasons,
I suppose. I'd like to buy a pointed hat someday.  
Oh, I also bought more grilled meat skewers from the vendor. I now have
ten skewers; he gave me five extra. These are emergency rations, so I'll
put them in my inventory. …But my earnings from today have
disappeared.
