# 44・No Need to Thank Me

My limp body collapsed onto the ground. Since I'm already a corpse, I
don't have to worry about fall damage. Or rather, I shouldn't. Falling
headfirst is pretty scary.  
  
"Chloe! You alright… it doesn't seem like it."  
"Kyle-san…"  
  
Even after death, I can still talk. …In this case, "dead" isn't quite
the right word. Just because my HP hit zero doesn't mean my character is
actually dead, so it might be more accurate to say I'm critically
injured.  
  
"I pushed myself a little too hard… I'm heading back first… I leave the
rest to you."  
  
In the game system, if your HP reaches zero, you're returned to your
registered resurrection point if you aren't revived. In this world's
setting, the reason is that the power of the \[Star Stele\] transfers
you there when you're critically injured.  
  
The \[Star Stele\] refers to the stone monument at the resurrection
point. It's also called the tears of God, and is said to share the same
source and power as a hero's… well, just think of it as God's power at
work. After all, it's what the God (system) of this world is doing.  
  
Whew… I'm glad I remembered this setting. It's necessary for role-play,
isn't it? There's a difference between doing it unknowingly and doing it
knowing the setting. …I have to remember the settings that might be
useful. I hate my forgetful brain.  
  
"Chloe, about that, is the Star Stele you're registered to right now in
the town?"  
"Yes, it is…"  
  
What's wrong, Kyle-san? He's speaking to me without honorifics, and I
want to call him out on that.  
  
"I thought so. Well, it's hard to say this, but when you return to the
town, aren't you going to run into them?"  
  
—Ah.  
  
I realized. If I die and return, won't I run into that group of flashy
gold guys? Uh oh, what do I do? Isn't it dangerous for me to return
alone like this?  
  
Ah! If I go back like this, I'll definitely get completely beaten up by
them! Even though there are soldiers in the town, it's not a completely
safe zone. Player killing is possible.  
  
Trouble. I'm in serious trouble. Kyle-san can't revive me. If he could,
he'd be doing it now.  
  
Ten seconds passed, and I should be able to return to my resurrection
point, but I can't. Even if I want to, I can't. I'll be forcibly
returned in about three minutes.  
  
"My, my… are you dying?"  
"You!?"  
  
I heard a voice. That gratingly light voice. Since I can't move my head,
I looked towards the voice with my eyes. There, as expected, was the man
in the red hood, though now he only appears gray.  
  
"At a time like this!"  
"Ah, calm down. I'm not going to harm you two now."  
  
The man in the red hood calmed Kyle-san, who started drawing his sword.
He's still chuckling as usual.  
  
"What do you want?"  
"Don't be so wary. You're Chloe, right? That magic just now, was it
yours? It was amazing! Especially that destructive power… I'd love to
recruit you into our group!"  
"Group…?"  
"Yeah! Our organization is very welcoming to kids like you who are good
at destruction!"  
  
The man in the red hood smiled like a child. Then he took something out
from inside his robe. It's something like a red bird's feather. He
tossed it towards me. The feather fluttered slowly towards me, dancing
in the wind. The moment it touched me, it emitted a warm light and
enveloped me.  
  
《Item: Phoenix Feather has been used. Do you wish to resurrect?》  
  
Apparently, it was a resurrection item. While wary of the person who
gave me the item, I pressed YES. My health bar, which was at zero,
filled up, and my vision gradually recovered color from gray.  
  
"What… was that?"  
"Shouldn't you thank me first? Oh well, think of this as a gift from me.
I don't really need your thanks."  
"Thanks? I don't think I've done anything to deserve that."  
  
I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about. After all, aren't he
and I enemies?  
  
"There are two reasons. One is the amazing magic you just used. Thank
you for showing me such destructive magic. I like that sort of thing."  
  
That magic? I did use all my power, but… I might understand that feeling
a little. Doesn't amazing magic look beautiful? It was my own magic, but
that magic looked exceptionally beautiful.  
  
"And I never liked those flashy gold guys either."  
"Aren't they your allies?"  
"No way! I only used them because they seemed useful. Would you mind not
lumping me in with those guys?"  
  
The man in the red hood angrily reacted to Kyle-san's words. He really
hates being associated with those flashy people.  
  
"The other reason is…"  
  
He continued talking with a cheerful smile. But I thought I'd seen this
man in the red hood before. Especially when I saw him in grey
earlier...  
  
"For destroying the barrier around this forest!"  
  
…I remember. That figure who was there when I was defeated by the red
beast! But why does he know that? Was he watching the scene?  
  
"Destroyed the barrier? What are you talking about?"  
"How dishonest. Until you created a crack in that barrier, there wasn't
a single entrance or exit. Yet you were inside the barrier then. If you
didn't break the barrier and enter, how else would you have gotten
inside?"  
  
Ah, I was spotted. But there's one thing I'm curious about in what he
just said.  
  
"…How did you, yourself, get inside this barrier without an opening?"  
  
Back then, I forced my way in by breaking it open. But this man, judging
by his words, entered the barrier before me.  
  
"The same way as you. I forcibly broke in. However, my entrance was
sealed by Lucille."  
  
I see. So there was a flaw in the barrier. Because Lucille-san was also
fighting this man, she couldn't fix it properly.  
  
"Because of that, I drifted through this white forest for a while… I
managed to turn the nuisance Lucille into a red beast, but I had
absolutely no way of escaping. I thought maybe if I could break the seal
then things would work out, but it's not that easy to destroy... And
just when I was at a loss, that's when I saw you!"  
  
He started babbling away about things I didn't even ask him. Thanks to
him, I understand a lot. Now that he mentions it, I did do something
that would warrant his thanks.  
  
But more than that, I now have more questions to ask.  
  
"I see. But what is this seal you speak of?"  
  
Is it about the magic circle that was floating on the lake?  
  
"Want me to tell you?"  
"Tell me."  
  
I threatened the man in the red hood by pointing my staff at him. He
raised both his hands, but his expression is still smiling, so he's
probably joking.  
  
"I saved your life, you know?"  
"I don't remember asking for help."  
"Ahaha, you're right."  
  
The man in the red hood snapped his fingers. At that moment, a flash of
light shone between us.  
  
"If you really want to know, you should ask Lucille. I don't know if
she'll tell you, though!"  
  
While I was blinded, he put some distance between us.  
  
"Chloe, I think I like you."  
"I see. I'm afraid I don't like you."  
  
Considering his attitude so far… Chloe can't help but dislike him.  
  
"Ahaha, I guess you hate me now. Oh well… I'll take my leave. Of course,
I'll be using the entrance you opened!"  
  
Please don't be so nasty. I didn't open it for you.  
  
"Wait! Who are you?!"  
"Are you curious about me? Then I'll save it as a surprise for the next
time we meet. See you again, Chloe!"  
  
Saying that, the man in the red hood disappeared. Ah… he got away.  
  
"I have a lot of questions, but I'll hold off for now."  
"I would appreciate it if you could do that."  
  
Kyle-san had a complicated look on his face. Even without asking, he
must understand from listening to our conversation just now.  
  
Who was that man? I still don't even know his name.  
The only things I know are that he was trying to break some seal in this
forest, he was hostile towards Lucille-san who was guarding it, he
belongs to some organization, and he transformed Lucille-san into a red
beast…  
  
"That's right! Lucille-san!"  
  
I heard the sound of leaves rustling. Looking in that direction, there
was a large figure wearing a black hood. It's Earl, who I had parted
ways with earlier. It seems he had decided that the battle was over and
was looking for us.  
  
"Earl, where's Lucille-san?"  
  
Earl had a black cat in his arms. But even when I spoke to it, it only
meowed, like a normal black cat.  
  
"Let's regroup with the others."  
"I agree."  
  
Those two must be fighting the red beast. Let's head over and meet up
with them.
