# 34・Miranda-san, the Laid-Back Shop Owner

Opening the door reveals a vibrant shop interior. The floral and pink
décor seems to reflect the owner's personality. The merchandise is
incredibly diverse, ranging from potions and other adventuring
necessities to everyday items, and even items you'll never know where
you'll ever use them.  
  
"Welcome~"  
  
A relaxed voice greets the customer. One might worry about the
organization of such a varied stock. Well, it's her, so I'm sure she's
managing things properly.  
  
"Hello, Miranda-san."  
  
I greeted Miranda-san, the shop owner, having become a regular customer
without even realizing it. Miranda-san noticed me and smiled back.  
  
"Ah, Chloe-chan, welcome~! Looking for something? Or are you selling?"  
"I'm selling. I made several potions, would you like to buy them?"  
"Of course~"  
  
Miranda-san gives off a relaxed impression, but she worked quickly,
counting the potions and calculating the price immediately.  
  
"Hmm, that's 33,000G in total~ Is that alright?"  
"Yes, that's fine."  
"Thank you~"  
  
She gave me a soft smile as she handed me the money.  
  
"Chloe-chan, you've graduated from beginner potions, haven't you?"  
"You noticed?"  
"Anyone would notice, since you're not selling beginner ones~"  
  
Miranda-san's smile faded.  
  
"...So, you've grown that much. Chloe-chan, you're going to the royal
capital soon, right?"  
"To the royal capital? No, I don't plan to go."  
"What? You're not going?"  
  
She seems surprised.  
  
"I don't know why you think that, but as I said, I have no plans to
go."  
"Really? Honestly?"  
"Yes. At least, I don't have a reason to go right now."  
"That's right! That's great! Yay~"  
  
Miranda-san's smile has returned, and she grabbed both my hands,
swinging them back and forth.  
  
"What's wrong, all of a sudden?"  
"Oh, sorry. I'm just so happy. Umm, most kids who graduate from beginner
potions go to the royal capital... so I thought Chloe-chan would do the
same."  
  
Ah, I see. Indeed, once players surpass level 20, they tend to leave
this town. Apparently, if you follow the quest that starts as a
continuation of the tutorial quest that you can receive from the
beginning, you'll end up at the royal capital. Even without that, most
people want to go to the royal capital rather than stay in this
beginner's town. It's like how people from the countryside long for the
city.  
  
"So many people go to the royal capital and we never see them again
after becoming friends... That's why I was so happy to hear that
Chloe-chan's not going~"  
  
Miranda-san said with a radiant smile. If she says that, I won't be able
to leave.  
  
"Now that I think about it, Chloe-chan, you formed a party."  
  
Miranda-san said, looking at Earl. Earl had been curiously examining the
merchandise.  
  
"No, he's my servant."  
"Ah, a servant~. So, you used the \[Servant Contract\] I sold you the
other day~"  
"I never expected to use it so soon."  
  
My encounter with Earl was sudden. Come to think of it, I haven't
changed the terms of the contract. Earl doesn't seem to have any
complaints so far, but I can't keep employing him without pay. I'll have
to think about it.  
  
"Oh, Miranda-san, do you sell bags?"  
"I have some~ what kind are you looking for~"  
"Well... a bag that's big enough for potions and can be attached to my
belt, and a shoulder bag."  
"Got it~. Klin, we had something like that in the warehouse, right~?"  
  
Miranda-san called out to her part-time employee and headed to the back
of the store.  
  
Actually, I've been wanting a bag. You can access items through your
inventory, but apparently, there's another way —using bags.  
  
If you reach into a bag and think about an item in your inventory, you
can take it out. It saves you the trouble of opening your inventory
every time. And taking things out of your bag doesn't feel like a game,
so that's great. All good things.  
  
However, the size of the item must be small enough to fit through the
bag's opening, and you need to remember the details of what's in your
inventory.  
  
I got two bags from Miranda-san. One is a belt bag. Potions should fit
perfectly. The other is a large shoulder bag. It looks like I should be
able to use it even with fairly large items without any problem.  
  
"The small one is 5,000G, and the shoulder bag is 8,000G~"  
"Understood. I'll take both."  
"Thank you~"  
  
I equipped the bags immediately. The belt bag will save me the trouble
of opening my inventory during combat. I gave the large shoulder bag to
Earl and put some potions in it. That way, Earl can use potions if
something happens.  
  
"By the way, are you planning to buy another \[Servant Contract\]?"  
"No."  
  
As expected of Miranda-san. If I let my guard down, she'll make me buy
all sorts of things.  
  
"Well, I'll be going now. I'm going to the forest to look for potion
ingredients."  
"Forest... are you talking about the Twilight Forest?"  
"Yes."  
  
Miranda-san looked worried.  
  
"You know... a customer who came in earlier told me... that strong
monsters are roaming around that forest right now."  
"Strong monsters?"  
"Yeah. They barely escaped with their lives. So be careful if you're
going."  
  
Strong monsters, huh? It might have something to do with what happened
in the white forest the other day.  
  
"Thank you for the warning."  
"Of course, come again~"  
  
Although she looks worried, Miranda-san waved goodbye as we left the
store.
