# 45・Let's Finish This

Following the fallen trees, we quickly caught up to Light-san,
Tsubaki-san, and the red beast.  
  
"Sorry to keep you waiting!"  
  
Kyle-san gallantly leapt in front of Light-san, who was about to be
attacked by the red beast, protecting him.  
  
"You're late! I almost died!"  
  
Light-san was sweating profusely and had lost half his HP.  
  
"We were up against eight people. Don't you think that's pretty fast?"  
  
While throwing a healing potion to Light-san, I assessed the situation.
The red beast's HP is visible. Since Niru can't share that information,
it must be shared information coming from within the party. According to
that, it's almost defeated.  
  
"Chloe-dono, it seems you were nearly killed…"  
"A few things happened… but I'm fine now."  
  
You can check everyone's status through party information. They probably
saw that I was reduced to zero HP. Even so, Tsubaki-san has also taken a
lot of damage.  
  
"Earl, please give Tsubaki-san a potion."  
  
Earl nodded, took a potion from his bag, and used it on Tsubaki-san.
There's a cooldown on using potions on others, so since I'd already used
one on Light-san, I asked Earl.  
  
"Now then… it looks like one more hit should do it."  
"Only Light-dono can purify the Chaos. The problem is how to get
Light-dono to attack."  
  
Kyle-san is currently distracting the red beast. Light-san is trying to
attack, but can't get close enough to the raging beast. Frankly,
Light-san isn't experienced in combat; he's still lacking in skill. He's
still alive only thanks to Tsubaki-san.  
  
"The red beast has a weak point on its chest. We need to get Light-dono
to target it. Can you stop its movements?"  
"……I don't know how effective my magic will be, but I can try."  
"Stop it when I give the signal. Please."  
  
Tsubaki-san dashed off. Haku, who was next to her, also spread her wings
and flew off.  
  
"Light-dono, Kyle-dono. It's as I said. When it stops moving, you
strike!"  
"Understood!"  
"What!? Seriously!?"  
  
Looking towards Tsubaki-san, her figure disappeared in a puff of smoke.
Haku, who had been flying overhead, appeared instead. Thinking something
was up, I looked up and saw her reappear in a cloud of smoke.  
  
She drew her sword as she fell from the sky. A clear metallic clang
echoed. The sound attracted the red beast's attention. It looked up,
raised its front legs and stood.  
  
The red beast swung its claws at Tsubaki-san, but she deflected it with
her sword, cleverly using the beast's front paws as a foothold to stay
airborne. I knew she was physically gifted, as she can fly quickly
across rooftops, but I didn't know she could do this.  
  
"Chloe-dono!"  
"I understand!"  
  
This is no time to be mesmerized by Tsubaki-san's moves. Following her
signal, I activated the \[Dark Bind\] I had been chanting and waiting to
use. Chains of darkness wrapped around the red beast's limbs, hindering
its movement. The sustained damage effect didn't seem very effective, so
I didn't deal much damage. The restraint effect was also weaker than
usual.  
  
On the bound red beast's chest, among the festering skin, a
reddish-black stone-like object was visible. That must be the weak
point. But at that height, a sword can't reach it.  
  
"Light! Jump!"  
  
Kyle-san held up his shield as if to tell him to use it as a
springboard.  
  
"W-will I reach it!?"  
"You will! But hurry! We need to do this while it's restrained."  
"Aaah, fine! I get it!"  
  
Light-san jumped using Kyle-san's shield as a launchpad. With the added
momentum from Kyle-san's push from below, Light-san leapt powerfully.  
  
"This is the end!"  
"GAAAAAAA!!!"  
  
Light-san struck the red beast with his greatsword, Rex. The stone-like
object embedded in its chest shattered, and the red beast roared. In
that moment, light enveloped the red beast. Its slimy, dark red skin
dissolved into particles of light, and its massive body shrunk.  
  
When the light subsided, the red beast was gone, and a single human was
laying on the ground.  
  
"Lucille-san!!"  
  
She was the same as the Lucille-san we'd seen in town. No, this is
Lucille-san herself. Kyle-san gently lifted her, and she opened her
eyes.  
  
"……Was I saved?"  
"Yes, that's right. I'm so glad…"  
  
Lucille-san looked over her body. Kyle-san smiled, relieved.  
  
"This is all thanks to my hero's strength!"  
  
Of course, Light-san is boasting with his arms crossed.  
  
"……With this, the quest is complete."  
"Yes, it is."  
  
I nodded at Tsubaki-san's words. We had completed Lucille-san's request
to defeat the red beast. We also saved Lucille-san herself.  
  
"That should settle it."  
  
Daybreak. The rising sun seemed to congratulate us.  
  
  
"Hahaha. First of all, let me thank you for completing my request."  
  
We moved to Lucille-san's house. When we returned to town, we were
concerned about that flashy group, but luckily we didn't run into
them.  
  
"Not only did you put a stop to the red hooded man's plot and defeat the
red beast, but you also helped me. I'm truly grateful!"  
  
Sitting in a chair, Lucille-san stroked her black cat and looked around
at us with a smile. There were a lot of things that happened, but we
managed to get through it somehow, so I'm glad.  
  
"……The quest is complete. Is there a reward?"  
"Tsubaki-san, you're jumping the gun…"  
  
Kyle-san stopped Tsubaki-san, who immediately brought up the reward.
Kyle-san refers to me and Light-san without honorifics, but not
Tsubaki-san.  
  
"Hahaha. Honesty is fine. To be frank, there's a chance I wouldn't have
been able to pay you."  
"What!? Seriously!?"  
"Don't be so angry. It was only thanks to your power, Light, that I was
able to give you the reward."  
  
Lucille-san, you're a tough person. Without Light-san, the Chaos
wouldn't have been purified. If he hadn't been there, or if we had
defeated the red beast without him, we would have been working for
free.  
  
"Then I'll give you a reward of 100,000G and this Lucille-stamped
bracelet. Cherish it, okay?"  
  
《Received reward from Lucille》  
  
《Epic Quest: \[Defeat the Red Beast\] Completed: Rank S:
Congratulations. Received 5 Bonus Skill Points.》  
  
《Upload video of this epic quest to history?》  
  
Ah, so it was an Epic Quest after all…  
  
"Whaaat? Epic!? What's this? What do I do… Later…."  
  
Light-san exclaimed in surprise. He apparently didn't know. He started
nodding as if responding to someone. His eyes were on Kyle-san… He must
have sent a private chat.  
  
"Then, I'll take my leave."  
  
Having received her reward, Tsubaki-san turned and left coolly. The
start was strange, but given her character, she probably wouldn't
normally take on such a request.  
  
"Wait! You haven't apologized yet!"  
  
Light-san hurried after Tsubaki-san.  
  
"Well then, I'll take my leave as well. Let me know if you need anything
else."  
"Alright, take care."  
  
Kyle-san bowed to Lucille-san and left. So, are we the only ones left?  
  
"What's wrong? I can't pay you more."  
"No, that's not it. I still have some questions for you."  
"Is that so?"  
  
Lucille-san smiled. You really are a secretive person.  
  
"I just don't like leaving without any answers."  
"Oh dear… I wish you would just forget what you learned from this
incident and leave without asking anything. That way, you wouldn't know
anything unnecessary and wouldn't get involved in any trouble…"  
"That's what I want. Even if it means I find out unnecessary
information, I'll get involved until I'm satisfied. That troublesome
matter, you see."  
  
Let's settle this interrogation, shall we, Lucille-san?  
  
"Hahaha. What a troublesome child. --But, it's not like I dislike that
about you."  
  
Lucille-san's smile vanished. As if she put on another mask, her
expression turned cold and sharp.  
  
"If you're prepared to find out, then come. Chloe… I'll be waiting for
you."  
  
A sudden gust of wind blew. I, Niru, and Earl were blown out of
Lucille-san's room.  
  
"This is…"  
  
We found ourselves in the cleaned room. The hidden door behind the
bookshelf. The door vanished the moment it closed. Not just the hidden
door. All the furniture —the tables, chairs, and bookshelves— had
vanished. It's as if the house had been empty since the beginning...
