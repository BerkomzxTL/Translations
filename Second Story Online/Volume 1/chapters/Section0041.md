# 41・The Man in the Red Hood

The place where the red beast appeared is the \[Twilight Forest\]. So,
after getting ready, we arrived at the entrance. Now, the question is
how to find it.  
  
*‘I know the beast's location.'*  
“Is that true, Lucille-san?”  
  
I looked at the black cat being held by Earl.  
  
*‘…It's to the west. —!? This presence… it seems we should hurry…'*  
  
West… if it's west, could it be over there?  
Since we were told to hurry, we started moving west. Because I'm
familiar with the forest, I ended up leading the way.  
  
“What are we in such a hurry for?”  
*‘It's on the move. …And, sorry, but it seems we'll have to deal with
something other than the red beast…'*  
  
Lucille-san answered Kyle-san as we ran.  
Without time to think, we arrived in the west. It's around where I
entered the White Forest before.  
  
“That is…”  
  
There was a familiar group there. Eight people wearing gold.  
No, nine today. One person is wearing a red robe and hood, making them
stand out even more in an already conspicuous group.  
  
*‘…What are you doing here?'*  
  
Slipping out of Earl's arms, Lucille-san stepped forward.  
The group noticed us because of her voice.  
  
“Tch… Other players are here already. And what's that, a cat?”  
*‘Answer my question. What are you doing here?'*  
  
The man who seemed to be the leader from that time stepped forward from
the group.  
He looked at us, and then glared at the talking black cat. He snorted,
then spoke.  
  
“We came to hunt the red beast. Are you guys also targeting the red
beast?”  
“Yes, we also came to hunt it. Since we have the same goal, why don't we
cooperate and defeat it together?”  
  
Kyle-san offered a smile and his hand to the man. But his hand was
slapped away.  
  
“Huh? Don't be ridiculous. We're the ones who'll defeat it. Don't get in
our way.”  
“What are you saying? The red beast is tough. We should cooperate
here…”  
“Shut up! I'm telling you I'm not going to participate in your little
pretend play!”  
  
Kyle-san looked at the man with a confused expression. Pretend play,
huh? Those words seemed to include contempt towards us (role-players).  
  
“Hey hey, there's no need to mind them. I'd rather you prioritize my
request. I won't pay you unless you defeat the red beast faster than
them.”  
“That's true… Let's go!”  
  
The man in the red hood spoke to the leader-like man. The man, slightly
irritated, nodded to the man in the red hood, and they headed towards
the deeper part of the forest, towards the entrance leading to the White
Forest.  
  
*‘Wait! Don't go!'*  
  
The man in the red hood stood in Lucille-san's way as she tried to chase
after them.  
  
*‘You…'*  
“Oh, is that Lucille? You're persistent, huh? I never thought you'd be
acting in such a form.”  
*‘Hmph, not everything will go exactly as you planned. It seems you're
still struggling.'*  
“Ahaha, that's right. But, tonight, I will destroy it. Look forward to
it!”  
  
The man in the red hood spoke in a very light tone. His mouth, the only
visible part, smiling mischievously.  
  
*‘I won't let you!'*  
“As expected of Lucille. But, is that alright? If you're concerned with
me… ahah!”  
  
He put his hand to his mouth and laughed. He has many rings on his hand,
which sparkled as he laughed and moved, as if to taunt us. The black
cat's fur stood on end at the attitude of the man in the red hood.  
  
“Why are you following her, you guys? Lucille is deceiving you.”  
“Deceiving us… What do you mean?”  
“Ask her yourself? Well, she probably won't tell you!”  
  
The man in the red hood was engulfed in flames, then he disappeared,
laughing. Just who is he?  
  
*‘What are you doing! Chase after him quickly!'*  
“…But our objective is to hunt the red beast? And is what he said
true?”  
*‘…That… is…'*  
  
Lucille-san hesitated. But she immediately looked at us.  
  
*‘…I haven't deceived you. Anyway, stop that man in the red hood. The
red beast can wait.'*  
“We received a request from you to hunt the red beast. Are you telling
us to do something else?”  
*‘If we leave both the red beast and him alone, it will eventually lead
to a great disaster. The priority now is that man, not the red beast.
…It will be impossible to easily destroy that thing, but we can't leave
him alone.'*  
“Therefore, we haven't received any other request from you besides
hunting the red beast. If it's absolutely necessary, can you tell us the
situation? Otherwise, I can't trust you.”  
  
“Chloe-san, calm down. We don't have time to argue here.”  
  
Kyle-san intervened to soothe me as I pressed Lucille-san as the black
cat.  
  
"I think it would be better to stop that man. Maybe it's because I can't
trust him myself? Besides, if you believe what she says, it's dangerous
to leave him alone. In that case, you should do it even if it's not what
the request said."  
  
Kyle-san looked straight at Lucille-san. He is righteous and kind.
Perhaps because he is like that, he wants to listen to Lucille-san.  
  
“The man suggested that those guys will deal with it, so we can go after
it after we finish with the man. What do you all think?”  
  
Kyle-san looked around to hear everyone's opinions.  
  
“I… I don't really understand, but I want to go after the red beast
where I can show my hero's strength. And I don't want to be beaten by
those gold-plated guys.”  
  
It seems Light-san wants to prioritize the red beast. Indeed, Light-san,
who was asked for his power as a hero. He wants to prioritize the red
beast because he's aware that purifying Chaos is his role.  
  
*‘…Please stop that man before killing the red beast. That's all I can
say right now.'*  
  
Lucille-san still won't explain the situation. But her voice is
trembling. She seems to be trembling with the anguish of wanting to say
something but unable to. …What should we do?  
  
“I can't trust her, she won't tell us the situation. But I wonder
why..."  
  
The first time I learned of Lucille-san's name was from that
apprentice's book. A book created to guide beginners. Lucille-san's name
was there as the author.  
  
“As an aspiring mage, I was helped by your book. Perhaps that is why,
even though I can't trust you, I'm sure you're a person worthy of
respect as the author of that book.”  
  
Chloe is still only half-baked as a mage and a witch. I think it is
precisely because of this that she has a high regard for Lucille-san,
who is a better magician than her.  
  
My eyes met with Niru's. Niru nodded slightly after looking at
Lucille-san. It was as if he was saying it's alright.  
  
“…I owe the red beast a great debt, but let's go stop that man as you
say.”  
  
Lucille-san's words were desperate.  
  
“…It doesn't matter to me. The original request was to fulfill her wish.
It's just that the content has changed slightly. As long as I get paid,
it doesn't matter to me what happens to her.”  
  
Tsubaki-san spoke dryly. She doesn't seem to care about the employer's
circumstances when it comes to completing the request. …So that
leaves.  
  
“Ah, I get it, I get it. We just have to agree, right? I'm fine with the
man too. That guy was annoying too.”  
  
Light-san, who had everyone's attention, answered while slightly
sulking. With this, we all agreed.  
  
*‘…Thank you. Then I will guide the way. I know where that person
is.'*  
  
We followed Lucille-san, who has started running. The destination is, of
course, inside the White Forest.
