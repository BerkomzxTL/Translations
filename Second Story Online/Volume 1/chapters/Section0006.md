# 6・Weeds Are Surprisingly Tasty

Good morning. Ah, the morning sun in real life is dazzling, isn't it?
It's five o'clock in the morning. It's not that I kept playing all
night, you know. Yesterday, after shopping at the market, it was dinner
time, so I logged out. I thought I’d play again after dinner, but for
some reason I wasn’t able to log in.  
  
So I decided last night before bed that I'd play SSO before breakfast.
Ah, I didn't wake up early. I always wake up around this time. It's
morning, so I quietly took out my VR equipment and put it on. I've been
using it for a while, so the operation is perfect. I selected SSO from
among the several applications, and the game immediately started up.  
  
Here I am again. Dairode Town. It seems like it’s night now. It's my
time, my time for dark magic! Going out hunting would be nice. But I
have another purpose this time. I’ve done some research on the strategy
sites beforehand. With this, I won't get scammed anymore.  
  
No, wait. What I looked up was about making money. I haven't used my
\[Alchemy\] skill at all. Apparently, it lets you make potions and such.
So I came up with the idea of making money through production jobs.  
I picked this up for the simple reason that witches make potions, right?
Well... it looks like it might be useful, or rather, since I have it, I
might as well put it to good use.  
  
To do that, I need to find materials. But first, according to my
research, I need tools to do alchemy. I’ll buy those first. A beginner's
alchemy kit costs 500G. ...My starting money is supposedly 1000G, so
that’s expensive.  
Shopping is mostly done through a purchase screen, but to bring that up,
I have to talk to the shopkeeper. Yes, I encountered the language
barrier here too, but I managed somehow.  
  
I want to learn the language quickly... It still doesn't appear in the
list. Are you telling me to speak more?  
  
Well, now I'm in the \[Twilight Forest\]. According to the information,
this forest has a lot of herbs used in alchemy. I came to gather them.
The \[Twilight Forest\] seems like a place beginners shouldn't go near.
After all, it's a permanently dark forest, and the monsters that attack
are nothing like those on the plains. There's the problem of getting
lost in the forest and, worst-case scenario, only being able to leave
via death and resurrection.  
  
However, darkness is an advantage. My Dark Magic is strengthened. The
biggest problem is that I can't see my surroundings in the dark, though.
I leveled up a bit on the plains, so I'm level 8 now. I think my
equipment is still effective. If I just gather near the forest entrance,
getting lost shouldn't be a problem. I was fighting rabbits near the
entrance last time too.  
Whatever the case, if it becomes dangerous, run away. That's the best
thing to do.  
  
So, I started gathering at the forest entrance. ...But I ran into
another problem. There are many plants that look like herbs there. But I
don't know what kind of plants they are. Even looking at the pictures of
the herbs I took from the strategy site, I couldn't find anything that
looked like them.  
  
"...They're not at the entrance?"  
  
I thought that, but the reason seems to be different. Apparently, you
need a plant appraisal skill to distinguish herbs from ordinary weeds.  
So even if I know what herbs look like on a strategy site, I can't find
them. I'm trying to get the appraisal skill, but it's not showing up in
the list yet. The appraisal skill is an initial skill. So, if the skill
master in the starting town teaches it, anyone can learn the skill...
but I can't talk to NPCs.  
  
"Even here... even here, the language!"  
  
Nobody would think that you need language to gather medicinal herbs.  
By the way, according to the strategy site, the language skill is
acquired by talking to the locals enough that it will appear in the
list. I guess I haven't talked enough yet.  
I should go back to town and find opportunities to talk to the
residents. But before that, I have to gather. It's true I can't tell the
difference. I don't have the appraisal skill. But I think there might be
other ways to tell them apart.  
  
I pulled up a piece of grass. It looks like a common weed with long,
thin leaves. I took a bite of the leaf.  
  
"...Sweet."  
  
The leaf tasted sweet. I felt strangely energized... or did my health
just slightly recover? My HP bar is full, so I can't tell, but I think I
felt a recovery effect.  
I pulled up another plant from the same spot and ate it. It tasted sweet
again. And the green effect that appears when you recover appeared
again.  
  
This is probably an herb that's used to make recovery potions. I put it
in my item storage, but it just shows up as a weed, so I'm not sure if
it's really an herb.  
  
For now, I'll keep looking while eating them one by one.  

No taste, no change. This is just grass. This one is... sweet. So this
is an herb. This one is sweet too... no wait. What's this? Damage taken?
Poisoned. Poisonous herb? Let's keep it separate for now. Next, sweet,
my HP recovered from the poison, medicinal herb. Next, oh, numbness...
paralysis herb! This one is... sleeping state...

  
I almost died from paralysis, poison, and sleep for a moment. I'm so
glad no enemies came at that time. Still... why do I have to eat weeds
even though I’m in a game world? Ah, I shouldn't think about it.  
  
So, the result of my efforts:  
  
Herbs? ×20  
Poisonous Plant? ×10  
Paralyzing Grass? ×5  
Sleep Grass? ×5  
  
There were about ten more plants that didn't have any effect but tasted
similar to herbs. I'll keep them for now. They all look the same, and
they're treated as weeds in the item storage, so I have to be careful
not to mix them up. All my hard work would be for nothing.  
  
Now that I have what seems to be herbs, I can finally do some alchemy.
It took so long to get here. And it's all because I can't speak the
language...  
But breakfast time has already arrived. I'm not hungry because I ate
weeds, but my real self is hungry. So it's time for breakfast and a
break.
