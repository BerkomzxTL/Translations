# 50・Witch of the Forest of the Dead

"Cough... Just how long has this place been left uncleaned?!"  
  
My hand slipped as I tried to lift a book, causing several to fall to
the floor. The impact sent dust, thick with neglect, swirling into the
air.  
  
"I'm fine, Earl."  
  
Earl looked concerned, so I reassured him. He was holding a dirty,
blackened rag. He's helping with the cleaning too.  
  
I took a deep breath and began gathering the scattered books. Most
seemed to be grimoires; among them were several I recognized as
Lucille-san's.  
  
"I never imagined this house was here in a place like this."  
  
We were in a house, a warm room with the pleasant smell of wood. There's
a table and chairs, a bookshelf overflowing with grimoires, what
appeared to be an alchemy pot, and shelves of ingredients and medicines.
A loft above serves as a bedroom.  
  
Everything—furniture and floor—was covered in a thick layer of dust.
It's uninhabitable. Earl and I are cleaning it together.  
  
This is Lucille-san's house. Or rather, \*was\* Lucille-san's house. She
said that since I'm the current guardian, it'll now be mine.  
  
It's located not far from that lake. From the outside, it's a log cabin
with a terrace. I never even knew it existed.  
  
Hehehe… This alone made inheriting the role of guardian worthwhile! I
mean, a log cabin nestled deep within the forest? This is the
quintessential witch's house.  
  
Since the original owner was Lucille-san, the interior was perfect,
fully furnished. And I get to live here just for protecting the
forest.  
  
"Hehe… My witch role-play is overflowing!"  
  
I caught Niru's eye. I thought he'd been sleeping quietly by the window,
but he was looking at me with a disappointed expression. Why? Can't you
see how wonderful this is?  
  
"Meow."  
  
A black cat entered through the open window and sat next to Niru.  
  
"Lucille-san, where have you been? Can't you help with the cleaning?"  
"Meow."  
"……Lucille-san?"  
"Meow."  
  
She didn't respond, acting like a regular cat. Then she started grooming
Niru, who looked at me with displeased, narrowed eyes.  
  
"Are you messing with me?"  
*'I'm not messing around!'*  
"Whoa!?"  
  
Just as I received a sudden reply, a bird flew in through the window.  
  
*'You still have much to learn.'*  
"Oh, so you're possessing a bird now?"  
*'Yes, flying is fun!'*  
  
The little bird flitted around me. Lucille-san really is just playing
around.  
  
"But more importantly! Stop playing around and help me clean a
little!"  
*'How can I, in my current state? Besides, this is your house now. Clean
your own house. I'm going for a flight in the sky.'*  
"That's cheating, just wait!"  
  
Ignoring me, Lucille-san, in bird form, flew out the window into the
sky. I'm a little envious that she can fly.  
  
Niru followed Lucille-san out the window, and then the black cat
followed suit.  
  
"Certainly, you animals can't help with cleaning… but…"  
  
Show a little more willingness to help. Like Tsubaki-san's Haku. As if
to comfort me, Earl put a hand on my shoulder.  
  
"It seems you're my only ally. Let's do our best to clean up."  
  
I picked up my broom and resolved myself. I'll fly someday too. I want
to fly.  
  
Just as I was about to resume work, my alarm rang, and a window appeared
on my screen.  
  
"Ah, more people are approaching…"  
  
The window displayed an image. As the guardian, I apparently became the
administrator of the \[Twilight Forest\], able to grasp everything.
Thanks to this, I can see what goes on inside the forest. The image
showed the entrance to the west side of the forest. Four figures were
walking around there. Judging by their equipment, they seemed to be
players clearing the forest.  
  
They don't seem to be coming here. But just in case… Luckily, even
though the red-hooded man knows about this place, the information
doesn't seem to be widely spread. To prevent this place from becoming
more well-known, I should check it out.  
  
If they seem lost, I can guide them.  
  
Leaving the cleaning to Earl, I took Niru, who had been running away
from the black cat, and went outside the White Forest.  
  
"What are you doing out here in the woods?"  
  
I called out to the people wandering in the forest from behind.  
  
"A player?"  
"Look closer! It's the potion seller! The one from the video the other
day!"  
"Then we can get some information! Um, we heard there's an entrance to
the White Forest around here. Do you know anything about it?"  
  
They weren't clearing the forest. They're looking for the White Forest.
It seems that since my video went up, more players have been searching
for that area. Curiosity, or perhaps another purpose. Either way, it's
incredibly troublesome. Though, I was the one who uploaded the video…  
  
"The White Forest? What's that?"  
"Don't lie. You were in that video, right? Then you know how to get
there, right? Can you tell us."  
"Come on, don't be stingy, Witch-chan, tell us~!"  
  
Even if you say that, I can't tell you because of my position. Even if
you call me a witch, I can't tell you this time.  
  
"How about some potions?"  
"No, we don't need potions… Wait, wasn't the keyword Witch? Your
reaction is different."  
"The forum information might be outdated…"  
  
…Apparently, my strategy walkthrough has spread without me realizing. No
wonder so many people in this forest have been calling me "Witch-san" or
"Witch-chan."  
  
But, I'm not as cheap as I was back then, so I won't just spill
everything when called a witch! I won't react to your cheap witch
calls!  
  
"Whatever. It seems pointless to ask anyway."  
"Yeah."  
"Well then, we'll excuse ourselves."  
  
They turned their backs and started walking again.  
  
"Wait. That path doesn't lead to the forest exit… If you go that way,
you'll never get out."  
"We're looking for the White Forest—"  
"Come on, let's just ignore it."  
  
...Just like that, they disappeared into the depths of the forest,
ignoring me.  
  
Their actions were neither hostile nor friendly, they ignored me. I
shall respond accordingly, as the guardian.  
  
I am now the \[Guardian of the Seal\]. My authority extends throughout
this forest. In other words, I am the administrator, the ruler of this
forest.  
  
"…I did warn you."  
  
Let's do a little something to their path. As administrator, I can do
that. This will prevent them from reaching or leaving the White Forest.
They will wander within this forest forever, lost in an illusionary
maze. Let them know the terror of this forest.  
  
It's alright. There's a way out. This place is also known as the Forest
of the Dead. In other words, they just need to die. It's not scary
because it's a game. And as a character, they'll only suffer serious
injuries, then return to town to revive. They might lose some money,
experience, and, if unlucky, items, but it's for their escape.  
  
See? There's nothing to fear.  
  
"This is also necessary to keep the secret, so it can't be helped."  
  
Lucille-san said it was fine to do this much.  
So please don't look at me like that, Niru.
