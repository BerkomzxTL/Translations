# 42・The True Identity of the Red Beast

Just like the last time I was here, the forest was shrouded in gray
trees and pure white mist. The white mist made it hard to get a sense of
direction in the forest.  
I could barely keep up with the black cat running in front of me without
losing sight of it.  
  
“I didn't know there was a place like this in this forest.”  
  
Kyle-san, who was running next to me, muttered to himself.  
  
*‘…This place is usually hidden. It's only natural you didn't know about
it. The barrier is broken now, that's why you can enter.'*  
  
“You're awfully knowledgeable, aren't you, Lucille-san?”  
  
Lucille-san, the black cat running ahead, navigated the forest without
hesitation, as if she knew exactly where she's going.  
  
“A place hidden by a barrier… does that mean this place is that
important?"  
*‘…Some curiosity is best left undisturbed, Chloe.'*  
  
Oh dear. I've been warned. It seems I shouldn't know.  
As we talked, the forest gradually began to open up.  
  
“This is…”  
  
Before us lies a large lake. The white fog has dissipated, revealing a
clear view. The surface reflected the night sky, shimmering
brilliantly.  
No, that's not the only thing shining. Floating on the water's surface
is a red magic circle, pulsing with light, causing ripples on the
water's surface. Crackling lightning dances around it, emitting a low
whine.  
  
As beautiful as it was, I could tell at a glance that it was an unusual
sight.  
  
On the lakeshore, a man in a red hood was reaching towards the lake
where the magic circle was floating. He must be the one causing the
phenomenon.  
  
A dark shadow fell upon him.  
  
“…Oh well. It was a nice place…”  
  
The man in the red hood created a magical barrier, deflecting the
attack. Of course, it was Tsubaki-san who launched the surprise
attack.  
Her blade scraped against the barrier with a grating sound, but it
showed no sign of breaking. Seeing this, Tsubaki-san immediately moved
away from the man.  
  
As the man stepped away from the lake, the light subsided. The red magic
circle turned blue, signaling a change.  
  
“Ahaha. Lucille, you really do love to interfere with my plans.”  
*‘I told you I wouldn't let you have your way.'*  
  
He directed an irritating smile towards us. We raised our weapons, wary
of the man in the red hood.  
  
“Ha… outnumbered, huh? Oh well, I've found what I was looking for. I'll
come back to destroy it later.”  
*‘Who do you think will let you escape?'*  
“Hey, Lucille. It's good that you remember your mission, but… I think
it's also best not to forget that your life may soon be destroyed,
okay?”  
*‘That is…'*  
  
Lucille-san's life destroyed? Does that mean she'll?  
  
“Destroyed… Lucille-san, we need an explanation.”  
“What does that mean, Lucille-san?”  
“Hey, what's going on, Lucille?!”  
  
Tsubaki-san also silently watched Lucille-san, who shook her head from
side to side.  
  
*‘…That doesn't matter right now. Let's capture him quickly—'*  
“Lying is bad, Lucille. It's okay, I'll tell them for you.”  
*‘Stop it!'*  
“The red beast you're all trying to defeat… its true identity is
Lucille!”  
  
Eh? Lucille-san is the red beast?!  
While we froze in shock, the conversation continued.  
  
“Yes, the red beast that mercilessly attacks people… that's Lucille. She
didn't tell you anything? Well, of course she couldn't. How could she
say ‘I'm the red beast, a murderous monster'? Ahahaha!”  
*‘Shut up! I became like this because of you!'*  
“Oh, scary, scary. …But more importantly, aren't you all starting to
wake up? You were deceived, you see. Ahaha, ahahahaha!”  
  
The man in the red hood couldn't stop laughing. The black cat,
Lucille-san, gritted her teeth.  
  
“Could you please be quiet for a moment?”  
  
His laughter is too irritating, so I fired a \[Shadow Arrow\] at him.
The magic was blocked by his barrier, but he stopped laughing.  
  
“…What are you going to do? You've been following the orders of a
murderer, haven't you? Isn't it strange that you're attacking me?”  
“There's nothing strange about it. We haven't been deceived by her.”  
  
I smiled at Lucille-san through her familiar, the black cat. The woman
we met in town isn't her true form, I suspect.  
  
“She hasn't told us much of the truth. But she hasn't lied.”  
  
Kyle-san also smiled at her. He's right. She hasn't told the truth, but
she hasn't lied. And there's another reason.  
  
“If Lucille really is the red beast, it's strange that she'd ask us to
defeat herself. To me, it sounds like you're the one lying and deceiving
us.”  
  
Light-san drew his greatsword, Rex, which reflected starlight like holy
light.  
Tsubaki-san silently focused her strength on her blade. Haku, who was
beside her, also glared at the man.  
  
“…Ha, my casual lie didn't fool you after all. But it's true that
Lucille is the red beast.”  
“Don't talk nonsense!”  
“It's true… Lucille said it herself, didn't she? Something about ‘I
became like this…'”  
  
Those words caught my attention too. I glanced at Lucille-san.  
  
*‘…What he says is true. My current body is tainted by Chaos, and it
turned me into that ugly red beast.'*  
  
A heavy silence fell. The red beast, the beast that attacked me, is
Lucille-san.  
Realizing this, I instinctively fired another \[Shadow Arrow\] at the
man in the red hood.  
  
“Attacking again, how cruel.”  
“Cruel? What are you talking about? You're the one who turned
Lucille-san into the red beast, aren't you?”  
“Well, that's true. There's no need to hide it. She was in my way, so I
corrupted her with Chaos. Ha… twisting and destroying something that was
once human so easily… the power of Chaos is amazing!”  
  
The man in the red hood spoke excitedly.  
  
*‘You really are that… Ugh!?'*  
“Lucille-san!”  
  
The black cat suddenly collapsed. I rushed to her side, hearing
Lucille-san's pained groan.  
  
“Oh dear, your body seems to be near death. I'm glad they're faithfully
carrying out my request!”  
“She's supposed to be tainted by Chaos… she shouldn't be so easily
defeated. Besides, without the power of a hero…”  
“Well, the power of a hero might be more efficient. But you can defeat
her normally. But in that case… you won't be able to properly purify the
Chaos, which means Lucille will die!”  
  
What… Lucille-san will die if the Chaos isn't properly purified with the
power of a hero?  
At that moment, a roaring sound rang out from behind us. The sound of
trees being felled, followed by a loud splash as something plunged into
the lake.  
  
“That's…”  
  
Turning around, I saw the red beast. It was lying on the lakeshore. Its
movements slow and it was clearly on the verge of death.  
  
Its body is red and rotten. Blood flowed from fresh wounds, staining the
shore crimson. Each pained groan from the beast was mirrored by
Lucille-san's pained cries through the cat in my arms.  
  
“Attack! We can defeat it soon!”  
  
A group of golden-armored warriors emerged from the forest and
surrounded the beast. No, if those people defeat the red beast—  
  
“Now, now, you don't seem to have time to worry about me. Why don't you
go help them? Although, if you don't have the power of a hero, Lucille
won't survive, ahaha!”  
  
The man in the red hood disappeared. It's frustrating, but he's right.
We should prioritize Lucille-san for now.  
  
*‘My matter is inconsequential. Defeat that man…'*  
“Lucille-san. I don't think anyone would listen to that wish. Still, why
didn't you tell us? If you had told us from the beginning…”  
  
Not “defeat the red beast,” but “help me, I've become the red beast.” If
she had said that, we wouldn't have been so suspicious.  
  
*‘…At first, you were supposed to defeat it, weren't you? That's why I
didn't say anything. It was more convenient that way.'*  
“What was convenient…? Are you still being secretive at this point?”  
  
Is there something else? What are you trying to hide…?  
She probably won't tell me even if I ask. We don't have time.
Lucille-san's life is fading.  
  
I entrusted Lucille-san to Earl. Please stay hidden with her somewhere
safe.  
  
“Let's go save Lucille-san.”  
  
I looked at my companions. We all seem to have the same goal.
