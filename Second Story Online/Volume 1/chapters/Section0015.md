# 15・Let's Role-Play

Logging in, I was greeted by my best friend, Darkness. Is that a strange
expression? I'm active at night, so I have to be friends with
Darkness.  
  
I summoned Niru and he's already asleep on my shoulder. …It's night now,
but it's fine.  
I was thinking of making potions, but since it's night, I'd rather go
hunting.  
  
I think there was a quest to defeat goblins in the eastern region. Let's
try to accept that quest. My language skills have improved, so it's
perfect timing.  
  
Oh, there's a small forest near the place where you can accept the
extermination quest. It's not as large as the \[Twilight Forest\].  
  
But this forest seems to have herbs and such. I might be able to gather
some while hunting. That's right… it seems the village where I can
accept the extermination quest relatively close to this forest is… Berry
Village.  
  
By the way, I haven't opened the map until now. I know why. It's like
when you're heading to a place you know and you're imagining the path.
It's probably thanks to the \[Local Knowledge\] skill.  
  
The \[Local Knowledge\] skill seems to tell me about places that have
been explored on the map. Rather than telling me, it means that my
character knows a lot about the land.  
Since \[Local Knowledge\] seems to be a skill that manifests from the
character's experience and knowledge, it seems that it won't be able to
exert its ability in completely unfamiliar lands or regions with no
information.  
  
Well, let's head to Berry Village for now. I won't get lost on the
streets of this town. Just walk towards the East Gate.  
  
The Eastern region seems to have fewer people than the last time I came
here. I wonder where the top players in the second group are now. I'm
sure they haven't gone to the kingdom yet.  
  
As for the early access group… I don't know much about them. Most of the
top players in the first group are said to be role-players. They seem to
be moving in different places, so I have no idea.  
  
I walked along the plains road and came to a fork in the road where
there was a sign. I walked down one of the paths without getting lost,
and a village that looked like Berry Village came into view. The
bonfires were dazzling. I don't particularly dislike light, but as a
dark mage, I've developed a subconscious aversion to it.  
  
"Whoa! What a surprise! A person…?"  
  
I startled the soldier at the entrance to the village. I'm sorry, I'm
sure it was hard to see me in my black cloak. I'll bow my head in
apology and greeting.  
  
"Excuse me, I heard that I can receive a goblin extermination request
here."  
"Did you come to receive the kobold's punishment?"  
"No…"  
  
Due to my language skills, it was conveyed in words I didn't quite
understand. This has been happening a lot lately. I sometimes mishear
the other person's words. It seems that there's a certain probability of
translation failure that results in this.  
  
"Ah, a goblin extermination request. In that case, you should go to the
village chief's house."  
  
This time I didn't fail. That's good.  
  
"But to have two of them come in the middle of the night like this.
There haven't been many people to get rid of them lately, so I'm
glad."  
"Is that so?"  
  
…Apparently, there's someone else who came to this village to take on a
request. Let's go there for now.  
  
The village chief's house was in a prominent place in the village. Even
though it's midnight, the lights were bright, making it easy to find.  
  
"Oh, you are…"  
  
As I was thinking that, I was spoken to by someone standing in front of
the village chief's house. Thanks to the night vision effect and the
surrounding light, I can see the person clearly. A knight in pure white
armor. A handsome young man with blond hair and blue eyes.  
  
"This is a surprise. To meet such a lovely young lady… is this the
guidance of fate?"  
  
Chloe is cute now, after all. I made her look that way.  
  
However, only someone with this young man's looks could get away with
saying such a line. He's also got movie-star-level good looks. But even
with such looks, he acts accordingly and carries himself well. If he is
a player, he has incredibly high acting skills. I want to learn from
him.  
  
Well, I don't know yet if he's a player… but I'm sure he's a
role-player. If he's going to act, I have to act too. After all, I'm a
role-player too.  
  
"Thank you for the compliment."  
  
Chloe was a viscount's daughter. A woman with such a past would be able
to lightly brush off words like these.  
  
"It's not a compliment at all. …My name is Kyle. I'd like to know your
name, lovely young lady."  
"Please call me Chloe."  
  
Saying this, I lifted the hem of my dress a little and greeted him like
a noble lady.  
Ah, role-playing is fun. I couldn't do proper role-playing because of
the language differences until now.  
  
"A very dubious (lovely) name."  
  
…Language Skills-san isn't reading the room. Ah, Kyle-san's sparkling
smile is ruined. I'm sorry. I'll raise my language skill level as soon
as possible.  
  
"…Ah, I'd also like to know the name of the child on your shoulder."  
"This is Niru. My familiar."  
  
When I looked over my shoulder, Niru, who I thought was asleep, was
awake. And he's glaring at Kyle-san. He's staring at Kyle-san intensely
with a suspicious look on his face.  
  
"Does he hate me?"  
"...sorry."  
  
Niru, I don't think this person is bad. So please don't be so wary. He
gave me a look that seemed like he was concerned about me.  
It's okay, if he were a bad person, I'd blow him away with dark magic.
…Please stop looking at me with a disappointed look now.  
  
"By the way, Chloe-san, are you also here to receive an extermination
request?"  
"Yes, that's right."  
"The truth is, so am I. …It must be fate, would you like to accept the
extermination request together with me?"  
  
《You received a party invitation from Kyle. Will you join the
party?》  
  
Hmm… yes. This is also fate. There's no particular reason to refuse, and
since we're role-players, it's a great opportunity.  
  
"Yes."  
  
I'll answer YES to the received invitation request.  
  
"Then, for a little while, I shall protect you as Chloe-san's personal
knight."  
  
Ah, Language Skills-san, you read the room. Thank you. I witnessed a
perfect role-play. Ah, Niru. That look again... It's rude, you know.  
  
Well, it's my fault that I've become a young lady who eats weeds… So,
from now on I'll act more Chloe-like. Of course, in a witch-like way.
