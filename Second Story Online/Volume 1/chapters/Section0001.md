# 1・Welcome to SSO

—For those seeking a second story.  
  
Villagers who till the fields and live their days to the fullest.  
A hero of hope who saves people.  
A terrifying monster that spreads fear.  
An absolute demon king with overwhelming power.  
  
An existence that you could only watch. An existence you never thought
you could become.  
Have you ever longed for such an existence?  
  
In this world, you can become anything.  
This world will make your dreams come true.  
  
Now, let your second story begin.  
A second story that is yours alone, no one else's.  
  
The story you weave will become the history of \[Second Story
Online\]――  
  
From the SSO tagline.  
  
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
  
Do you know the VRMMO called \[Second Story Online\]?  
  
You don't? …Well, that's understandable. I only learned about it from a
recent commercial.  
Unlike a few years ago, VR technology is not so unusual these days. In
this day and age, there are AR hologram billboards in the streets,
humanoid robots, and even space elevators.  
Among these, online games such as VRMMO seem to be quite common.  
Countless VR games exist worldwide, and the competition is so fierce
that many games have been forced to shut down.  
Apparently, things have calmed down now? …Sorry, I'm not really
up-to-date on recent game trends.  
  
Among all of this, a new service has been launched: \[Second Story
Online\].  
It's commonly known as \[SSO\].  
It's been a month since the game finished beta testing and launched, and
it’s a straightforward fantasy game. It was released by NR, a major
overseas game company that has produced many masterpieces in the past.  
  
Expectations were high, but… player feedback from the beta test was
lukewarm.  
And that hasn't changed a month after launch.  
People say that if you want to play a similar game, there are better VR
games available.  
  
And yet, I'm about to start playing this game.  
Why would I want to play such a game?  
――It's simple; I was captivated by SSO's charm.  
  
I was idly watching a TV program.  
I was watching a daytime variety show.  
Right after a summer beach segment, that SSO commercial aired.  
I've seen countless VR game commercials.  
So, I only registered it as "Oh, another new game" and almost forgot
about it… but that commercial stuck in my head.  
  
*'Villagers who till the fields and live their days to the fullest. A
hero of hope who saves people. A terrifying monster that spreads fear.
An absolute demon king with overwhelming power.'*  
  
The scenes changed rapidly with the narration, from citizens walking in
the city to someone walking outside the city with a sword in hand.  
Just when you think they're going outside and fighting monsters, the
camera starts following monsters instead of people.  
Then, it shifted to a presumed hero facing a presumed demon king.  
  
A hero raises their sword, a cleric heals wounds, a thief appears from
the shadows and strikes down enemies.  
  
*'An existence that you could only watch. An existence you never thought
you could become.*  
*Have you ever longed for such an existence?'*  
  
And then a magician showed off flashy magic.  
  
*'Now, let your second story begin. A second story that is yours alone,
no one else's. The story you weave will become the history of \[Second
Story Online\]'*  
  
At the end, the title and the words "Recruitment for new players for the
second period has begun" were left.  
The 30-second commercial ended quickly, moving on to the next one.  
  
After that, I moved quickly. I could have been mistaken for being
possessed; I opened SSO's website with lightning speed and clicked on
the recruitment application.  
And after passing the rigorous lottery (apparently, due to the
commercial's effect, regardless of reputation, applications exceeded the
limit), I'm about to log in to SSO.  
  
This isn't my first time with VR, but it's my first time playing a VR
game.  
No, when was the last time I even played a game?  
And yet, I'm about to play SSO, a poorly-reviewed game at that.  
  
I thought, "At my age, playing games now…" but I couldn't suppress the
feeling that welled up when I saw that commercial.  
  
Because the dream I'd held onto for years, my ideal, might be realized
in this game… because I might be able to become my ideal witch.  
  
Yes, I want to be a witch.  
In fairy tales, they're often the villains or supporting characters who
help the protagonist.  
But witches are witches, regardless of their role. I’ve always held a
certain admiration for these women.  
So when I heard that, I thought this was a good opportunity. And a good
way to kill time, too.  
  
There seems to be a one-month gap between the early access players and
me, but I'm not a serious player.  
I have only one goal: to fulfill the dream I'd long forgotten — to
become a witch.
