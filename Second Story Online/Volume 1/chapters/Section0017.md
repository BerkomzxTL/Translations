# 17・Witch and Knight

"Chloe-san. We accepted a request to hunt thirty goblins, right?"  
"Yes, that's right. We definitely accepted it."  
  
The plains, with Berry Village visible in the distance. A light,
seemingly from Kyle-san's light magic, illuminates the two of us. It's
like a spotlight.  
  
"I thought this request would take quite a while."  
"Yes, I thought so too."  
"So then, what are these goblin corpses in front of us?"  
  
Outside the light… the darkness is littered with goblin corpses. They're
gradually turning into particles of light and disappearing.  
  
"What are you talking about? Kyle-san lured them together… and this is
the result of me casting a spell on that group."  
  
Goblins scattered all over the plains. They have a habit of attacking
anyone they find hostile, so Kyle-san was running around the plains as a
decoy just a moment ago.  
  
And it was only a few seconds ago that I unleashed my \[Dark Burst\] on
the gathered goblins.  
  
"I… seem to have underestimated Chloe-san's firepower."  
  
Kyle-san watched the disappearing goblins with a strained smile. The
quest is complete. Thank you for your hard work. I didn't expect it to
end so quickly either.  
  
At first, we were doing it normally. But… Kyle-san is a shield, isn't
he? I'm grateful that he can take all the enemy's attacks, but the end
will come before that. With my magic.  
  
It was I who suggested we do it all at once instead of little by little.
Kyle-san said he'd be the bait, and that was the end of the goblins'
luck. The goblins on the plains were wiped out in minutes.  
  
"Even though I was partly to blame… I guess it was a bit different from
my usual style."  
  
Saying this, Kyle-san dropped to one knee and closed his eyes. It's as
if he's offering a silent prayer for the goblins he just defeated.
Perhaps that's what they call chivalry. Well, I did use magic on the
group chasing the decoy, so that was a bit of a surprise attack. I also
have some thoughts about that too.  
  
"If there's a next time, let's do it properly."  
"Yes, that's right. Next time, we'll cast magic head-on."  
"Chloe-san… please stop the annihilation."  
  
Impossible. I'm a witch. If they're enemies, I'll deal with them
mercilessly and with overwhelming force.  
Witches have a sinister image, but the witch I aim to be is a little
different.  
  
However, it seems witches and knights don't get along. No, I knew they
didn't get along from the start. After all, witches are usually on the
villain's side. They're the ones the knights hunt down.  
  
"Now then, Chloe-san. Let's finish the other one too."  
"Yes…"  
  
The remaining quest is a request from the village chief: to find
medicinal herbs. It would be best to continue with this request.
However, the sky is beginning to lighten. Night is almost over.  
  
"Kyle-san, my abilities aren't fully effective unless it's night. If
it's alright, we can continue…"  
"Is that so? Hmm…"  
  
Kyle-san seemed a little worried for a moment, but then replied with a
smile.  
  
"If it's just gathering herbs, it'll end quickly… I'll protect you from
the orcs."  
  
That's reassuring. Since Kyle-san said it so confidently, let's do it.
So, we headed towards the forest near Berry Village.  
  
"…By the way, Kyle-san, why are you a knight?"  
  
I decided to ask him while we were on the move. It's also because I
wanted some reference for my role-play. Whether or not that came across,
Kyle-san answered with a bright, cheerful smile.  
  
"Ah, that's because my father was a fine knight in the Kingdom's Knights
Order. So, I'm doing this to help people and train to become like my
father."  
"I see. So, in the future, you'll join the Kingdom's Knights Order like
your father?"  
"Maybe… If a lord I should serve appears before me, I intend to devote
my all to them."  
  
Kyle-san said this as if he was really living in this world. I can't
imagine that he's actually like that inside though. Ah… I should stop
talking about the person behind the character. It's rude. But even so,
your acting skills are truly something I should learn from.  
  
"…Chloe-san, why are you here? Judging from the way you speak, you don't
seem to be from this country."  
"Well…"  
  
Now, why is Chloe here? I'd like to know that myself. Hmm, yes…  
  
"To achieve my dreams, perhaps. It was impossible to do so while staying
at home."  
  
I'll answer that way for now. If she were a noble, she probably wouldn't
be able to become the witch she yearns to be. This includes a bit of my
own thoughts, not just Chloe's.  
  
"I see… it seems there's some sort of reason behind it, so I won't press
further."  
  
Yes, certain details of my setting haven't been decided yet, so please
don't ask. I'll tell you eventually.  
  
While we were having that conversation, we arrived at the forest. It
doesn't have the ominous aura of the \[Twilight Forest\], but that
doesn't mean it's safe.  
  
"An orc. Chloe-san, leave this to me."  
  
We encountered an orc as soon as we entered. Kyle-san raised his shield
to protect me. The orc, noticing our presence, lumbered towards us with
a club in hand.  
  
"Chloe-san, I'm counting on you."  
"Yes, leave it to me."  
  
I began casting a spell. As soon as I started, the orc set its sights on
me. Depending on the monster, they will attack the one they perceive as
the greatest threat. It's called hate.  
  
"It's a knight's duty to protect a woman. I won't let you."  
  
Kyle-san cut in between us and slammed the shield he's holding against
the orc. A \[Shield Bash\]. The orc seems to have shifted its target to
Kyle-san. It swung its club at Kyle-san, but it's blocked by the shield
so there's no damage.  
  
In the meantime, my \[Shadow Arrow\] spell is complete. An arrow was
launched towards the orc. The orc's HP ended up reduced. The power is
weakened since it's not night. Kyle-san added an attack with his sword,
and with another \[Shadow Arrow\], we finally defeated the orc.  
  
"Orcs are strong after all… well, maybe what happened up until now was
just too abnormal."  
  
Probably the latter. Still, daytime combat is a refreshing experience
for me. I can see the enemies clearly because it's bright. Ah… this orc
looks a little scary. By the way, Niru fell asleep, so I can't see the
enemy's HP anymore. How inconvenient.  
  
In between fights with the orcs, I continued searching for the medicinal
herb. Using my appraisal skill, I found ordinary herbs for potions, and
because it had leveled up, I could also see some poisonous ones too.  
  
"Ah, there it is!"  
  
After fighting about three orcs, I finally found the herb requested by
the village chief. There was one that stood out as being a little
different from the others. After obtaining it, the quest advanced, so it
seemed to be the correct one.  
  
"We finished all the requests. Shall we head back... Chloe-san?"  
  
…This herb. I've never seen this shape before. It's not like the ones
shown on the walkthrough site. Is this a quest-exclusive item?...I'm a
bit curious, so I'll try eating it.  
  
"Chloe-san, what are you doing!?"  
"It's alright, I only ate a little."  
  
While calming the panicked Kyle-san, I used my \[Taste\] skill to check
the flavor. Hmm, it's surprisingly good… but—  
  
"…"  
  
An icon showed up in my peripheral vision. I stared at it unconsciously.
The flashing icon disappeared immediately, but I know what it is.  
  
"…Chloe-san?"  
"Kyle-san, this herb… seems to be a poisonous plant."  
  
The flashing icon indicated the poison status ailment. But I have poison
resistance, so I wasn't poisoned… but isn't it a little too strong? I
still took a bit of damage.  
  
…Village chief. What's the meaning of this?
