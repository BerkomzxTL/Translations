# 12・A Little Ninja Appears

Giving up on the search for the black cat, I went to the \[Twilight
Forest\] with Niru.  
  
It's still incredibly dark, even at the entrance. In the midst of this
darkness, I continued to pull up and eat grass.  
  
Niru is sleeping on a nearby branch. He seems more relaxed than usual.
Perhaps this place is like his hometown. But Niru seems to really love
sleeping. And eating. I'm worried he'll put on weight soon, so I'll have
to keep an eye on him as his master.  
  
Now, after repeatedly pulling up and eating grass, I've started to
recognize some plants with just a small bite. Sometimes I come across
poisonous or paralyzing grass, but that can't be helped.  
  
《A skill has been acquired through repetitive actions.》  
  
That system message appeared after I continued working for a while. I
wonder what skill I've acquired this time? Let's check it out.  
  
\[Appraisal: Plants\]\[Taste\]\[Gathering\]\[Night Vision\]\[Poison
Resistance\]\[Paralysis Resistance\]\[Sleep Resistance\]  
  
Quite a few skills appeared at once this time. The Appraisal skill is
particularly noteworthy. While it can be learned from a skill master, I
acquired it on my own. A language skill wasn't necessary. Or rather, it
was necessary, but...  
  
\[Gathering\] is probably because I've been pulling herbs out all this
time. These two skills should make searching for herbs much easier.
\[Night Vision\] finally appeared too. This will make nighttime
activities easier.  
  
The three resistance skills were also worth eating grass. I understand
that \[Taste\] appeared because I was checking the flavors. I plan to
get a Cooking skill eventually, so this is good.  
  
However, with so many skills appearing, I'm wondering whether to get
them all. I should think about the future, but... Ah, but they all seem
necessary. I currently have 11 basic skills. Remaining SP: 20. Each
skill costs 2 SP, so I need 14 SP to get them all. I can acquire all
7.  
  
The required SP for acquiring new skills increased when the number of
basic skills reached 10. It will probably increase again when it reaches
20. I should check a strategy guide later.  
  
"If I get the Cooking skill, that'll be 19 in total..."  
  
For now, the only other skill I want to get besides those listed is the
Cooking skill. But I also want one more magic spell, so if I add that
in, I'll have 20.  
  
For now, let's acquire only the necessary ones. So, \[Appraisal:
Plants\], \[Gathering\], and \[Night Vision\]. Total SP cost: 6.  
  
The previously dark area became much easier to see. And the plants,
which all looked like the same grass before, are gradually taking on the
shapes I've seen in strategy guide photos.  
  
"...I see. This is how they looked to other people."  
  
The plans identified as medicinal herbs have large leaves. And thanks to
\[Gathering\], I can collect more than usual.  
  
...Wait, something's wrong. There are no poisonous plants, paralyzing
plants, or sleep plants. I'm in the same location, so they should be
here, but I can't find them with the Appraisal skill.  
  
"...Could it be because of my Appraisal skill's level?"  
  
Apparently, at level 1, only medicinal herbs are identifiable. Since I
was searching without using the skill, I was able to find the others. I
want to collect those three types as well, but... that means I should
probably also get \[Taste\], \[Poison Resistance\], \[Paralysis
Resistance\], and \[Sleep Resistance\].  
  
"Ah, forget it! If I'm going to worry, I might as well get them all!"  
  
So I took them all. There was no planning involved.  
  
Gathering resumed. I picked herbs identifiable with Appraisal, and
occasionally tasted them. They all taste the same, but sometimes
slightly weaker or stronger. Oh, since I've acquired the resistances,
the herbs don't poison, paralyze, or put me to sleep.  
  
One strange thing was that the plants I ate contained a mixture of
different herbs. Herbs that should be identifiable with Appraisal. Yet
some herbs were still unidentifiable... What's going on?  
  
"I think this is enough gathering."  
  
Even though I thought that, the gathering went smoothly. 50 herbs
collected with Appraisal. 20 herbs collected by tasting. About 20 each
of poisonous, paralyzing, and sleep herbs. Combined with the ones from
last time, I have 30 poisonous herbs, and 25 each of paralyzing and
sleep herbs.  
Also, I managed to get 10 edible plants not related to herbs, and plant
seeds thanks to the \[Gathering\] skill.  
  
Incidentally, the related skills have also leveled up. Things are going
well.  
  
Now let's make some potions. I left the \[Twilight Forest\] and went to
the grasslands. Here, the enemies are mostly rabbits, so even if I'm
attacked during the brewing process, I can handle it.  
  
I heard that when doing this kind of crafting outdoors, it can only be
done inside an item like a tent. But thanks to the \[Camping\] effect, I
can do it even without such items. ...I guess it's more like outdoor
activities than strictly camping.  
  
Anyway, let's start making potions. It's a beginner's kit, so the mortar
and pot are small. If I want to mass-produce, I'll need larger tools.
For now, I can make up to five at once, so I'll get started.  
  
But it's strange. When I prepare the pot before the boiling process,
water appears out of nowhere. Game magic. I brought that water that
appeared from nowhere to a boil.  
Hmm, the taste does get bitter after simmering... Ah, I think I should
simmer it a little longer since it's five portions.  
  
\[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆\]×5  
  
Didn't the ones I made before have two stars? The performance is also
inferior to the ones I made before. Could this be...?  
  
I took out the herbs I had collected by taste to make a potion. I
crushed five of them in the same way and boiled them.  
  
But before that, there's something I want to check. The water that
appeared in the pot. I took a sip.  
  
"...It's not very tasty."  
  
Water. It's just water, you'd say. But what is it? It tastes somewhat
like bad city water. Well, recently the technology has improved, so no
matter where the water comes from, it's as delicious as natural spring
water. Anyway, just think of it as not very tasty water.  
  
"...The taste gets worse when boiled. Could the cause be the water?"  
  
Maybe it's not delicious because it's system-generated water. Maybe
that's why the potions taste bad. I'll try it next time.  
  
I was in the middle of making it. I hesitated a little, but there's no
other water. So I added the crushed herbs. And what I made was...  
  
\[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆☆\]×5  
  
Hmm... Apparently, the ones I tasted before collecting had better
performance. I tried eating the herbs collected using the Appraisal
skill. They seem a little less sweet. Now that I have the \[Taste\]
skill, I can tell even the slightest differences apart, but without it,
I might have treated them as weeds last time.  
  
"Because I kept the ones with stronger flavors, I ended up with good
herbs…"  
  
Due to the nature of the Appraisal skill, low-level appraisal only
identifies low-quality items. So the good quality herbs that I couldn't
appraise are still just weeds. This means I can't find good quality
herbs this way.  
  
"Maybe eating them was the right decision after all."  
  
I can identify them by taste. But people usually don't do that. Even I
wouldn't have tasted them if I had the Appraisal skill.  
  
Anyway, let's continue making potions for now. I'll turn the remaining
herbs into potions. And some good potions too. There were some failures,
but the production is complete. I ended up with \[Beginner Recovery
Potion: ☆\]×40 and \[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆☆\]×10.  
  
I thought I'd also make an antidote, but... failure. It seems I don't
have enough ingredients. I'll do that next time.  
  
"Phew"  
  
That's the end of this potion-making session. I moved around to loosen
my tired body. It's already dusk. Niru woke up yawning as if he had a
good night's sleep. Then Niru, who was sleeping on the ground nearby,
hopped onto my shoulder.  
  
"...That"  
"Whoa!"  
  
Suddenly, I heard a voice and was startled. I looked in the direction of
the voice and saw a girl. When did she get there? That was bad for my
heart.  
  
"That, owl. Yours, is it?"  
  
Is my language skill level too low? It's not translating properly. No,
the last "gozaru" should be as is. Because this kid is clearly dressed
like a ninja. That ninja girl is staring intently at Niru, who's on my
shoulder. Her eyes seem to be shining brightly.  
  
"Yes, it is."  
  
When I answered, she suddenly prostrated herself. Whoa, what's going
on!?  
  
"Please! To this one, owl, capture secret technique, teach!!"  
  
...What?
