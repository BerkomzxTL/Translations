# 36・Fluffy Yokai Are Scary

Well, what should I do today? After logging in, I was walking toward the
inn, thinking I should make some food first, when...  
  
"Eh?"  
  
Something fell from above. A black something collided with my face. I
felt a slight pain and a soft touch.  
  
"Meow!"  
  
I heard a cat's cry, and then my face was kicked by another black
something. That kick was painful yet soft. By the time my vision
returned, all I saw was a black cat running away.  
  
That was a black cat just now! Let's chase it quickly!  
  
"Wait for me, Black Cat-chan!"  
  
As I was about to chase it, another black something fell in front of me.
It was a person. Ah, this time it didn't fall on my face.  
  
"Ah, I missed the black cat again! I wanted to pet it!!"  
  
The one shouting was a girl in a black ninja outfit. A larger owl than
Niru landed beside her.  
  
"Tsubaki-san?"  
"Eh, ah, Chloe-san!? Why are you here?"  
"Um, Tsubaki-san, you seem a bit different than usual."  
  
I don't feel the usual coolness from Tsubaki-san. And she's not saying
"de gozaru."  
  
"...Ah, no! This is...ah, no, no, de gozaru!"  
  
Tsubaki-san's face was red and she was waving her hands frantically to
cover it up. Let's calm down first.  
  
"...I apologize. I seem to have lost my cool a bit."  
"Are you calm now?"  
"Yes…. Chloe-dono, what happened just now was the fault of a yokai. I
would appreciate it if you could pretend you didn't see it."  
"How frightening. Yokai are scary things."  
  
The uncool Tsubaki-san from earlier must have been possessed by a fluffy
yokai. Still, in her quest for the Mofu-mofu, she was chasing the black
cat at all costs...  
  
Jokes aside, I completely broke character earlier. For Tsubaki-san's
sake, let's pretend we didn't see that.  
  
...But it seems she can't give up on the black cat. Because she's been
looking in the direction the black cat ran off to for a while now. It
seems the influence of the fluffy yokai is still lingering.  
  
Well, I understand how she feels. It's run away from me many times, but
I just can't give up. If there was something that could make me give up
on that black cat, I probably would.  
Maybe I'm looking for that reason too, because I still don't know if the
cat is a stray or a pet.  
  
"Then I shall take my leave."  
"Wait, Tsubaki-san. Actually, I'm interested in that black cat. So,
could you help me catch it?"  
"I… um, yes. I shall help."  
  
She seemed hesitant, her body trembling slightly, but she nodded. She
likes black cats, huh.  
  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
  
Now then, let's start the black cat capture operation. This time, I have
a strong ally, Tsubaki-san. Moreover, she has Haku, her pet, and Haku
and Niru will search for the black cat from the sky.  
  
"Tsubaki-san, we've spotted a cat to the west of your position."  
"Understood."  
  
I can see Niru's field of vision. The cat seems to be around where Niru
is flying. I reported it to Tsubaki-san. Then, with ninja-like moves,
she hopped from rooftop to rooftop, towards the location. Amazing.  
  
"Alright, Earl. We're going too."  
  
Earl and I go from the ground. This place is a maze of narrow alleys, so
we'll probably arrive late.  
  
Niru and Haku arrived first, followed by Tsubaki-san. I'm staying up to
date on the situation through Niru's vision. The cat is apparently with
two men, and seems to feel at ease with them, getting its head petted.  
...When I get close, it usually runs away. I guess it doesn't like me
after all.  
  
"We've arrived. Now then, Tsubaki-san. Try approaching slowly."  
  
I contacted Tsubaki-san through party chat. Tsubaki-san tried to erase
her presence and approached the black cat. However, just before she
could reach it, the black cat sensed something and ran away.  
Did it sense Tsubaki-san's presence? If so, that black cat's ability to
sense danger is incredible.  
  
"Earl! I'll leave it to you!"  
  
We were hiding in the shadows, blocking the black cat's escape route.  
  
"Ouch!"  
  
In a flash, it jumped and stepped on my face again. I received the pain
and softness of its paw pads, and once again saw the cat running away.  
  
"Not again…"  
"Yes, indeed."  
  
While rubbing my cat-kicked face, I reunited with Tsubaki-san. We've had
Niru and Haku follow from the air, so we won't lose sight of it.  
  
I glanced at the men who were playing with the cat. They're both
good-looking enough that girls wouldn't stay quiet around them. Come to
think of it, that angler guy who was feeding fish to the cat was also a
cool, handsome middle-aged man.  
  
…No way. But, the cat that ran away from us is not running away from the
men.  
  
I wonder if that person is logged in right now. I opened my friends
list. This game is designed so that you can't see your friend's login
status, so you have to check it directly.  
  
*'Long time no see, are you free now? There's something I'd like to ask
you.'*  
  
Thinking of the person I wanted to talk to, I sent a private one-on-one
chat.  
  
*'Ah, it has been a while since we last met at Berry Village. If it's a
request, leave it to me, helping those in need is a knight's duty.'*  
  
I immediately heard a noble voice. It seems he's logged in.
