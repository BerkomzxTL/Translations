I managed to leave the Duo Region, but I'm struggling with the
language...  
  
121://Anonymous User 2  
\>120 I'm struggling too... What even \*is\* the Tessera Region's
language?  
The Duo Regional language was already tough enough  
  
125://Anonymous User 2  
I never thought I'd be hampered by language in a game.  
  
126://Anonymous User 2  
\>115 You're a guy from the Heiss Region! Hand over the princess!  
  
127://Anonymous User 2  
Fluffy sheep... fluffy...  
  
128://Anonymous User 2  
That's what you get with modern kids.  
  
135://Anonymous User 2  
I don't think I'll pass the entrance exam for the Royal Knights  
  
137://Anonymous User 2  
\>135 Let's become regional soldiers together. It's an easy job, just
stand in front of the gate and say the village name.  
  
138://Anonymous User 2  
I was petting fluffy sheep and somehow got the wrong thread. I'm
leaving.  
  
139://Anonymous User 2  
\>137 Seriously? Those weren't NPCs!?  
  
140://Anonymous User 2  
\>121 The Tessera Region's official language is the Holy Language, so if
you can speak that, you'll be fine  
  
144://Anonymous User 2  
Language and all that... I still can't get out of the \[Twilight
Forest\]. I keep getting killed by some weird white fog and monsters...
It's really a forest of the dead  
  
146://Anonymous User 2  
Was there any white fog?  
  
148://Anonymous User 2  
\>139 Those NPCs probably have that renowned, advanced AI from the old
models, and with so many role-players in this game... there's no way to
tell the difference  
  
150://Anonymous User 2  
\>138 I want a sheep! Fluffy fluffy!  
  
151://Anonymous User 2  
White fog and a forest? The \[Twilight Forest\] is dark  
  
155://Anonymous User 2  
Could it be a hidden area or dungeon...?  
  
  
  
///////////////  
  
  
"Okay, if I look like I'm about to fall, please catch me."  
  
Earl, who was standing under the tree, nodded in response to my words.  
...Please don't look up too much. You might see what's under my skirt.  
  
I'm currently in a plaza in Dairode Town. I've chosen a spot with trees,
for a certain reason.  
  
"Then, I'll go."  
  
I got on my broom, perched on a precarious branch. Niru, who's perched
on a nearby tree, is watching with disinterest, wondering what I'm
doing.  
  
What I'm trying to do is, of course, fly on a broom. I'm a witch, so I
have to fly on a broom. This is an essential skill for a witch. There
might be witches who don't fly on brooms, I suppose, but I'd prefer it
if they did. Because don't you think that's more wonderful?  
  
To fulfill that wish, or to uphold the general image of a witch, right
now, I'm—  
  
"Fly!!"  
  
I kicked off from the tree branch and leapt into the air. A moment of
weightlessness. But that's just from the momentum of the jump. After
that, I'm pulled down by gravity, fluttering down like falling leaves.  
  
Earl caught me as I fell ungracefully with the broom in my hand.  
  
"...You didn't see under my skirt, right?"  
  
Earl frantically shook his head from side to side. ...Next time, I'll
change my outfit. For today, I'll just have to make do.  
  
"Alright, let's try again. This time, I'll use wind magic."  
  
Earl is looking at me worriedly. Don't worry. I won't die from a fall
like this. Besides,  
  
"You'll catch me, right?"  
  
So, second attempt. Earl wanted to stop me, but he gave up. I climbed
back up the tree. This time, I cast the wind magic \[Air Shock\] and put
it on standby. I'm not equipped with a staff right now; I'm using a
broom. So my attack power is lower than when I have my staff equipped.  
  
However, what I need now isn't attack power.  
  
"Power of the wind, answer my prayers and lend me your strength."  
  
I also activated \[Wind Step\], wrapping wind around my body. It's a
spell that increases movement speed, but I want the wind's power more
than that effect.  
  
Flying in the sky with a broom in hand. It requires magic. It's possible
in this world. But it's impossible without the skill. Even if I know how
to fly on a broom using it, I don't know the spell to do it.  
  
I don't know, but actions sometimes lead to enlightenment. I think
that's how you acquire skills. A character's actions lead to the
character having an epiphany, or learning something, and that becomes a
skill.  
  
"Alright, this time, I'll fly."  
  
I kicked off from the branch and leapt into the air again. I unleashed
the \[Air Shock\] I had on standby onto the cobblestone ground, using
its force to propel me upwards.  
  
"...Whoa."  
  
I soared over the rooftops and the sky got closer. Below me, Dairode
Town spread across the grassland beneath my feet.  
  
"I'm flying...not!"  
  
Well, I just launched myself into the air with Air Shock. The wind just
slightly boosted the power of my kick. But I felt like I was flying with
the broom for a bit.  
  
"...That's the direction of the White Forest."  
  
Just before I fell, I glanced westward. That area seemed to be covered
in white fog that went all the way to the sky, making it difficult to
see the forest. I could only see a faint, transparent wall. It seemed to
be dome-shaped, preventing entry from above. I can see it because I
understand that wall exists.  
  
"Thank you, Earl."  
  
Afterwards, Earl caught me safely. At that height, I would have been
close to death, but falling from a great height and hitting the ground
is quite scary. It's not painful, it's scary.  
  
If I kept going, Chloe would probably get the hang of it. But I'll stop
for today. Even if it doesn't hurt, I don't want to be that scared. If
the time comes in the future to fly in the sky with a broom, I'll need
to overcome this fear.  
  
"I want to fly like Niru as soon as possible."  
  
Chloe doesn't seem to have any fear though.  
  
Now then, flying with a broom will be a future goal. Being a witch isn't
just about flying on a broom. Witches are also associated with
suspicious potions.  
  
First, let's make a normal healing potion. Not a beginner's one, mind
you. The ingredients for a regular potion are medicinal herbs and green
herbs. Thanks to leveling up my \[Appraisal: Plants\] skill, I can now
identify green herbs.  
  
I took out an intermediate alchemy kit. I ground the medicinal herbs and
green herbs in a large mortar. I used the \[Taste\] skill to determine
which ones had the better taste as well.  
  
I put them in a pot. The water was drawn from the town well. Stir the
pot as it simmers, and when the mixing time is up, it's done. I've made
a \[Delicious Healing Potion: ☆☆☆\]. It's hard to get above three-stars.
It's probably because I'm using plants that grow in the area, so no
matter how well I make it, the rank won't go up.  
  
Oh yeah, I'm using my Alchemy skill, but apparently the Cooking skill is
also going up. I guess the action of simmering in a pot is similar to
cooking.  
  
Let's also make a mana potion. The process is mostly the same. Grind the
magic herbs and blue roses together and simmer them. The result is a
\[Delicious Mana Potion: ☆☆\]. I used the best quality items I could
pick up, but I'm not sure if it's because of the difficulty or some
other reason, but I rarely get two stars and usually only one. I fail a
lot too. It seems like it could be because I'm not high enough level.  
  
Next, I'll make an antidote. Then I'll also make a paralysis cure and a
wake-up potion. Apparently I can make these too now. It seems you can
make them all by combining them with white herbs. White herbs are
amazing.  
  
That's it for potion making. Now, let's be more witch-like. Making
healing potions and antidotes is a given. But making poisons and potent
drugs is also something a witch would do. That's more the image I have
in mind, you know, poison apples and all that.  
  
Here's a plant called Lady Black. It's black and looks like a lady's
dress, with its frilly leaves. It seems to have the opposite effect of
white herbs. If white herbs encourage the cancellation of effects, this
one encourages the amplification of effects.  
  
When I simmer it with poisonous herbs, voila, the poison is complete. I
don't know what it tastes like, but I think it's probably coffee. The
Lady Black tasted like that. Let's also make \[Delicious Poison\] using
good quality water. Now I can secretly poison anyone I don't like.  
  
I won't, though. Chloe wouldn't poison anyone. If she were to do it,
she'd make sure to let the person know it was poison and then shove it
in their mouth. ...Okay, I'll do that sometime if I ever get the
chance.  
  
I also made paralysis and sleeping potions. But it's annoying that all
the effects are separate. So I'll take the poison, paralysis potion,
sleeping potion, and Lady Black, and put them all together.  
  
I remember seeing spider venom sacs in my inventory. Spider legs...
let's add those too. Deer meat and deer antlers... and mushrooms... I
also have goblin hair. Oh, and I still have bat wings.  
  
Halfway through, I started throwing in random things that caught my eye.
I'm cooking up something that's clearly dangerous. It's becoming a dark,
murky something. The smell is almost foul. It doesn't seem like a
failure... Could this actually be a success?  
  
As I was mixing, a puff of black smoke emerged. It seems to be done.  
  
\[Dark Soup: Whimsical, or perhaps deranged. A soup filled with the
malice of its creator. Eating it will make you experience the hell of
this world.\]  
  
...I was making medicine, but it turned into soup. My \[Cooking\] skill
went up, of course. I wonder what the hell of this world tastes like.
I'm curious.  
  
"Don't try to stop me, Earl. As the creator, I must confirm the effects
of this soup."  
  
Just as I was about to take a taste, Earl took the pot of soup from me.
Even if you shake your head that hard, I won't listen.  
  
I know it'll probably kill me if I drink it. So just a little! Just a
taste!  
  
Besides, I don't think it'll taste that bad. The taste system is
excellent. It can reproduce such tastes, but there seem to be
limitations. In other words, it's at a level humans can eat. So it
should be fine.  
  
"Earl, don't get in my way!"  
  
When I said it again, Earl stopped moving. He seemed to have frozen in
place, so I think the \[Command\] skill must have worked.  
  
"You're a good boy. Don't worry, I'll be the only one tasting this."  
  
While Earl doesn't look relieved at all, I scooped up some soup from the
pot he's holding. I took a sip with my spoon. Hmm...  
  
"...Hack!"  
  
The moment it touched my tongue, the flavor exploded. I can't describe
the taste. If I have to, it's a mix of bitterness, sourness, and
spiciness, like the gates of hell opened in my mouth. My tongue burns
and tingles, as if scorched by hellfire.  
  
I almost fainted, but I managed not to fall. I thought it would be fine
system-wise, but it's not at a level humans can eat; it's right on the
edge of what's safe for a human to consume.  
  
"That's... something..."  
  
My body wasn't moving properly. And my vision was becoming blurry, as if
I was drunk. When I looked at the edge of my vision, I saw abnormal
statuses.  
  
\[Poison\], \[Paralysis\], \[Sleep\], \[Stomach Ache\], \[High Fever\],
\[Weakening\], \[Weakness\], \[Slow\], \[Dizziness\], \[Eating and
Drinking are Ineffective\]... Wow.  
  
The poison, paralysis, and sleep effects are reduced thanks to my
resistance. But there's the persistent damage from stomach ache and high
fever, the stat reduction from weakening, and the decrease in maximum HP
from weakness. Plus slow, dizziness, and food ineffectiveness. My HP is
already low, and with ten negative statuses... the way my HP is
decreasing is extraordinary.  
  
But the effects disappeared in about two seconds. Probably because it
was only a spoonful.  
  
"That was close..."  
  
About 40% of my HP had disappeared in just two seconds. I was too
careless. I didn't expect it to be this bad... But I think it would be
good to use it on enemies.  
  
"It's very good. I'd like to do something about the taste though."  
  
If it's not for me, it might be fine the way it is.  
  
"What's wrong, Earl?"  
  
As I was thinking about how to use the soup and putting it away, Earl
approached me. He offered me the healing potion I had made earlier. I
hadn't recovered my HP yet.  
  
"It'll heal on its own eventually."  
  
I'm not in combat. It'll heal naturally soon.  
  
...Then Earl suddenly bowed his head. He quickly raised his head,
ignoring my words, and used the potion on me. My HP began to recover.  
  
"...Earl?"  
  
Earl bowed again as if apologizing. He's taller than me, so when he
bowed his head, our eyes met. He seems to be concerned about me.  
  
I can tell that he's worried about me, judging by his past actions.
Every time I try to do something dangerous, like flying off the tree on
my broom, or drinking that obviously dangerous soup, he tries to stop
me.  
  
...Now that I think about it, my actions have all been reckless. I was
so focused on playing the witch role that I didn't think about it. I
think it's because I was playing it as a game. Since this is a game, I
thought...  
  
"...I'm sorry, I caused you worry."  
  
But Earl probably doesn't think that way. This isn't a game for him. His
concern is genuine.  
  
"Thank you for the potion."  
  
The roles have been reversed, haven't they? Earl smiled, looking
relieved. He's an orc, so it's hard to call his smile cute, but I found
it a little charming.  
  
"But I won't stop doing reckless things. Please support me as my
servant."  
  
So I gave him a big smile in return. I just responded with role-play as
a person living in this world.  
  
Even so, Earl and the other NPCs all act very human-like. That rumor
about them using AI from old support robots might be true. I'll ask that
kid about it next time.  
  
Would that kid play this game too? That's something to look forward to.
