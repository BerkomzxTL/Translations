# 40・Hero-san, I’ll Give You a Holy Sword if You Help Me

Leaving Lucille-san's house, we arrived at the starting plaza. There are
quite a few people around. However, it seems like there are fewer
players than before. There are probably just fewer players who are
easily identifiable by appearance, and some people have just blended
in.  
  
I have to find that boy I met before from among these people.  
  
"Even if we search, we don't know his face, so we can only rely on
Chloe-san and Lucille-san."  
"That's true... Isn't there an easier way? Like, shouting if someone
recognizes this sword?"  
  
I'm sure he's looking for this sword.  
  
"You'd better not."  
“Oh, why is that, Tsubaki-san?”  
  
Tsubaki-san seemed to be against this plan. Even if he's not here, it
wouldn't hurt to try, though.  
  
*‘…I also object to that plan.'*  
“Lucille-san too? Why?”  
  
Lucille-san's voice came through her familiar, the black cat. She
apparently can't leave her house due to circumstances. She wouldn't tell
me the reason.  
  
*‘Just don't do it. It'll get you into trouble. I don't have time for
that.'*  
  
The way she said it was quite forceful. Even if I asked, she probably
wouldn't tell me the reason anyway.  
  
“Well, if he's not in this place, it's useless to shout no matter what.
Let's stop messing around… Niru, please.”  
  
Niru nodded and leapt into the air. By sharing his vision, I can search
the entire town. There's no need to split up.  
  
The problem is whether that boy is even here. If he's not logged into
the game, even if he's in this town, we can't do anything.  
  
“I found him!”  
  
Good. It seems he was logged in. I could see him leaving through the
east gate.  
  
“Tsubaki-san, please chase him. Niru will guide you!”  
“Understood.”  
  
Tsubaki-san disappeared in an instant. We'll leave the pursuit to
Tsubaki-san, who is fast on her feet. We'll follow her.  
  
Following Tsubaki-san, we went out through the east gate. In the
grassland, I saw the boy from that time and Tsubaki-san.  
  
“Tsubaki-san! Thank you for stopping him!”  
“Whoa! You're the one from before?!”  
  
The moment he saw me, the boy glared at me with hostility. Well, it
can't be helped.  
  
“…Long time no see.”  
“Long time no see, my foot! You stole my sword, give it back!!”  
  
Saying that, the boy drew his sword and immediately attacked.  
  
“Wait, please listen to what I have to say first!”  
  
Kyle-san immediately stepped in and protected me with his shield.  
  
“You must be her accomplice. You're all here to kill me, a hero!”  
“We are allies, but we didn't come to attack you. Please calm down. We
didn't come to fight.”  
“I don't trust you.”  
  
The boy still wouldn't listen. I'm partly responsible, though.  
  
“…I apologize for what happened before. As proof, I've come to return
your sword.”  
“Ah, my sword!”  
  
I showed the boy the sword and threw it to him.  
The boy, who hastily caught it, looked at me suspiciously.  
  
“Will this make you trust us a little?”  
“…What are you trying to do?”  
  
For now, the boy calmed down. Now we can finally talk.  
  
“We want to defeat the Red Beast. To do that, we need your strength as a
hero. Will you lend us a hand?”  
“That's awfully sudden.”  
  
Kyle-san put his hands on the boy's shoulders and pleaded desperately.
The boy looked slightly bewildered by his earnestness.  
  
“It's a sudden request, I know. It's understandable that you wouldn't
readily accept this from strangers. But, that Red Beast is contaminated
with Chaos and is dangerous. We need to take action before the damage
becomes greater. Only the power of a hero can purify the Chaos… that's
why we need your power.”  
“Okay, okay! I'll help!”  
“Really?”  
“Really! At least I trust you! Now let go of my shoulders!”  
“Thank you! This is a big help!”  
  
Kyle-san smiled happily, releasing the boy's shoulders.  
  
“…I understand the situation now. If you need my power, I guess I can't
refuse!”  
  
Was he happy to be asked to use his power as a hero? The boy puffed out
his chest proudly. Isn't he a little too cocky?  
  
“But before I help… I want an apology from those two!”  
  
He pointed sharply at me and Tsubaki-san. Wait, Tsubaki-san too?  
  
“An apology…?”  
“They killed me. The witch there killed me when I was trying to save her
from an orc.”  
  
Kyle-san looked at us with a confused expression. We're about to become
teammates to take on requests together. We can't handle requests in this
state. We need to clear up the misunderstandings.  
  
“…First of all, there's a misunderstanding. I wasn't being attacked; I
was just talking with my companion. You suddenly attacked me, and I was
merely defending myself. I apologize for accidentally knocking you
down.”  
“Then why did you steal my sword?!”  
“I just picked up the sword that was on the ground. Besides, I just
returned it to you. …Actually, you should be the one thanking me for
finding it and apologizing for attacking me in a misunderstanding.
Right, Earl?”  
  
I smiled at Earl behind me. Earl had been standing behind me for a
while, probably because he was scared of the boy. The boy seemed
surprised, as if he had just noticed Earl's presence.  
  
“…Hmm. Judging from the story, you're also at fault for attacking
first.”  
“Wh-what?! I'm at fault?! It can't be helped. I had no choice. I
wouldn't think of an Orc as an ally.”  
“Even if it was a misunderstanding, you still attacked. I think
Chloe-san went a bit overboard even for self-defense, but she already
apologized. So, shouldn't you apologize too?”  
“Ugh…but I…”  
“If you're admitting your mistake, you should apologize now. If you put
it off, it'll become harder and harder to apologize.”  
“…O-okay! I'll apologize!”  
  
The boy took a deep breath to suppress his irritation. Then, he turned
to me and Earl.  
  
“…I'm sorry. I attacked you…. And thank you for returning my sword… Is
this okay?”  
“Your apology is a little lacking, but it's fine.”  
“What's with that condescending attitude after someone apologizes!”  
  
I know my tone was bad. It's because I'm role-playing. I can't help
it.  
The boy, who apologized properly, is surprisingly honest. He would be
even better if he were a little more honest.  
  
“What, there's no need to bow down.”  
  
Earl approached the boy, bowing his head in apology for my attitude and
to thank him.  
Earl turned away from the boy, looking a little embarrassed.  
  
“…Now then, it's Tsubaki-san's turn. Tsubaki-san, you've met him before,
haven't you?”  
  
Everyone's gaze turned to Tsubaki-san. She stood with her arms crossed,
receiving their gaze with a serious expression.  
  
“This guy killed me from behind. I didn't even have time to resist.”  
“Tsubaki-san, if you have a reason, tell us, okay?”  
  
Upon hearing Kyle-san's words, Tsubaki-san's mouth slowly opened.  
  
“…I can't tell you the reason.”  
“Wh-what's that supposed to mean?!”  
“Wait, calm down!”  
  
The boy almost lunged at Tsubaki-san, but Kyle-san quickly stepped in
and stopped him.  
  
“So you have a reason you can't tell us.”  
  
She didn't respond to my words. I guess that's her answer.  
  
“But I won't harm you now. I want you to believe that.”  
“How can I believe someone who won't give a reason or an apology?!”  
  
That's certainly true. I can't trust Tsubaki-san right now. Having seen
Tsubaki-san before, I think she's alright. But she was just possessed by
a youkai. The current ‘Tsubaki-san' is her true self. If I look at that
alone, I wouldn't be able to trust her either.  
  
“I believe you.”  
“Huh?! Are you serious?!”  
“Of course, I'm serious.”  
  
Kyle-san smiled at Tsubaki-san without any doubt.  
  
“What's your basis for saying that?”  
“To put it bluntly, I don't have one. But I want to believe her words
that she wants me to believe her.”  
  
Kyle-san looked dazzling for a moment. Even if betrayed, he probably
wouldn't get angry at her. Seriously, why isn't Kyle-san the hero?  
  
“I still don't believe you!”  
“…Neither do I. For now, I'll trust you because Kyle-san does.”  
“You too…? Ah, never mind. But I'll make you apologize someday!”  
  
The boy pointed sharply at Tsubaki-san, but she cooly ignored him.  
  
*‘The matter seems to have been settled.'*  
“Whoa! The cat talked?!”  
*‘Don't be so surprised. I'm Lucille. I'm the one who requested them to
defeat the Red Beast. I'm formally requesting you to defeat the Red
Beast as well. By the way, what's your name?'*  
  
Come to think of it, I didn't know this boy's name. When asked his name,
the boy puffed out his chest and answered as if he was pleased to be
asked.  
  
“My name is Light! Yes, I'm Light, the hero chosen to save this world… a
great being who will one day leave his name in history. Remember that
well!”  
  
He drew his greatsword, Rex, as if to show it off. The sword, which came
out of its sheath without any resistance, glittered in the sunlight. Ah,
so heroes really do exist. The moment he drew his sword, I couldn't help
but think that.  
  
*‘I can't believe I'm doing this…'*  
‘Well, well. Thank you for stepping in. Thanks to Kyle-san, we were able
to get Light-san on our side.'  
  
A tired voice was heard, and I looked at Kyle-san. He still looked like
a refreshing young man who could have come straight out of a picture
book. But I thought I could see a slight look of fatigue beneath his
mask.  
  
*‘You say that, but there are still some things I'm worried about.'*  
  
Kyle-san shifted his gaze slightly. Following his gaze, I saw
Tsubaki-san, as I expected.  
  
*‘I don't know what she's thinking… but let's put it aside for now.'*  
*‘Right. If she does anything, I'll hit her with a spell, so don't
worry.'*  
*‘Haha, Chloe-san is really reliable.'*  
  
He said so with a slightly strained smile. After complaining, he was
about to end the conversation and go back to his usual self when he
yawned sleepily.  
  
*‘Are you sleepy?'*  
*‘A little. But I won't fall asleep. Speaking of which, are you okay? If
we continue with this request, it'll probably take several hours.'*  
*‘I'm still okay, and I have enough time.'*  
*‘Then it's those two…'*  
  
Kyle-san subtly asked those two in role-play. Those two are also
players. They have real-life things to do. They can't play forever.  
  
“I'm fine.”  
“I am… fine.”  
  
Tsubaki-san hesitated slightly before answering, but both of them seem
to be fine.  
  
“Light-san, is something wrong?”  
  
I felt a gaze and looked over. Light-san was staring intently at me.  
  
"No, well, Chloe's words aren't translating well, and sometimes they
sound strange...Is it a malfunction of the translation system?"  
  
He was moving his hands in the air, as if he were opening a menu and
operating something. It's probably not a malfunction.  
  
“…I can't quite understand your words, but you're saying that there's
something weird in what I'm saying. I only recently learned to speak
this language, so my words might sound strange.”  
“Oh, is that so? So it's related to language skills… If it was really a
malfunction, it wouldn't be funny, but it's only happening with Chloe,
so it's not a malfunction, is it…?”  
  
Halfway through, Light-san started muttering to himself. I think it's
just a matter of language skills, though. I still have trouble
understanding other people's words sometimes. It's gotten much better
recently, but it's not perfect yet.  
  
Speaking of Light-san, he seems like a role-player, but he's more normal
than other players. I guess he's someone who only role-plays when
necessary.
