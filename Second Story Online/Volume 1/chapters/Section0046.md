# 46・Let's Talk As Players

"Chloe, I've been waiting for you."  
  
When I left Lucille-san's house, I found Kyle-san, whom I thought had
already left. No, it wasn't just Kyle-san. Light-san and Tsubaki-san
were there too.  
  
《You received a party invitation from Kyle. Will you join the
party?》  
  
A sudden party invitation. I didn't know what it was, but I joined
anyway. Light-san and the others were already in, so we were once again
a four-person party.  
  
"Everyone, sorry for stopping you. I just wanted to talk about
something."  
  
Kyle-san started talking in the party chat. Judging from the way he
spoke, he wasn't role-playing.  
  
"What I want to talk about is the epic quest. It might not be necessary
to ask, but I'm curious. Are you guys planning to upload a video?"  
  
Come to think of it, we didn't upload a video of the last epic quest at
Kyle-san's request.  
  
"Surely you're not going to tell us not to upload one again?"  
"No, that's not it. I forgot to mention, but I intend to upload it."  
  
So he plans to upload one this time.  
  
"I intend to upload one as well."  
  
I don't have any problem uploading it either. In fact, I'd like to. Even
though I died midway through this time…  
  
"……I've already decided to upload."  
  
Tsubaki-san spoke in a small voice. Since we'd been interacting through
role-playing until now, she seemed embarrassed to speak without it.
Still, Tsubaki-san had already made her decision.  
  
"……Hmm. I was just told about it, so I don't quite understand, but I
guess I'll upload. After all, my awesome performance will be in it,
right?"  
  
He did have an impressive performance. Though it felt like a powerful
performance based on his character's abilities as a hero. Anyway, he
seems happy, so that's fine.  
  
"Then, as long as that flashy bunch doesn't refuse, it'll go up…"  
  
That's right. They were also players. Those who were present would also
be considered participants in the epic quest. I think the condition for
uploading the video is that a majority of those who appeared give their
permission. There are eight of them, so if everyone refuses, the video
won't be uploaded.  
  
"Ah, that's impossible because I blew them away…"  
  
From the perspective of someone who lost, that scene is something they
wouldn't want others to see… What a waste of my awesome performance…  
  
"Blown away… What did you do?"  
"I have a recording, want to see it? It's amazing!"  
"Why are you recording me without my permission, Kyle-san!? …Give me
that recording later."  
  
I mean, it was my amazing performance, after all. Of course I want to
save it.  
  
"I have one more thing to say. It seems us coming together is like fate,
so let's all have an after-party, shall we?"  
"An after-party…?"  
"In-game, of course. It could be us players, or between Kyle and the
other characters."  
  
That sounds interesting.  
  
"Sure, let's have an after-party."  
"……I don't mind either."  
  
Tsubaki-san seems enthusiastic too. It's up to Light-san now…  
  
"I'm fine with that too… but before that!"  
  
Light-san pointed sharply at Tsubaki-san. …Ah, this is unexpected.  
  
"You! You still haven't apologized to me! I won't let you participate in
the after-party unless you apologize!"  
"Huh!?"  
  
As I thought, he still holds a grudge. Tsubaki-san was flustered and at
a loss. If it were 'Tsubaki-san' the character, she would have kept a
cool poker face.  
  
"Hey, hey, don't bring character issues into this. We're talking as
players now."  
"But…"  
"But nothing. You're not stupid, you should understand that much,
right?"  
  
Light-san was speechless. He probably knew it, I guess. The fact that he
couldn't control himself shows that he's still a child.  
  
It was Tsubaki-san who attacked Light-san, that's true. But that was
'Tsubaki-san' the character, not 'Tsubaki-san' the player.  
  
Tsubaki-san acted the way she did, but there must have been a reason.
She merely acted according to that reason.  
  
"……Um, Light-kun's right. I'm really sorry for suddenly attacking you
the other day!"  
  
Suddenly, Tsubaki-san did a full-fledged dogeza (prostration).  
  
"Even though Tsubaki had no choice but to attack Light-kun, I'm really
sorry! I felt a bit guilty too. I wanted to apologize, but I couldn't as
Tsubaki."  
"Eh, wait a minute… why the dogeza, no, more than that, your way of
speaking, or rather your character, is completely different!?"  
  
That's understandable. That just shows how perfect Tsubaki-san's
role-playing was until now.  
  
"I'm sorry, Light-kun… can you forgive me?"  
  
Tsubaki-san, still in dogeza, raised her head slightly. She looked up at
Light-san with puppy-dog eyes.  
  
"O-okay! I forgive you! I forgive you, so you don't have to kneel down
anymore!"  
  
The atmosphere changed completely from his earlier stance of refusing to
forgive her. Light-san frantically repeated that he forgave her. It's
unclear who's apologizing now. Light-san, aren't you a bit too easy to
please?  
  
"If a beautiful girl does a dogeza, you'd have to forgive her, right?
Don't you think so?"  
"Why are you asking me for my agreement?"  
  
I nodded repeatedly at Kyle-san, then spoke up. I understand your point,
but why did you ask me?  
  
"Light-kun! Thank… you…"  
"Eh, hey!"  
  
Tsubaki-san, trying to get up from the dogeza, fell over. Light-san
caught her.  
  
"Hey, what's wrong?"  
"…………Shh"  
  
Even after I shook her shoulders, Tsubaki-san didn't respond. She had
her eyes closed and was breathing heavily. It was obvious from the looks
of it that...  
  
"She fell asleep."  
"It seems so."  
  
After a while, Tsubaki-san disappeared. Probably she was forced to log
out because she fell asleep. Because Tsubaki-san logged out, Haku, who
was next to her, also disappeared.  
  
"It's already past midnight for me too… No wonder I'm sleepy."  
  
Kyle-san yawned loudly, looking up, as if he was looking at the time
displayed on the edge of the screen.  
  
"Let's have the after-party another time. I'm going to log out before I
fall asleep too."  
"Okay, so we're disbanding for today."  
  
The party disbanded, and Kyle-san left. Light-san and I watched him
go.  
  
"Well, I guess I'll level up… What's this? Geh, a notification from mom…
Ugh, it's already dinner time!? Sorry, I'm logging out too!"  
  
Light-san, looking flustered, logged out without much of a farewell.  
  
I suddenly wondered about the time myself and checked the clock. It
seems I'd been playing with them for about three hours. The time I set
in real life always shows my bedtime. It wasn't past midnight like
Tsubaki-san and Kyle-san, nor early evening like Light-san.  
  
Incidentally, it's early morning in the game. The sunrise is very
bright.  
  
"My sense of time is all messed up…"  
  
One thing came to mind from my conversation with them. I hadn't really
realized it because I rarely interacted with other players, but this
game has global servers. Technological advancements are amazing.
