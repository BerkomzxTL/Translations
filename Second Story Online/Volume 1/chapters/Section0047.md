# 47・Let's Celebrate With Soba Noodles

"...Alright then, let's start the celebration for completing the
quest!"  
  
Kyle-san said, holding a teacup, looking a little formal. Since it's
party chat, he isn't role-playing, but his mannerisms are still the same
as Kyle-san's. So it feels a little strange.  
  
"Everyone, congratulations on completing the epic quest!"  
"Thank you for your hard work!"  
  
Everyone used their teacups as glasses and quietly toasted. The tea
inside, with a flavor like buckwheat tea, swayed, releasing its aroma.  
  
"Why is the celebration venue a soba noodle restaurant...?"  
  
Light-san sighed, looking at his teacup and the table.  
  
On the table surrounded by everyone was a Japanese dish called zaru
soba. But this isn't Japan. This is a soba noodle restaurant in Dairode
town. Why a soba restaurant is here is a mystery, but here it is.
Probably the owner's hobby.  
  
"Let's choose a place where we can really celebrate! Somewhere with
meat, you know! Why such a boring place!?"  
"Light-san, please be quiet. You're disturbing other customers."  
"Quiet? It's just a party chat so no one can hear it!"  
  
Mixed with Light-san's shouting, a wind chime tinkled faintly in the
distance. The old-fashioned interior of the store was filled with
customers with looks that didn't seem to fit in. Tsubaki-san was the
only one who seemed to blend in.  
  
"It was my request... do you hate it?"  
  
Tsubaki-san asked in a slightly downcast voice. Incidentally, she looks
as cool as ever. That cool Tsubaki-san repeatedly tried to pick up the
soba noodles with chopsticks, only to drop them. Again and again, she
attempted to grab the noodles with a sullen expression. ...Outwardly,
she seems like the least likely to struggle with chopsticks.  
  
"It's not like I don't like it or anything... Ah, whatever."  
  
Light-san, as if he didn't care anymore, grabbed the soba noodles
roughly with his chopsticks, dipped them in the noodle sauce, and
slurped them up. Then he muttered quietly that it was delicious.  
  
Tsubaki-san watched him enviously. Afterwards, she carefully lifted the
soba noodles, referencing Light-san's chopstick technique.  
  
"I chose it because I like soba."  
  
Kyle-san, saying this, was twirling the soba noodles with a fork, eating
them like pasta. About half the people in the restaurant were eating in
a similar way.  
  
"I didn't object either. And I did ask if this place was okay."  
  
I was also eating soba with a fork. I can use chopsticks, but Chloe
can't. By the way, Niru, Earl, and Haku are also here.  
  
Niru had already finished eating and was asleep on Earl's shoulder. Oh
yeah, Tsubaki-san said that Haku, although of the same species, could
only eat pet food. Could it be that Niru can eat anything because he's a
familiar spirit?  
  
Earl was eating the soba noodles with a look of intense interest. For
Earl, human food itself seemed novel. Initially, he seemed confused
about using chopsticks, but now he was using them skillfully. He has
large, thick hands, but he's surprisingly dexterous.  
  
"Was it? Well, I was still sleepy..."  
  
Light-san scratched his head and looked away. After yesterday's
disbandment, it took a while for this group to get together.  
I had errands in the morning, so I couldn't log in until the afternoon.
Only Kyle-san was there at that point. Tsubaki-san came next, and
finally Light-san.  
  
"That's right, I'm so sorry for falling asleep yesterday—ouch!"  
  
Because she bowed her head too forcefully, Tsubaki-san hit her forehead
on the corner of the table. Pain settings are different for everyone,
but it shouldn't have hurt that much. However, she must have had it set
a little too high. She quickly returned to her cool self, but tears were
in her eyes and she had a red mark on her forehead.  
  
"You don't have to apologize. You didn't cause any trouble."  
  
Kyle-san's words made me nod. If this had been during a quest, it would
have put us in a difficult situation, but we're human too. There's
nothing we can do about real-life matters. Besides, the servers for this
game are the same all over the world, and when you take into account
time differences and such, it's just too much.  
  
Even though technology has advanced to the point where language barriers
can be overcome, there are still many challenges. Yes, in today's world,
languages can be translated in real-time. That's why we can communicate.
Although, initially, we couldn't communicate because of the game's
language... In a way, it's realistic.  
  
"Ahhhhh!?"  
"What is it, suddenly!?"  
  
Light-san's shout startled me. What happened?  
  
"Yesterday's! Look, the video of the epic quest is up on the history!"  
"No way!?"  
"It's true! Look!"  
  
Light-san made his screen window visible to us. On it was the history
list on the official website. There, indeed, was the event we
experienced yesterday, recorded not only in text but also as a video.  
  
"...Records are always kept, but I never thought they'd upload a
video..."  
"Does that mean they gave permission?"  
  
Let's try playing the video. The video started with us receiving the
request at Lucille-san's house, and it recorded the scene where we
defeated those gold-plated guys. I'm not the one to say it, but could
they really be okay with this footage being made public?  
  
"I don't know. But those guys weren't role-players. There's a
possibility they didn't know about this system. So, it's not that they
permitted it, but..."  
"They didn't vote... is that it?"  
  
That's possible. If their eight votes were invalidated, it would explain
why the video was uploaded. I didn't know about epic quests or the
history feature until I was told.  
  
"This is a key system of this game, but for some people, it might not
matter."  
  
Well, that's one of the reasons why the number of players isn't
increasing... Kyle-san continued. Indeed, this game seems to favor
role-players. That's why there are more role-players than in other
games, but it's also the reason why it's difficult to attract new
players.  
  
"I'd like to see the service continue for a while longer."  
"It's only been a month since it started."  
  
...I'm a little worried. I'm concerned about the future of this game.
Many games that were once touted as masterpieces have been shut down.
The fewer players there are, the shorter the game's lifespan becomes.  
  
Unlike offline games, online games are unplayable once the developers
shut down the service.  
  
"Hey, let's stop talking about that. It'll spoil the soba! Besides,
that's something for the developers to worry about."  
  
Light-san was angry. But I think this is his way of trying to lighten
the mood.  
  
"I think we'll be okay. It's run by NR, so I'm sure they'll do
something. Remember that VR movie event last year? It was amazing!"  
"Ah, that really was amazing."  
  
Come to think of it, that was a thing. It was even featured on the news.
A movie, or rather a theatrical performance closer in form, using VR
effects on a real-world city street as the setting. The movie was based
on a game developed by NR Corp, which was originally made into a movie
series. Tsubaki-san must be referring to that special event.  
  
"I couldn't see it in real-time because I couldn't get a ticket."  
"Chloe-san too? Me too. It's basically the same watching through a
device, but I really wanted to see it in real-time. Especially the
actors' performances!"  
"Exactly, exactly!"  
  
Nowadays, some actors don't show their faces. What we're doing now
(role-playing) is something that can be done in the film industry.
Therefore, there are also actors who specialize in acting as CG-created
avatar characters. What we do for fun, they do as a job.  
  
That event allowed you to see the performances of such people in real
time... but I lost the ticket war and didn't get to see it. I had no
choice but to rent it later and watch it.  
  
"I hope I can become a good actor like that someday."  
  
I think Tsubaki-san is a skilled role-player. Although she does
occasionally break character.  
  
The after-party ended after that. I never thought I'd be having these
kinds of conversations with so many different people. I really should
have started playing the game sooner. ...But if it hadn't been for SSO,
I probably wouldn't have met these people, so I'm glad I had this
opportunity.  
  
"Thank you very much today. Tsubaki, Light, Chloe."  
  
As we were getting ready to split up, we decided to say goodbye as our
characters too, so the usual Kyle-san said goodbye.  
  
"...Kyle-san, you're not using honorifics for anyone."  
"Oh, sorry. Did you mind?"  
"No, it's fine."  
  
I'll still use honorifics, though.  
I don't know what language Kyle-san is actually using, but he seems to
have stopped using honorifics. This translation system is full of
AI-based translations, so I don't really understand it.  
  
"If you need anything, please call me."  
"Oh, if you need a hero's strength, just say the word!"  
"Yes. I might call you, Kyle-san and Light-kun, if I need a hand."  
  
Light-kun, not to be outdone by Kyle-san, said this while holding his
sword in its scabbard. Seeing him like that, I can't help but call him
Light-kun. But it also feels more natural, so I'll call him that from
now on.  
  
"I should be taking my leave... but I have something I must do."  
"Tsubaki-san?"  
"Huh?"  
  
At that moment, Tsubaki-san moved. A gust of wind blew past, and in an
instant, she was on the roof across the street.  
  
"...Excuse me, but I'll be taking this greatsword, Rex."  
  
And in her hand, the beautifully decorated greatsword Rex shone
brilliantly in the sunlight. Haku was flying alongside her.  
  
"M-my sword!? Why? Give it back!"  
  
It seemed as if she had no intention of responding to Light-kun's voice,
as Tsubaki-san and Haku disappeared again in an instant.  
  
"Why did Tsubaki take my sword...? Why!? Wait! Aaaaaah!"  
"Light!"  
  
Light-kun ran off to chase after Tsubaki-san. Kyle-san unconsciously
took half a step forward.  
  
"I'll chase after Light. I'm also worried about Tsubaki... You—"  
"I don't intend to chase after them. I have other things to do."  
  
To be honest, I'm curious why Tsubaki-san stole Light-kun's sword.  
  
"Okay, then I'll go after Light!"  
"Yes, I'll leave those two to you."  
  
I saw off Kyle-san as he chased after Light-kun.

Don't think too deeply about the translation settings. If you think too
much about it, you'll end up with problems like first person and other
issues.
