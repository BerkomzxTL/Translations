# 14・Let's Be Careful About Wasting Money

"Welcome~"  
  
The shop owner of the general store greeted me in a slightly cute voice.
I waved back at her.  
  
"Are you here to sell something today?"  
  
Yes, that's right. I came to sell the \[Beginner Recovery Potions\] I
made. After parting ways with Tsubaki-san, I thought I'd go back into
the forest to gather more ingredients, but unfortunately, I have a real
life too. I'm planning to log out soon, so I'm reluctantly selling only
the potions I have now. I want to earn some money and get better
equipment as soon as possible.  
  
"...Chloe-chan, you understand what I'm saying, right? If so, can I ask
you something?"  
  
I remember the shopkeeper wanting to ask me something before. It seems
to be about that again this time. The translation was a bit iffy, but to
summarize, she seemed curious about my two-star potions.  
  
"Chloe-chan, you're still just starting out, right?"  
  
She's probably wondering how I can make two-star potions as a beginner.
The reason I can create those potions is because I can find high-quality
herbs regardless of my appraisal skill level. I'll just tell her that
for now. After hearing my answer, she said "Ah, I see," and seemed
convinced. She was a little surprised that I had been eating weeds,
though.  
  
"Even if you use high-quality herbs, they'll fail if the method is bad,
so Chloe-chan, you're really good at making them!"  
  
I somehow ended up being praised. According to the shopkeeper, the
difficulty increases with mass production. If you don't properly gauge
the simmering time, the performance decreases. It's probably because of
the effect of my \[Taste\] skill that I could judge whether to simmer it
a little more or not. It was a bit bitter, though, and my tongue felt
like it was going to die. Improving the taste is something I should do
sooner rather than later to make better potions.  
  
And here are the results of this sale:  
  
\[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆\] ×30 3300G  
\[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆☆\] ×10 1300G  
  
Total: 4600G  
  
As usual, I got a slightly higher price for them. She's a good
shopkeeper. I kept the remaining ten one-star potions for myself.  
  
By the way, the mushroom monster dropped some materials in the battle
just now. Mushrooms and mushroom spores. I was wondering whether to sell
these materials, but I decided to keep them because they seem useful for
alchemy. I'll keep materials that look like they could be used in
alchemy on hand in the future.  
  
Since I'm here, I'll take a look at some items. A mid-level alchemy kit
was selling for 2000G... What should I do? I need about 20,000 for
equipment. I'll hold off here... but if I buy this, I can make more
potions and faster than I can now. That way I can earn more money...  
  
...Before I knew it, I had bought it. It feels like I've done the same
thing as last time.  
But this will expand my range of alchemy. By the way, I was told that
I'd have to order the advanced ones from the Kingdom or go buy them
directly. I'll keep that in mind.  
  
My current cash is 5270G. ...Well, let's do our best.  
  
  
Going outside, it's already evening. It'll be night soon, so if I were
to go hunting, that would be fine, but I have to log out now. Before
that, I should have dinner with Niru. It's grilled meat skewers.  
  
"..."  
  
I still have leftovers from before. Saving money on food takes priority
over weight gain, so don't look at me like that, Niru. I received a
slightly cold look, but Niru kept eating. Does he really like eating
that much? Seeing that, I said something I had been thinking about.  
  
"I was wondering, did you contract with me because it's three meals a
day with naps included?"  
  
When I said that, Niru flinched. It was as if he was surprised that I
knew.  
  
"...Niru-san?"  
  
This time I gave him a cold look, but he ignored me and resumed eating.
I somehow understood why Niru agreed to the contract with me. He
probably thought that this familiar life would be easier than living in
the forest.  
  
Compared to when he was in the forest, he doesn't need to hunt and
secure food by himself. He doesn't have to be on guard while napping.
And most importantly, familiars don't fight. They support the summoner.
To put it bluntly, it's just a job of being by my side.  
  
"Well, that's a familiar's job, so I can't say anything..."  
  
Judging from his work so far, it's fine, but please continue to work
properly. Being a NEET is no good.  
  
...Speaking of work. I don't know if this counts as work, but Chloe was
supposed to be a viscount's daughter. If she hadn't run away from home,
would I have had money coming in immediately?  
I'm a little curious about how people who became purely nobles started
out...

\[An Elegant Tea Party for Nobles by Nobles: 20th cup of tea\]  
  
1://Anonymous Noble  
Well, hello there. Have some tea, for starters.  
Excuse me, but are you a noble?  
What's that? A commoner? Oh dear, we don't invite filthy commoners. Be
off with you.  
What nerve.  
Oh, is this an invitation? Oh, so you are a noble. Welcome to our tea
party.  
  
  
～～～～～～～～～  
  
180://Anonymous Second Person  
HAHAHAHAHA! Playing the villainous noble role is too much fun, LOL!  
  
181://Anonymous Second Person  
\>180 Hero, it's this one.  
  
182://Anonymous Second Person  
I'm no good at playing the villain, so I'm impressed.  
  
183://Anonymous Second Person  
\>181 Come, hero! Show me a perfect death!  
  
184://Anonymous Second Person  
What a pure and righteous example of a villain...  
  
185://Anonymous Second Person  
Pure...? Righteous...?  
  
186://Anonymous Second Person  
In a way, the most interesting moment for a villain is when he dies.  
  
187://Anonymous Second Person  
It smells more like small fry than villain...  
  
188://Anonymous Second Person  
Another poor harvest! At this rate, the food supplies in the territory
are going to be a problem!  
  
189://Anonymous Second Person  
On the other hand, there are also decent lords.  
  
195://Anonymous Second Person  
It's funny, I was intending to play the elegant noble, but I ended up
playing a territory management simulation.  
  
196://Anonymous Second Person  
Mine has a strategy simulation attached.  
  
198://Anonymous Second Person  
\>196 You must be a nobleman from somewhere in the Three Kingdoms of
Asura, good job!  
  
201://Anonymous Second Person  
Got a viscount's house. I'm a noble from today onwards!  
  
202://Anonymous Second Person  
\>201 A viscount's house is nice. Congratulations.  
  
203://Anonymous Second Person  
A viscount's house, huh? There are quite a few of those, right?  
  
204://Anonymous Second Person  
There are quite a lot of barons. I think I saw some counts the other
day.  
  
205://Anonymous Second Person  
\>202 Thanks. I apparently have an older sister, but she seems to have
run away from home, so I'm the next head of the family.  
  
206://Anonymous Second Person  
\>205 Is your older sister beautiful? Can I have her hand in marriage?  
  
207://Anonymous Second Person  
\>206 I don't know which country's noble you are, but I don't know what
my sister looks like. In fact, even my parents can't remember her
name...  
  
208://Anonymous Second Person  
\>207 That means your family erased her existence... She ran away, you
say. I have a younger sister, but nothing like that happened to her.
Well, she hasn't run away or anything...  
  
209://Anonymous Second Person  
\>208 Is your younger sister cute? Can I have her hand in marriage?  
  
210://Anonymous Second Person  
\>209 You're not getting my sister. Die.  
  
211://Anonymous Second Person  
Hero, there are two lolicon nobles here!
