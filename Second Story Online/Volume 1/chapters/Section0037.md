# 37・Black Cat Capture Operation: Confronting Yokai and Evil Spirits

"So, I was called here to catch a cat... is that right?"  
"That's right. I'm sorry for calling you out for something like this."  
"Don't say that! I'll help you with anything I can."  
  
The young knight, having heard the situation, replied with a bright
smile.  
  
*'――What the heck?! You sent me a private chat, and this is it…? Calling
me out for something like this...'*  
  
…Immediately, a private chat popped up. It was a voice filled with
displeasure, a stark contrast to the cheerful tone from earlier. Well, I
knew this would happen.  
  
*'Fufu, I'm sorry. You're the only handsome guy I know. The main reason
is that I thought you wouldn't turn me down, Kyle-san.'*  
*'Yes, that's right. There's no way Kyle would refuse.'*  
  
He glared at me for a moment in a way that only I could see. That
unbelievable sight of Kyle-san was before my eyes.  
  
*'Ah, Kyle-san is possessed by an evil spirit…'*  
*'Who's possessed?!'*  
  
You shouldn't make that face, it'll ruin your character, Kyle-san.  
  
I, of course, was the one who called him. To capture that black cat.
After contacting him, Kyle-san arrived immediately. I like his
gentlemanly nature of not keeping women waiting.  
  
*'Fine. By the way, who's that cute ninja girl and the big guy over
there?'*  
  
Kyle-san pointed to the two waiting a little distance away. He'll help
me, even though he's complaining. I'll quickly explain the two.  
  
“I'm surprised he's an orc.”  
“He's an orc, but he's a good kid. So please don't attack him.”  
“Of course, I wouldn't do that.”  
  
As expected of Kyle-san. Even knowing he's an orc, he doesn't attack
him, unlike a certain boy.  
  
*'…You made an orc your servant?'*  
*'It just happened.'*  
  
…Well, the "evil spirit" made fun of me about Earl.  
  
*'Well, I won't attack, but be careful of others.'*  
*'Thank you, Evil Spirit.'*  
*'Stop calling me that!'*  
*'Then, how about "guardian spirit"? '*  
*'Get away from the "spirit" thing!'*  
  
Let's leave the spirit conversation there. It's about time to introduce
Tsubaki-san.  
  
"Tsubaki-san. This is Kyle-san. He's here to help us catch the cat."  
"Hello, I'm Kyle. Pleased to meet you."  
  
Where did the Kyle-san who glared at me just now go? He was now sporting
a bright, shining smile, and holding out his hand as if to shake hands
with Tsubaki-san.  
  
“It's Tsubaki."  
  
Tsubaki-san only introduced herself simply with her name. She didn't
shake his hand. Even after being refused a handshake, Kyle-san
maintained his smile.  
  
Now then, with Kyle-san, let's resume the capture operation. Thanks to
Niru and the others, we know where the cat is now. We predicted where
the black cat would go next and moved there.  
  
"The black cat will be here soon, so please, Kyle-san!"  
  
An alleyway lined with houses. Kyle-san is in the middle of the road.
I'm hiding in the shadows of a nearby alley. Tsubaki-san is on the roof.
We're all in position, waiting for the black cat.  
  
"What should I do when the black cat comes? Should I just catch it?"  
"If you try to do that, you'll make it wary. Let's see… try to befriend
it and pick it up without arousing suspicion."  
  
Since Kyle-san isn't known to be our ally, the black cat will probably
let its guard down.  
  
"Befriend it… I'll try my best."  
"The black cat is coming. Now, do your best to woo it!"  
  
After finishing my conversation with Kyle-san, a black cat appeared from
the end of the road, swaying its tail.  
  
"Meow?"  
  
It stopped near Kyle-san and tilted its head as if looking up at him.
Kyle-san seemed to notice the black cat then, and looked at it.  
  
"Oh, hello there, Black Cat-san. Are you out for a stroll?"  
  
Kyle-san greeted the black cat with a bright smile.  
  
"Meow?"  
"Me? I'm waiting for someone here."  
  
Kyle-san naturally crouched down. Then he started stroking the cat's
head.  
  
"…Or maybe I'm mistaken? She never came after all."  
  
Kyle-san made a sad expression. The black cat rubbed against Kyle-san's
hand as if worried.  
  
"Meow"  
"Are you comforting me? Thank you."  
  
Kyle-san smiled and gently picked up the black cat.  
  
"Maybe the one I was waiting for was you."  
  
*'The young man smiled, his eyes slightly downcast. It was a fleeting
smile tinged with sadness.*  
*Who was that sadness directed towards? Seeing that smile, there's no
one who could just stand by and leave him alone.*  
*He was emotionally wounded, like an abandoned kitten...'*  
  
*'…Stop narrating! It's embarrassing!'*  
  
All I could hear was an angry voice, with his expression unchanged.  
I got scolded. I just went along with the guardian spirit's prank.  
  
"What are you doing, Kyle-san?"  
"Chloe-san told me to woo it, so I did."  
  
I came out of the alley and called him out on it. I said "woo it" as a
joke, but I didn't expect him to actually do it.  
  
"…I never imagined we'd catch it this way."  
  
Tsubaki-san jumped down from the roof and joined us. She stared intently
at the black cat in Kyle-san's arms.  
  
"So, what are you going to do with it now?"  
"Of course, make a contract with it as a familiar!"  
"Fluffy first!"  
  
Our voices overlapped. Then I made eye contact with Tsubaki-san next to
me.  
  
"Tsubaki-san. Please let me make a contract first. It's behaving for
now, but we don't know when it might run away. After we make the
contract, you can pet it all you want!"  
"What if the contract fails? I believe that the target's consent is
required to make it a familiar. if there's a chance the black cat might
run away, the contract will obviously fail."  
  
Tsubaki-san seems adamant about not giving in. As proof of this, she has
been possessed by the yokai mofu-mofu-san again. Is today the day when
everyone is possessed by something?  
We cooperated to catch the black cat, but I won't give in either.  
  
"...You two. Umm――You two, listen to me!"  
  
Kyle-san interrupted as we argued over who goes first, Tsubaki-san or
me.  
  
"What is this, both of you? What do you think the cat is? A soft
plushie, or an accessory to make you look like a witch?!"  
  
Indeed, Kyle-san is right. I was blinded by my desire to have a black
cat… I guess I was also possessed.  
  
Tsubaki-san bowed her head in apology.  
  
"I'm sorry, Kyle-san. I acted childishly, obsessed with becoming a
witch."  
"Sorry. It would have been impossible in real life... I got a little too
carried away."  
  
We both apologized. It's fine that we didn't do the role-playing, since
no one else is doing it either. It's times like these, after all.  
  
"Haa… really…"  
*'Now, now, don't be so angry. They've already apologized, so I think
that's enough.'*  
"But… wait, the cat talked!?"  
  
Suddenly, a voice was heard. It came from the cat Kyle-san is holding.
While everyone was surprised, the black cat jumped from Kyle-san's arms
to the ground.  
  
*'Kakaka, don't be so surprised. More than that, you chased after me
relentlessly. If you are truly sorry, I'd like you to at least grant my
wish.'*  
  
The door of the house behind the talking cat slowly opened. The black
cat went into the house. As if saying follow me, it wagged its tail.  
  
"…What do we do?"  
"What do we do… we follow that cat, of course."  
  
I replied to Kyle-san, who had returned to normal, and entered the
house. Earl followed me. Tsubaki-san followed behind him, entering
silently.  
  
"I guess I also bear some responsibility."  
  
Finally, Kyle-san entered the house.
