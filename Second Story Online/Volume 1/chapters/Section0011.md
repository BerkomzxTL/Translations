# 11ãƒ»Black Cat-san, Please Make A Contract With Me

In the end, I couldn't log in after that yesterday. I think that was
because I was talking to an acquaintance I hadn't seen in a while.  
  
Today, I finally logged into the game.  
I confirmed that my death penalty was completely gone. Now there are no
restrictions on my actions.  
Well, considering my skill build, I guess I'm still restricted from
acting outside of nighttime...  
  
Looking at the sky, the sun is high. It's probably best to avoid combat.
Ah, let me have lunch first. Before that, I'll summon Niru. Niru,
summoned again, got on my shoulder while looking a little sleepy. He
seems to like this position.  
  
"Hey there, young lady!"  
  
When I went to the market, the man at the stall greeted me cheerfully.
Yes, because I had acquired the language skills, I was able to
understand what he was saying.  
  
"...Konnichiha"  
  
Let me give a slightly broken greeting. I don't fully understand what
the old man is saying, but it seems he's asking if I've come to buy
lunch. What should I do? I was thinking of something other than grilled
meat skewers. I still have some that I received in my inventory. This is
troublesome.  
  
"A girl shouldn't eat meat skewers every day."  
  
A voice called out from the next stall over. A woman in a headband and
apron. Her stall had sandwiches lined up. She beckoned me over as if
inviting me to her stall. Gratefully, I head towards her. The old man
looked a little sad, but I understood why.  
I bought a sandwich from her stall. It looked delicious, full of
vegetables. I also asked her if there were any good armor shops nearby.
After chatting with the woman and the old man for a while, they showed
me a map and told me where to go.  
  
"Thank you."  
  
I thanked them with my clumsy words and said goodbye. I hope I can have
a proper conversation with them someday.  
  
  
I had lunch in the square and went to the armor shop they told me
about.  
  
The bell attached to the door chimed as it opened. A somewhat taciturn
man was tending the shop. There are no other customers besides me. I
walked around the shop, looking for armor that would fit me.  
  
This shop seems to handle only light armor and robes. As a mage, I'll
look at the robes. There are various shapes and performance levels, but
the better ones are expensive. If I were to buy all the equipment I
want, it would cost 10,000G. I don't have enough money.  
  
"...Ah"  
  
Th-this is a pointed hat! Isn't it a pointed hat? I want it! Wait,
10,000G? That's expensive!  
  
...Now I need to somehow get 20,000G. If I consider weapons, it'll
likely increase even more.  
  
"Welcome~"  
  
At the next general store I stopped by, I was greeted with a fluffy
voice. It's the shopkeeper who bought my potions at a high price. I
asked her if I could sell her the items I got from hunting goblins the
other day.  
  
"Yeah, sure~"  
  
The shopkeeper replied in a relaxed manner. Good. Ten goblin claws and
three rat tails. A total of 1040G. Since other players also hunt
monsters, easily obtainable materials seem to be traded at low prices.
Next time, I'll make some potions and come back to sell them.  
  
I currently have 3670G. Let's earn money slowly...  
  
It's not night yet, so let's go back to the forest to look for potion
ingredients.  
  
Just as I thought that and went out into the street...  
  
"Meow"  
  
I heard the sound of a cat coming from somewhere. Looking in that
direction, a black cat was looking at me.  
...A black cat. A black cat. Speaking of black cats, they're a classic
witch's familiar.  
  
"Ah, wait!"  
  
The cat ran off somewhere. I won't let it escape. A black cat is a
witch's status! I have to make a contract here no matter what! I
suddenly ran off, so Niru was surprised and flew away, but I can't pay
attention to him now. More importantly, the black cat!  
  
"Black Cat-san over there, please contract with me and become my
familiar!"  
  
But even though I chased after it desperately, I couldn't catch the
surprisingly fast black cat. It nimbly climbed a tall building and
escaped over the wall. I can't chase it like this. Ugh.  
  
"Someday...I will!"  
  
I'll make a contract with the black cat!  
I feel like Niru, who has returned, is giving me a somewhat exasperated
look, but I'm sure it's just my imagination.
