# 20・Where People Gather

Today, I was about to log in to SSO… but I forgot it was under
maintenance. What should I do? It looks like it will be over in about an
hour….  
  
By the way, Kyle-san told me the least I could do was check out the
official website's History. Since I'm here, let me look into that. It's
not good for someone who lives in this world to be ignorant of its
history. Moving to the world History from the official homepage.  
  
… I skimmed through it. I don't think I can remember all of this after
just one read.  
  
Well, to summarize, this world is apparently blessed by gods called Star
Gods, true to their name.  
  
Then, the Great Chaos appeared in such a world. Since the Chaos
appeared, the world has been in a terrible state.  
The Great Chaos itself was defeated by people who received the
protection of the Star Gods… but it wasn't a complete victory, it seems.
When it was defeated, the Chaos scattered across the world. The
scattered power of Chaos was somehow suppressed by sealing it in various
locations.  
  
Amidst all this, a second threat called the Chaos Dragon appeared, but
five heroes succeeded in defeating it, and several hundred years later,
we arrive at the present. —That's the gist of it.  
  
Well, more importantly, I found someone interesting in this story.  
One of the five heroes was a magician.  
  
An elf magician who may still be alive in the present day. And it's
described as if they became a hero simply because they were acting as
they pleased.  
  
—I observed the fate of those cursed by Chaos, and I defeated them
because it seemed interesting.  
  
That's what that magician supposedly said to one of the heroes.  
  
This seems like it could be useful. As a reason for Chloe being a witch…
or rather, why she uses magic. Also, as a reason for abandoning her
noble status. Chloe probably admired this magician.  
  
This mage who lived as they pleased, freely. What drove Chloe, who was
trying to live the life dictated to her as a noble, was the existence of
that hero… Okay, I'll go with this!  
  
The maintenance seems to be over. Let's log in right away.  
  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
  
I logged in and summoned Niru. Niru, as always, is opening and closing
his eyes sleepily while perched on my shoulder.  
  
"You're the same as always, Niru."  
  
Niru suddenly looked at me. He was staring intently. Please stop that
gaze. It's because of that gaze that he acquired the skill \[Cold
Gaze\].  
  
This is a skill of Niru's, which I didn't know about before. The effect
seems to be removing one effect from a target. If the opponent has buffs
that increase their stats, it will nullify those buffs.  
  
The other skill he acquired, \[Perception\], seems to be a skill to
discern hidden objects and invisible information. Looking back on Niru's
actions, whenever something happened, he would stare intently, so it's
probably a reflection of that behavior.  
  
But please don't stare at me. My buffs will disappear. Nothing is
applied to me right now, but I feel like the buffs protecting my mind
are being chipped away one by one. Or maybe I'll be exposed. What's
being exposed? The part of me that isn't Chloe. Do you know the saying,
“There's no one inside,” Niru? Somehow, I feel like it's too late for
Niru here...  
  
After a while, he closed his eyes as if falling asleep. …Why was he
looking at me like that?  
Suddenly, the edge of a hat catches my eye. Ah, is it because I changed
my equipment? Niru wasn't there last time I went to the armory. Maybe he
was looking at me because it's an unfamiliar outfit.  
  
"Niru, what do you think of my outfit?"  
"…………"  
  
Niru, please answer me instead of sleeping. Or does it not suit me? When
I asked that, he finally opened his eyes and looked at me. Then he
tilted his head. …Do owls have a sense of fashion? I unconsciously
tilted my head too. Asking Niru was a mistake.  
  
Incidentally, this pointed hat is much more expensive than other
equipment and its performance is far superior.  
  
\[Nica's Magician's Hat: Defense +20, Magic Defense +20, Max MP
Increase: A hat made for magicians. The distinctive silhouette is
designed to attract ambient magical power.\]  
  
My MP is slightly increasing. I'm glad. Nica's is probably the name of
that shop. The coat and mantle I bought together also have that name on
them. Ah, I got a new mantle, so the hooded black cloak I bought at the
beginning is in my inventory.  
  
All that's left is… a weapon. I couldn't help but stare at the staff in
my hand.  
  
I've finished buying new armor, but not my weapons yet. I want to
replace my staff with a new one too. When I went to the weapon shop, a
good looking staff cost 30,000G. I could have gotten a cheaper one, but
I fell in love with the design. I want that black staff… Ah, I need to
earn some money.  
  
Then, there's the retainers. I ended up buying a retainer contract.
Well, I can put that off for now. That means I need to prioritize
earning money for the staff.  
  
It's daytime now, so... well, I guess I'll just make some more potions
for now.  
  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
  
I arrived at the \[Twilight Forest\]. Somehow, it seems different from
the last time I was here. That's because there are many people entering
and leaving the forest entrance, and tents are set up, so it looks like
a temporary campsite. After doing some research, I found that the
average level of the second group of playertesters is around 20, and
that's when they'll surpass this forest.  
  
That's why there are so many players in this forest. At the forest
entrance, there are players recruiting party members to conquer the
forest, and players running repair shops. It's a place where people
gather, so it's suitable for business.  
  
Then, another party came out from the forest entrance. Everyone looked
injured.  
  
"Damn it, I never thought we'd run out of potions…"  
"We underestimated this forest… I'll go buy some potions in town."  
"Alright, I'm counting on you."  
  
I overheard that conversation. … I heard something good.  
  
Apparently, some parties were poorly prepared. I saw a few such people
around here and there. I have a feeling that I can make some money. Good
things come to those who hurry. Let's go into the forest to gather
ingredients for potions.  
  
As expected, there are more people in the forest than the last time I
was here. I can hear the sounds of battles coming from various places.
Since battles are happening around me, the number of monsters is
naturally decreasing. In other words, it's relatively safe to gather.
But my level is still only 16. For now, I'll just gather in the areas
I've been to before.  
  
The gathering was successful. Thanks to my improved Appraisal skill, I
can get medicinal herbs without having to taste them. I also found some
poison herbs and paralysis herbs. I haven't found any sleep herbs yet
though.  
  
By the way, I also did some gathering by tasting things, not just using
skills. There is a chance to get something better by tasting it  
  
"……This taste…"  
  
It was while I was selecting herbs by tasting them. This tingling herbal
taste. It's one of those often-gathered weeds with an unknown use. When
I tasted it, as if inspired, I opened the strategy site.  
  
There it was, Antidote Potion. The ingredients included poison herbs and
something called White Herbs. It seems that combining these ingredients
creates an Antidote Potion.  
  
First, I started gathering everything that tasted herbal. Then I
separated those with different tastes. Apparently, there are many types
of herbs, so different tastes mean different types.  
  
A large number of weeds lined up in my inventory. They are all sorted by
taste, so I have to be careful not to mix them up.  
  
Even if the taste is different, they are recognized as the same weed
item. This is probably because my Appraisal skill is still low. I
leveled up a bit with the selection just now, but it seems I still have
a long way to go.  
  
I stopped gathering and took out the alchemy kit from my inventory. I
have \[Camping\], so I can do production activities even in a forest
like this. Normally, I wouldn't be able to do this without returning to
town.  
  
I crushed the poison plants and herbs together. Of course, I made sure
to keep checking which herbs tasted the best. The first time was a
failure. The second time was also a failure. And on the third try—  
  
\[Antidote Potion\]  
  
I did it. Apparently, that mysterious herb with a mild, refreshing taste
was the White Herb. By the way, the water is that mysterious water that
comes out of nowhere. So, it won't taste good.  
  
I also tried making paralysis cures and sleep cures, but I kept failing.
Either I'm missing ingredients or my level is too low. Probably the
latter.  
  
For now, I'll mass-produce the recovery potions and antidote potions
that I can currently make. It's easy to boil with the intermediate kit
pot. Thanks to that, I was able to finish the work quickly.  
  
\[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆☆\] × 100  
\[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆☆☆\] × 30  
\[Antidote Potion\] × 25  
  
Now that I'm ready, let's go back to the forest entrance.
