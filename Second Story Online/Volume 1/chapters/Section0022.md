# 22・If It's Not Selling, Sell It Somewhere Else

One week has passed since the second batch of players started the game.
This also marks my first week playing SSO.  
  
The number of players in the \[Twilight Forest\] has increased even more
than before. Everyone's already at that level… or maybe I'm just
progressing slowly? Well, that's probably true. I prioritize real life,
so my daily playtime is probably less than other players.  
  
Anyway, rumor has it that the progress information for the \[Twilight
Forest\] isn't very good. Even the first batch of players struggled to
conquer it.  
  
Even with the information available, the situation remains the same…
apparently, the reason is getting lost in the forest. Many reports say
that they escaped after completing the forest map, and players theorize
that the forest map exploration rate might be the condition for escaping
the forest.  
  
Some people say they escaped even without a high exploration rate, but
those people were just lucky. It seems a reliable strategy is to use
items that efficiently increase your exploration rate.  
  
Well, I had a 100% exploration rate from the start, so I can easily get
out; I don't need those items. Thank you, \[Local Knowledge\]!  
  
Because of that, the entrance camp of the \[Twilight Forest\] is still
bustling. Potions are steadily supplied. Prices seem to have stabilized,
though they're still the cheapest here.  
  
Oh, that reminds me, in addition to HP recovery potions, I also saw an
MP recovery potion. As a witch who uses magic, I care more about MP than
HP, so I want to make this MP recovery potion. It seems I can make it
with my current \[Alchemy\] level, but I can't find the necessary
material, Magic Grass.  
  
Is it mixed in with the weeds that grow at the forest entrance? Or does
it not grow until deeper into the forest? Probably the latter. MP
recovery potions are sold at higher prices, so I assume the herb is more
difficult to collect than other plants.  
  
My next action is decided. I'll go deep into the \[Twilight Forest\] to
look for Magic Grass. There are fewer enemy monsters than usual now
because players are inside the forest, and I've also gotten new
equipment, so I don't think I'll be easily defeated even if I'm
attacked.  
  
As I was walking towards the forest entrance thinking that, a very
delicious smell of grilled meat wafted from somewhere.  
  
"Ah, Niru! Wait!"  
  
Niru, who was sleeping on my shoulder, suddenly flew away. In that
direction, there was a food stall. It looked very familiar.  
  
"Oh, what is it? Where are you from… or is it Niru? …It's you, isn't it?
Hello there, young lady."  
  
When the old man grilling meat at the stall saw me, he greeted me with a
smile.  
  
"Hello. I didn't expect you to be setting up shop here."  
"Yeah. The sales are better here than in town."  
"By the way, how are your sales?"  
"Thanks to you, the \[Twilight Forest\] branch is doing quite well."  
  
Even while we were talking, customers came, and the old man's grilled
meat skewers sold out. In this game, where you have to eat, food is
something that players will need, along with potions. I noticed that
more food stalls were appearing. I even found the sandwich lady's shop…
I see.  
  
"So, young lady, will you buy some?"  
"Hmm, I suppose…"  
  
I changed my mind and started thinking again. I'm a regular customer of
this shop. So, I feel bad for the old man, but I think I'll go buy some
other food today.  
  
…That's what I thought, but then I saw Niru staring intently at the meat
being grilled. He turned around and looked at me with teary eyes, as if
begging me to buy it.  
  
What's with those eyes? Where did your usual sharp yet sleepy gaze go?
I'm not buying it. Firstly, too much meat is bad for your health. So no,
I'm not buying. I won't buy it... so...  
  
  
"……Alright, six skewers, please."  
"Coming right up!"  
  
So this is the last time I'll spoil you...  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
As usual, even though it's daytime, the forest is very dark. However,
it's not completely dark; there are some sunbeams filtering through the
trees. In this state, dark magic is slightly restricted.  
  
To use my full power, it's best to do it in the middle of the night.
However, here the moonlight is somewhat blocked, so if I'm aiming for
the \[Moonlight\] effect, it's better to fight in an open area.  
  
However, it's daytime now, and there are no problems with fighting.
While walking through the forest, I unexpectedly encountered a
spider-type monster.  
  
The monster, named \[Twilight Spider\], spat webs at me as soon as it
spotted me. The bullet-like webs, when hit, cause a \[Restraint\] effect
that would impede my movement. But they won't hit me.  
  
"\[Wind Shield\]!"  
  
Wind magic is good because it's really fast to cast. It's easy to react
to sudden attacks. As its name suggests, this is a defensive magic. It
creates a wind shield that deflects projectile attacks. The effect lasts
for five seconds. The wind shield that spread around me deflected the
spider's webs into another direction.  
  
Oh, I almost hit Niru who was next to me. It's good he managed to avoid
it. …This shield only deflects attacks with wind, it doesn't nullify
them. So, like now, the deflected webs could hit someone else. I need to
be careful when using this in party play.  
  
When the spider realized that its ranged attack wasn't effective, it
attacked me directly. If I get hit by its direct attack, I'll get
poisoned. I'm resistant to poison, but its attack power is scary. Two or
three hits would be fine, but just in case, I'll have Niru use \[Dark
Mist\].  
  
While the spider ran around confused, unable to see, I cast \[Shadow
Arrow\]. The \[Dark Mist\]'s \[Darkness\] effect lasts five seconds. The
\[Shadow Arrow\] chant time is also five seconds, so I cast the spell
just as the spider's vision recovered. I think the damage ended up being
about 70%. I used \[Wind Cutter\] to reduce its remaining HP.  
  
"Phew…"  
  
Fighting solo like this made me realize how important Kyle-san's
presence was. Having a tank to draw enemy attacks while I easily cast
spells. When fighting solo, I have to create an environment where I can
cast spells first. If I have a spell ready, it's a different story, but
in a sudden battle like this, it's almost impossible. If I always had my
spells on standby, my MP would run out fast.  
  
This time, there was only one spider, which was lucky. If there were
more, it would be much harder. That's probably because there are
currently players around, so the number of enemy monsters in the forest
is low.  
  
So that's how I managed to reach the depths of the forest. The forest
itself is quite large, but the main areas where players are found is
quite narrow.  
  
I quickly found the exit leading to the \[Iru Mines\] just beyond this
forest. To find the exit everyone is looking for so easily… …From there,
I had returned to the depths of the forest to search for Magic Grass and
that's when I met the spider.  
  
Now that the battle is over, let's look for Magic Grass. …I found it
without any problems. It's a bluish plant that tastes like ramune. When
I ate it, it restored a small amount of the magic I had used up in the
previous battle.  
  
It's strange that grass can taste like ramune. But since it tastes like
ramune, it's not bad. I was collecting it and munching on the grass like
a snack when…  
  
"――Whoa! I was surprised. Is that a person…?"  
  
I heard the sound of rustling bushes and a voice. It seems to be a
four-person party currently challenging the forest.  
  
"Oh, to meet people again. I'm very lucky today."  
  
Lucky? The \[Twilight Forest\] is overflowing with people right now.
Well, this is role-playing, so Chloe herself wouldn't know about the
real-world situation. No, role-playing is important, but I have
something to do. Swallowing the Magic Grass I was eating, I smile at the
leader-like person and say,  
  
"It seems you were fighting monsters… Do you have enough potions? I sell
recovery potions."  
  
Potions don't sell at the entrance? Then I'll sell them in the forest.
So, I decided to sell potions in the forest. Mobile sales are pretty
good. Especially in the middle of the forest, you can sell quite a lot.
For parties that are not well prepared and run out of potions even
though they are just a little ways away.  
  
It turned out that the party in front of me were such people, and they
happily bought my potions. Then, they disappeared back into the depths
of the forest… Ah, that's not the direction to the exit. But they
probably don't know that. I have no obligation to tell them either.  
  
Well, I still have stock. Let's sell as much as possible.

\[Duo Region\]Twilight Forest Conquest Thread 87 \[Forest of the

This is the conquest thread for the Forest of the Dead, also known as
the Twilight Forest, located in the Duo Region.  
This is a place for information exchange, so please post party
recruitment in the dedicated thread.  
  
////////////  
  
589://Anonymous User 2  
Bring plenty of potions. They're cheap at the entrance camp right now,
so you might as well stock up.  
  
590://Anonymous User 2  
I just got wiped out, and I'm broke just from equipment repair costs…
I'm giving up on the conquest for today…  
  
591://Anonymous User 2  
\>589 It turns out you end up using it all up pretty quickly...  
  
600://Anonymous User 2  
AAAAAHHHHH!!! PK players should DIE!!!  
  
601://Anonymous User 2  
\>600 What happened!?  
  
602://Anonymous User 2  
I got PK'd just before the exit! Waaaaaaaahhhh!!!  
  
603://Anonymous User 2  
\>602 A three-person group? Or the five-person group?  
  
604://Anonymous User 2  
\>603 The group of five… damn…  
  
605://Anonymous User 2  
\>604 Ah, that one, tough luck.  
  
608://Anonymous User 2  
Another PK report. Isn't that a bit much?  
  
609://Anonymous User 2  
\>608 There seem to be two or three PK parties in the forest.  
  
610://Anonymous User 2  
Damn, I'll be careful too.  
  
611://Anonymous User 2  
The tragedy at the port again… I mean, a subjugation force was formed
there, and yet they're still PKing.  
  
612://Anonymous User 2  
\>611 PKs won't disappear. I think those guys I saw in the fishing
village are still around, so I think PK reports will increase again.  
  
615://Anonymous User 2  
PKs are scary, so I want to get through the forest quickly. I'm tired of
dark places.  
  
617://Anonymous User 2  
\>615 The Iru Mines beyond are also dark though?  
  
618://Anonymous User 2  
\>617 That place is still sparkly and beautiful. The Twilight Forest is
just dark.  
  
620://Anonymous User 2  
Are there any second batch players who have broken through the forest?  
  
621://Anonymous User 2  
Quite a few. I think everyone is still increasing their forest
exploration rate.  
  
622://Anonymous User 2  
I just got out of the forest!  
  
623://Anonymous User 2  
\>622 Seriously!?  
  
624://Anonymous User 2  
\>622 For reference, how much did you raise your forest exploration
rate?  
  
625://Anonymous User 2  
\>624 My exploration rate was around 50%. I think I got out because I
asked for directions this time.  
  
626://Anonymous User 2  
\>625 Asked for directions? Did the first batch also get directions?  
  
627://Anonymous User 2  
I saw a first batch player charging for directions and thought I might
as well ask for directions too…  
  
628://Anonymous User 2  
A player selling potions in the forest told me.  
  
630://Anonymous User 2  
\>628 Huh? They didn't tell me!  
  
631://Anonymous User 2  
\>630 Did you buy potions? Maybe they don't tell you if you don't buy.  
  
633://Anonymous User 2  
\>631 I bought them. But I didn't ask for directions. They could have
told me if they knew.  
  
634://Anonymous User 2  
\>633 I didn't ask for directions either. But they told me as they were
leaving. Why?  
  
635://Anonymous User 2  
Maybe the potion seller was a different player?  
  
636://Anonymous User 2  
\>635 The person who told me seemed like a witch.  
  
637://Anonymous User 2  
\>636 It's the same person. Why didn't they tell me?  
  
639://Anonymous User 2  
Maybe it's a whim, or maybe they liked the character of the person they
told.  
  
640://Anonymous User 2  
\>639 Maybe they liked one of the party members? I was alone in the
forest so I just called out to her, wondering what she was doing...  
  
641://Anonymous User 2  
\>640 With NPCs or role-players, actions can change depending on the
conditions. You probably did something that prompted them to give
directions without even knowing it.  
  
642://Anonymous User 2  
\>641 I guess so? Anyway, thanks to that person, I was able to get out
of the forest, so the reason doesn't matter.
