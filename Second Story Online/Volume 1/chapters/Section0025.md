# 25・Let's Fight At Night

The sunlight filtering through the forest indicated the setting sun. It
should be getting dark soon… but right now, time seems to be slowing
down.  
  
“Azi, watch out for the enemy's magic!”  
“I know. You should be the one providing support! And… why are \*you\*
giving orders? I'm the leader.”  
  
A girl with twin daggers scolded the elf as she charged at me. I'll
unleash a quick \[Wind Cutter\].  
  
“An attack like that won't work on me!”  
  
The attack hit, but the cat-eared girl kept running. She doesn't seem to
have taken much damage. As she ran, I saw an effect enveloping her. The
dwarf had just cast a spell, so it seems like some kind of magic attack
reduction technique.  
  
“Got you!”  
“Oh really?”  
  
Before her blade reaches me, I activate \[Wind Cutter\] again.  
  
“That attack won't work… Wh-?!”  
  
The thing that was protecting her vanished with a high-pitched \*ping\*
sound and effect. And with that, the \[Wind Cutter\] hit her directly,
since she wasn't even thinking about dodging it.  
  
“…Tch.”  
  
I tried to seize the opportunity to cast a follow-up spell… but an arrow
came flying, so I used \[Wind Shield\] to block it. I glared at the elf
archer.  
  
“…Understood. I'll leave Azi to you, Bluey.”  
  
I could see the dwarf with the staff nod at the elf's words. It seems
like they're having an important conversation through party chat, so
it's frustrating not knowing what they're saying. Even if I could hear
it, I don't know if there was any way for me to counter them.  
  
“Secretly whispering away like that… do you really need to go to such
lengths against just one person?”  
  
Winning in this situation is difficult, so there's only one thing for me
to do: role-play. Focusing my power into my staff, I'll use role-play
against them.  
  
“Don't you feel ashamed of yourselves? Ah… to target such a weak woman…
how cruel.”  
  
Let me try lowering my eyes a little and acting like a fragile girl.  
  
“W-well… hearing you say that, my conscience is starting to hurt… Hey,
why don't we just call it off this time?”  
  
Oh, it seems to have worked on the cat-eared girl. They seem to be
bandits, but not completely evil. Stealing is a crime, though.  
  
“Azi, you were the one who said to attack! I haven't forgotten!”  
“That's right. First of all, I was against it. Someone walking alone in
a forest like this... she's no good."  
  
Don't glare at me like that. It's a little scary. …Should I end this
now?  
  
“No, that's not right. You're not alone, are you?”  
“…Fufu, well, it's true that I'm not alone...――Niru!”  
  
At that moment, Niru appears from above. And again, he cast \[Dark
Mist\] on them. Since I used it before, I had to wait to use it again
until the cooldown was over. So I had to buy some time.  
  
“Again?! Hey, Bluey!”  
“I know!”  
  
I know they'll cure the status ailment soon. But if I can just buy a
little time…  
  
“Take down the one above!”  
“I don't need to be told!”  
  
An arrow was released with a whistling sound. The target is Niru. Before
I can tell him to dodge, it seems to have hit. I can see my allies'
stats on the left side of my vision. Niru's HP was halved. Oh well, Niru
is a familiar. He's weak against attacks like this. …I'll leave the
archer to him.  
  
“Why are you using magic?!”  
  
I don't have time to look up. The cat-eared girl charged in. I have to
deal with her. What is she even saying?  
  
“I'm a witch, so it's only natural that I'd use magic.”  
  
I had begun chanting a spell, and an effect enveloped my body. So they
can see that I'm about to use magic.  
  
“Quickly, stop that magic!”  
  
I can't move much while casting. And even if I try to dodge, she's too
fast. I got slashed by her dagger, and a red effect spurted from the
wound like blood. My HP is down to 60%. If I keep taking these attacks,
I'll die and wake up in town. But—  
  
“No, I won't stop!”  
  
I won't die until I at least take one of them down.  
  
Before the next attack comes, I finished chanting and activated \[Dark
Burst\]. The magic affects me, the girl, and the other two who were just
barely within range, and everyone was sent flying.  
  
I don't expect much damage. It's not night yet, and they're resistant to
magic. If Niru were here, he would have used \[Cold Gaze\] to dispel
those buffs, like before. Sadly, it seems he's been taken down.  
  
This spell requires a ten-second chant. I needed that chanting time. I
needed to keep their attention on something other than me, even if just
for a little while. Thanks to Niru.  
  
Ah, and I'm glad the cat-eared girl didn't interrupt my chant with her
attack. I've heard that if you're attacked while chanting, the chant
will be interrupted. Apparently, you can withstand a few minor attacks.
If I'd taken a second hit, it probably would have been interrupted. A
surprise attack would be impossible to defend against.  
  
“What was that?! I'm surprised!”  
“That was Dark Burst, a dark magic spell. It wasn't very powerful
because it's not night yet, but it will be soon. Be careful.”  
“Azi, retreat for now. Bluey, heal her. I'll go find the target!”  
  
I can hear their voices in the distance. I'm hiding in the shadows of
the grass after being blown away. But I don't want to hide like this.
I'll move around this area while still being visible.  
  
“Found her! Go after her, Azi!”  
“Why are you giving orders?! I'm the leader!”  
  
You may be the leader. But the real leader is probably him. I'll move
along, with that leader-chan in tow.  
  
Along the way, I used a potion to heal… Ah, I have a small idea, so I'll
use another, better potion after the cooldown. Better safe than sorry,
after all.
