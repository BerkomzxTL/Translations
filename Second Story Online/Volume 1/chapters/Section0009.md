Owls! I can't tame owls!  
Someone help me!  
  
251:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>250 The ones in \[Twilight Forest\]? Aren't those rare monsters, so
they're difficult to tame?  
  
252:// Anonymous Second Person  
That brings back memories... I remember it was a Twilight Owl, which you
would occasionally encounter if you went at night.  
My whole party was wiped out by its darkness.  
  
253:// Anonymous Second Person  
Even the deer that are regular monsters are dangerous, you know. They
can hypnotize you.  
  
254:// Anonymous Second Person  
Paralyzing mushrooms, poisonous spiders… the monsters in that forest are
a parade of abnormal status ailments.  
Plus, the forest itself is like a dungeon; you get lost easily. That's
why it got the nickname "Forest of the Dead," right?  
  
255:// Anonymous Second Person  
Why is a place with a forest like that considered a beginner-friendly
region…?  
  
256:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>255 It's only beginner-friendly compared to other places…  
  
257:// Anonymous Tamer  
Man… someone teach me how to tame…  
My role-play isn't complete.  
  
258:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>257 Reduce its HP. Level up your tamer skill. Whether you can tame a
rare monster depends on your luck.  
Also, go to the tamer thread, not here.

I messed up choosing the Duo region. I should have chosen the Heiss
Region…  
The princess of the Ente Kingdom is super cute! What the heck!  
  
261:// Anonymous Second Person  
Queen Swaro is good too, you know!  
  
262:// Anonymous Second Person  
She's an old woman!  
  
263:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>260 Look! \[Picture\]  
  
264:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>263 Who is this cute girl?!  
  
265:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>264 You can meet her if you go to Berry Village.  
  
266:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>265 Seriously?! I'm almost there so let's go!  
  
268:// Anonymous Second Person  
The king and prince are cool, but I feel like the quality of the women
is better in other regions.  
  
275:// Anonymous Second Person  
Speaking of the conversation above, I remember seeing a weird person in
\[Twilight Forest\]. Does anyone know them?  
A woman in a black cloak was muttering something unintelligible while
eating weeds…  
  
276:// Anonymous Second Person  
Scary!  
  
277:// Anonymous Second Person  
Could it be a deer or something? A mistake?  
  
278:// Anonymous Second Person  
It was a person. Some kind of witch-like figure. She disappeared
quickly, and I tried to follow her but lost sight of her.  
  
279:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>278 I was in the early group, but I don't remember seeing anyone like
that.  
  
280:// Anonymous Second Person  
\>279 Seriously? Then what did I see?  
  
281:// Anonymous Second Person  
Was it really a ghost?  
  
282:// Anonymous Second Person  
Another mystery added to the Forest of the Dead…  
  
  
//////////////////////////  
  
  
  
“Hey, Niru, look. It says ‘witch’! It says I’m witch-like!”  
  
I was so happy that I woke up Niru, who was sleeping on the tip of my
staff, and showed him the screen I had set up. Niru looked at it with
half-closed eyes and tilted his head.  
  
I was called a witch. There’s no way I, who aspires to be a witch,
wouldn't be happy to hear that. Well, it’s just “witch-like,” and I’ve
also been called a ghost and various other things…  
  
“….hehe”  
  
I’m happy enough to smirk while looking at the screen. If I met the
person who wrote this post, I'd like to thank them.  
  
…However, there’s one thing that concerns me. It seems that Niru, a
\[Twilight Owl\], is difficult to tame. I found out after researching,
but the average level in the \[Twilight Forest\] is 20. Even people who
seem to be tamers at the recommended level have difficulty taming it, so
I don't understand why he became my familiar.  
  
Is it the difference between \[Capture\] and \[Contract\]? \[Capture\]
is catching a monster and making it a pet; the monster's will isn't
involved. But I remember hearing somewhere that \[Contract\] won't work
unless the other party agrees. I think there was also a report that
\[Summon: Element\], which uses the same \[Contract\] to handle spirits,
failed because the spirits they were contracting didn't agree.  
  
Tamers can capture without the other party’s consent. However, the
difficulty of capturing is affected by level, etc. Familiars and
elements can be contracted if the other party agrees, regardless of
level, and conversely, if they don't agree, it's impossible even at a
low level.  
  
“So that means Niru agreed”  
  
The \[Command\] skill activated, but it probably failed. Judging from
Niru's level at the time and the skill level difference of the command,
there's no way it would have succeeded.  
...By issuing an order, it seems possible to force the other party into
agreeing to a contract. Although that's not a method I'd really like to
use.  
  
Well, that’s the end of my break.  
Both Niru and I are better at night, so we came to the Dairode market.  
This time I came to sell potions. I originally made potions to make
money.  
I’ve already researched the stores I’ll sell to. The source of
information? It’s the man from the food stall. Surely, an incident like
last time won't happen again.  
  
From the market where the food stalls are lined up, we headed to the
shopping street. There are quite a few people here too. Among them, in a
dark place in a back alley, but with an atmosphere that clearly suggests
a hidden gem, there was a general store.  
  
“□□□□～!”  
  
…A young female shopkeeper greeted me with a welcoming atmosphere.
Showing her the memo the old man wrote, I took out the potions, and the
woman began to appraise them with a cheerful smile. She asked some
questions, but I didn’t really understand them. The woman seemed to
realize this too, so she gave up on the questions and brought up the
purchase screen.  
  
\[Beginner Recovery Potion: ☆☆\] ×10 1200G  
  
120G each… That's strange. I thought the market price was around 100G
each, but whatever. This completes the trade. By the way, I have about
five more potions left, but they're for my own use.  
Now that the trade is over, I’ll take a look at this store’s goods. As
expected of a general store, they have various potions and torches for
lighting at night. They also sell small items and daily necessities like
soap, and the customers in the store are about half adventurers and half
residents.  
  
Ah, a broom! There’s a broom! What should I do, I kinda want it. I mean,
brooms are a witch's thing! I even took up \[Wind Magic\] because I
wanted to fly in the sky on a broom someday!  
1000G is expensive… But it's not impossible to buy. So, before I knew
it, it was in my item storage. This is for my witch role-play. It feels
like my income disappears on the spot even when I earn money. Well, I
can just earn more later. By the way, it’s just a normal broom, so it
doesn’t have any effects like increasing attack power or anything like
that.  
  
I bid farewell to the shopkeeper and headed back towards the market. I
came to a stall owner's shop and bowed in thanks. Then the man called
out to me. I couldn't understand what he was saying...  
  
《A skill obtainable by certain actions has been added.》  
  
I immediately call up the screen. I checked the list of obtainable
skills, and there it was…  
  
\[Language: Swaro Kingdom\]  
  
Yes! Finally, a language appeared! I immediately used 1 SP to acquire
the skill.  
  
“….Old man, do you understand what I’m saying?”  
  
“Young lady--, can--talk”  
  
I didn't understand some of what the man was saying, but I was able to
understand a little bit.  
I couldn't help but rejoice with the old man. It's great to be able to
speak the language!  
  
As a celebration, I received ten skewers of meat from the old man. No, I
don't need any more skewers of meat.
