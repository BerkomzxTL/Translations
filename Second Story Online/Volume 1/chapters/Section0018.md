# 18・The Village Chief's Desire

"Goodness, to think you'd finish off the goblin extermination so
quickly. And you even gathered the herb I requested... Thank you so
much!"  
  
The village chief looked overjoyed by our report. That's why I'm a
little suspicious. Kyle-san glanced at me. I nodded silently in response
and spoke to the village chief.  
  
"...Excuse me, but what is this herb used for?"  
"Ah, this plant, when mixed, becomes a panacea."  
"But this herb seems to contain poison..."  
"Indeed, it has poison. But if properly prepared, it becomes
medicine."  
"I see."  
  
Certainly, poison can be medicine. Judging that I couldn't ask any
further, I shut my mouth.  
  
"Thank you very much. If you could come again for future goblin
exterminations, I would be grateful."  
  
《Quest Cleared》  
《Received 1500G》  
《Received 1500G》  
  
Apparently, the quest was cleared from a system perspective. I received
3000G for goblin extermination and herb gathering.  
  
"You're welcome. We help each other when in need. Well then, we'll be
off now, and we'll come to check up on things again soon."  
  
Having received our reward, we had no choice but to leave the village
chief's house.  
  
"...What do you think, Chloe-san?"  
  
When we were far enough away from the village chief's house, Kyle-san
called out to me again.  
  
"What do you mean?"  
"The request is over, but... is it really over with just this?"  
  
A typical goblin extermination request, plus a slightly unusual
herb-gathering request. Looking at it alone, it just seems like an
increase in requests. However, this time, the type of herb and the
person who requested it were no good.  
  
"I wonder if it was really okay to give that herb to him... If he's
planning to use it to make poison..."  
"Do you think the village chief would commit suicide? No way. If he
wants to commit suicide, all he needs is a knife."  
  
Driven by the sadness of losing his daughter and following her... that's
the first thing that comes to mind. But as I said before, if that were
the only reason, he wouldn't still be alive. If he wanted to die without
suffering, he wouldn't choose a painful method, like poisoning. Unless
that poison happened to be painless, I suppose.  
  
"...That's certainly true."  
  
Kyle-san didn't seem convinced.  
  
"...I understand your feelings. Niru, don't you think so too?"  
  
Niru has been looking at the village chief's house with a complicated
expression for a while now. He's awake even though it's daytime. No,
that's not important right now. Niru seems to have a keen eye for
people. That's why I'm still curious about that village chief.  
  
"That village chief seems likely to cause some trouble... I'm worried,
so would you like to stay here a little longer?"  
"Yes, let's. How about we take turns watching the village chief's
house?"  
  
I nodded at Kyle-san's suggestion. If nothing really happens after
this... that would be boring.  
  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  
Well, I asked Kyle-san to keep an eye on the village chief. Which means
I'm free right now. Let's see... I also have some herbs I picked up, so
let's make some potions.  
  
And since I'm at it, I want to experiment...  
  
"...Is there a well somewhere around here?"  
  
That's right. I need water. The mysterious spring water doesn't taste
very good. I asked the locals and they led me to some.  
  
I drew water from the well. Clean, clear water was obtained. The item is
exactly what it sounds like--well water. I took a sip and it was
delicious. It didn't taste like that weird water. This looks
promising.  
  
I immediately put the well water in a pot, added the crushed herbs, and
simmered it. After boiling for a few minutes in a good
intermediate-level pot, a sweet, pleasant aroma wafted through the air.
When I tasted it, it had the same sweet taste as the herbs themselves.
Apparently, the cause of the bad taste was indeed the water.  
  
Paying attention to the boiling time, I successfully finished brewing
the potions.  
  
\[Delicious Beginner Healing Potion:☆☆☆\]×10  
  
The name includes "Delicious." I tried a taste test of the completed
potion, and it was indeed delicious. It wasn't so bitter that I wanted
to spit it out like before. Also, I don't know if it's because I used an
intermediate-level pot, but it's three stars.  
  
"Niru, look! I made delicious potions!"  
  
I bragged to Niru, but he didn't seem interested and remained asleep.
It's delicious, you know. Although it's true that taste doesn't matter
much for potions, which are mainly used topically.  
  
"…………?"  
  
That's when it happened. I felt someone looking at me so I turned to
face that direction. I could only see the shadow of a building, but
nothing else.  
  
"Just my imagination...?"  
  
Something felt off. Niru, who had been sleeping, was also staring
intently at that spot. But then he went back to sleep.  
  
No matter how much I think about it, it doesn't seem like it will solve
anything. I left it alone and went to collect a lot of well water for
future use.  
  
Oh, a villager came to draw water, so I'll let them go first. This is
the village well, after all. Apparently, it's the only well in the
village, and everyone uses it. It's a small village, so one well is
enough.  
  
"…………"  
  
...Only one well?  
  
"Hey, Niru. If we were to pour poison into this well... it would
probably kill everyone in the village."  
  
Niru opened his eyes in surprise at my dangerous words.  
  
I should get in touch with Kyle-san. Since I've registered him as my
friend, we can communicate at any time.  
  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  
A considerable amount of time has passed since then. Well, by
"considerable," I mean in-game time. It's gone from daytime to
nighttime.  
  
"I'd rather not have to come here..."  
  
Kyle-san, standing next to me, says that. Well, that's what his
character would say. Kyle-san is staring intently at the well in the
distance.  
  
"It's just speculation, though."  
  
If the village chief wasn't that kind of person, we wouldn't be here.
But if he does come...  
  
"...It seems to be just as you expected."  
  
A figure could be seen moving in the darkness. The figure walked
cautiously, as if sneaking around, moving straight towards the well.  
  
Kyle-san cast a light spell. The illuminating light clearly revealed the
person in the shadows.  
  
"Good evening, Village Chief-san."  
  
I greeted the surprised village chief. I spread my skirt and curtsied
properly.  
  
"Wh-what is it, you lot? Why are you here!?"  
"Village Chief-san, why are you here?"  
"I just came to get some water."  
"Then what's with that bottle in your hand? It looks like it has liquid
in it..."  
  
At Kyle-san's words, the village chief hastily hides what he was
holding. It looked like a potion. The liquid was purple.  
  
"If you're thirsty, why not just drink that? Well, you wouldn't be able
to drink it, as it's poison."  
"Tch! I should have asked someone else after all."  
  
A clear click of the tongue was heard, and I thought, "Ah, so that's
it." It seems the village chief planned to poison the well and wipe out
the village.  
  
"Were you planning to kill the villagers?"  
"…………"  
  
The village chief averted his gaze. I asked to confirm, and it seemed to
be the case. Now, the next question is the motive. I can think of two
possible reasons, but which one is it?  
  
"Why were you going to go that far?"  
"…………For my daughter, of course!"  
  
...I see, it was for his daughter. If the destruction of the village was
the goal, I thought the village chief had a hand in the previous goblin
attack...apparently, it wasn't related.  
  
"For your daughter? How would this act benefit your daughter?"  
"That's...to bring my daughter back to life!"  
  
The village chief attacked me. Apparently, he can use magic, and a
fireball flew towards me.  
  
"Are you alright, Chloe-san!"  
"Yes, thank you."  
  
Kyle-san seems to have blocked the magic. It was sudden, so he didn't
have his shield, only his body. Thank you. For now, I'll toss a potion
to heal him.  
  
"To bring her back to life... is that it?"  
  
Would killing the villagers be a sacrifice? The truth of this incident
is gradually becoming clear.  
  
"Village Chief, calm down!"  
"Don't interfere!"  
  
Kyle-san's voice didn't reach the village chief. It seems he intends to
eliminate us, the eyewitnesses. The village chief prepared to attack
again. I also took out my staff.  
  
"...Chloe-san, don't interfere."  
"Why?"  
"Chloe-san's magic is too high-powered. It'll definitely kill the
village chief."  
  
...I guess so. And it's night now. Regardless of the type of magic,
magic enhanced by the \[Moonlight\] effect will defeat the enemy without
mercy. The village chief can use magic, but he's probably weaker than
the goblins. Kyle-san could easily defeat him.  
  
"Then what should we do?"  
"I'll persuade the village chief."  
  
Kyle-san intercepted another fireball. This time, he blocked it with his
shield, so his HP didn't decrease. But he can't hold out forever.  
  
"Can't we just finish this with one blow? It would be easier."  
"Chloe-san?! That's not okay!"  
  
It's true this is a situation where we need to persuade the village
chief. But, sorry, Kyle-san. If Chloe were someone with a strong sense
of justice, that would be one thing, but Chloe doesn't seem like that
kind of character... Chloe isn't exactly a good person.  
In this case, too, she didn't stop the village chief out of
righteousness, but stayed in the village because she was curious.  
  
"...Then persuade him. If it doesn't work, I'll finish him off with
magic."  
  
But I want to bring this to a point where we can persuade him. So I'll
leave it to Kyle-san.  
  
"...Understood. I will definitely try my best to persuade him."  
  
Kyle-san smiled brightly and replied. Should I perhaps switch to being a
good witch?  
  
"Village Chief, even if you sacrifice this village's people to revive
your daughter, will that truly be in her best interest?!"  
"Shut up! She's all I have left..."  
"Do you think your daughter would be happy if you did something like
this?!"  
  
At Kyle-san's straightforward words, the village chief's face contorted
painfully. He's probably wavering. Talking might work.  
  
"Oh... Are you going to abandon your daughter? This is your chance to
bring her back to life."  
  
At that moment, a voice could be heard. Something suddenly appeared
behind the village chief.  
  
"Good evening~ Excuse me for intruding, onii-sans~"  
  
A small child with painfully bright pink hair. Two black goat-like horns
grew from her head, which didn't match her cute appearance. She also had
bat wings and a tail. She was wearing a revealing bikini-like outfit, a
demonic child.  
  
"Who are you?"  
"I'm a kind young girl who came to grant the village chief's wish!"  
"Don't mess with me."  
"No~ Scary~ Don't get so angry, onii-san~?"  
  
Kyle-san glared at Devil-chan as she stood close to the village chief. A
handsome glare can be quite frightening. No, in this case, the intensity
isn't exactly unjustified. Niru has been glaring at Devil-chan for a
while now.  
  
"Now, old man, I'll take care of these two, so please just throw that
into the well. Then your daughter will come back to life, okay?"  
"Ah, yes."  
  
Following Devil-chan's voice, the village chief started running. The
destination is the well.  
  
"Wait!"  
"Lily told you Lily would take care of you onii-san!"  
  
Kyle-san tried to chase after him, but was blocked by Devil-chan.  
  
"Get out of the way!"  
"Onii-san, you're different this time~ Scary~!"  
  
...I agree with that. Kyle-san's expression as he fights Devil-chan,
wielding a large scythe of unknown origin, is not at all the face of a
hero of justice.  
  
"Oh, pardon me... Pl-please step out of the way, young lady!"  
  
Kyle-san returned to his usual refreshing demeanor. What was that just
now? Was that his true self? Anyway, it's the village chief. Kyle-san
doesn't seem to be able to make it in time... There's nothing I can
do.  
  
"Stop!"  
  
I shouted, looking at the village chief. He stopped at my voice. It
seemed that the \[Command\] skill worked.  
  
"Niru!"  
  
Niru interfered with the village chief, snatching the poison.  
  
"Ah, how terrible! The old man worked so hard on that... Auntie, don't
interfere!"  
  
Auntie. Auntie? Is that so? Chloe looks young, right? She's around
seventeen years old according to her settings. To be called an Auntie...
ah, this is a bit irritating. So...  
  
"I'd prefer it if you called me 'onee-san.'"  
  
I smiled sweetly and cast a dark magic spell. See, Chloe isn't a very
good person.  
  
"Whoa! What kind of magic is this? It's scary!"  
  
Devil-chan was surprised by the power of the direct hit of the \[Shadow
Arrow\]. She hastily used a potion to recover her health.
\[Moonlight\] + \[Rebellion\] + \[Dark Wisdom\] + Dark Magic is a
powerful combination at night. It gets even more powerful depending on
the phase of the moon.  
Still, I can't see the opponent's HP bar. It seems the opponent is at a
higher level. The rebellion effect was activated. I can see the village
chief's HP without any problems. ...I feel like I can see a little more
information now.  
  
"Give it back! That!"  
"I won't."  
  
I used \[Wind Cutter\] to block Devil-chan's path to protect Niru, who
is holding the poison. She seemed to be wary of my magic, so she dodged
it. Kyle-san blocked her path.  
  
"Get out of the way, onii-san!"  
"Humph, I can't do that little missy.... Oh, I messed up again..."  
  
Kyle-san, your role-playing has been off for a while now. But that
villainous face was good! I thought the combination of knight and witch
wouldn't work, but with that Kyle-san, I think we could take a village
or two. Though right now, we're not trying to take down a village, but
defending it with all our might.  
  
"Mmm~! I feel like this is a bit tough~!"  
  
Kyle-san intercepted all the attacks, and if she tried to attack from
behind, a near-death-level spell would fly in. Kyle-san's HP is being
restored by me throwing potions at him. If we can defeat her before the
potion's cooldown is up, it'll be good, but it's difficult to whittle
her down with the combination of Devil-chan and the village chief.
Although, thanks to the persuasion effect from earlier, the village
chief isn't much use.  
  
The same goes for us. We can't defeat the village chief, and Devil-chan
is quite tough. Kyle-san's attacks are hitting, but she desperately
avoids my magic. Even if it does hit, she recovers with a potion.  
  
Moreover, Devil-chan is summoning several monster-like beings. Is this a
summon? They aren't strong individually, but they're extremely annoying.
I want to use \[Dark Bind\] or \[Dark Burst\], but it'll drag in the
village chief.  
  
"Little girl, die... I mean, young lady, give it up and retreat. We
don't want to engage in unnecessary conflict."  
  
I seem to have heard some dangerous words just now. Was it just my
imagination, Kyle-san?  
However, Devil-chan seems ineterested in this proposal. Although it
appears to be a close match, Devil-chan is at a disadvantage.  
  
  
"Ugh... I'll get you back for this someday! Remember that!"  
  
With a frustrated look on her face, Devil-chan left behind some typical
parting words, then vanished as if swallowed by the darkness. Left
behind were the witch, the knight, and the village chief.  
  
"Ah...ahem. Village chief, it seems you were possessed by a demon..."  
  
Kyle-san returned to his usual demeanor and spoke to the village chief.
The chief, seemingly having no further intention to fight, listened
quietly to what Kyle-san had to say. I suppose I should leave the
persuasion to him.  
  
"Niru, good work. You did well."  
  
I stroked Niru, who had been flying and running around. He looked tired
and sleepy, but happy to be praised. I took a rest with Niru and ate a
light snack while waiting for the conversation with the village chief to
finish. Then, I noticed that the night had broken and the morning sun
was shining down.  
  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  
"I truly caused you a great deal of trouble this time... but thanks to
you all, I managed to avoid going down the wrong path."  
  
We were invited back to the village chief's house. There, the village
chief, fully awake, offered his apologies and gratitude.  
  
"Village chief, you were taken advantage of, your desire to see your
beloved daughter again exploited. While it's true that you succumbed to
that temptation, it was all that demon's fault."  
  
Kyle-san smiled kindly… ah, that's what a holy knight is like. Where's
the dark knight Kyle-san from before? I preferred that one. But it seems
I won't be seeing that Kyle-san again. Too bad. But was that Kyle-san
really? I should ask him later.  
  
"This is a small token of my apology for the trouble caused... please
take it."  
"No, but..."  
"Take it. It's my way of making amends."  
  
《Received a reward from Berry Village Chief》  
  
I was given 10,000G by the village chief. To receive even more money
unexpectedly...  
  
"I'm truly grateful. Both my daughter and I... to you, the saviors of
Berry Village."  
  
《Epic Quest: Completion of the Village Chief's Wish recorded. Rating: S
Rank. Congratulations. Received 5 bonus skill points.》  
《Title: Savior of Berry Village acquired》  
《Upload the video of this Epic Quest to the History?》  
  
...Ah, so it was an Epic Quest after all. Kyle-san, who was sitting next
to me, looked at me in surprise.  
  
"...Um, let's talk outside, Chloe-san."  
  
I bid farewell to the village chief with Kyle-san and left the house.
After confirming that there was no one around, Kyle-san spoke to me.  
  
"...So it was an Epic Quest after all."  
"Yes, it was."  
  
A special Epic Quest that affects the world. To think it was really
happening without us being informed... If we had attacked the village
chief back then, he really would have died.  
  
"I was really surprised back then... I didn't know you were that kind of
character..."  
"Ah, but you also got weird midway, Kyle-san. Was that character
design?"  
"No, that's not it...I got a little carried away by the opponent's
acting... occupational habit, or something..."  
  
Occupational habit? Kyle-san, are you saying you do that in real life?
I'm a little curious, but I'm scared so I won't ask.  
  
"Oh, right. About uploading the video to the History, I'd like to skip
it this time. There were parts where I wasn't fully in character, and I
don't want others to see the final battle..."  
"Yeah, that's fine."  
"Really?! I'm sorry. Despite being a role-player, I can't upload a
perfectly good video..."  
"Um, what does that mean?"  
"Ah? Oh, I guess Chloe-san doesn't know."  
  
Apparently, for the role-players in this game, uploading videos to the
History holds a special meaning.  
  
"The History is, so to speak, a record of the history of this SSO world.
Your achievements are recorded as official history... it's like having
your picture in a history textbook. Any role-player would want to have
their accomplishments recorded, even once. I'm sure there are many
people who would like to have their exploits published as videos as
well."  
  
I see. I think I understand why there are so many role-players in this
game.  
  
"Watching videos of those who perfectly role-played is fun. It feels
like watching an anime. And someday, I want to make my Kyle-san like
that, a main character... oh, forget what I just said."  
  
Kyle-san looked a little embarrassed and turned his face away. Kyle-san,
you want to be the main character, huh? Indeed, a righteous knight like
Kyle-san might be suitable to be the protagonist.  
  
For the time being, as Kyle-san suggested, I decided not to upload the
video. Apparently, for Epic Quests, those involved can choose whether or
not to upload it, and the choice with more votes is selected. If you
don't choose, it won't be counted as a vote against uploading. Since
both of us chose not to upload, the video was not uploaded. By the way,
the events themselves will be recorded in the History as a simple text.
Only the events are recorded, so character names are not included.  
  
"If it's a major event, individuals might also be named."  
  
In this case, it seems that it won't be published because it happened in
a small village in a rural area.  
  
"Well, I guess this is goodbye then. Thank you for everything."  
"Thank you very much."  
  
Kyle-san has a strong sense of justice. But deep down he's a bit of an
old man, likes women, and occasionally shows a dark side. But there's no
doubt he's a good role-player. I'm looking forward to the day your video
features you as the protagonist.  
  
"Well then, Chloe-san, I'll take my leave. Let's meet again
somewhere."  
"Let's meet again sometime."  
  
Let's exchange greetings as characters too. When will I meet Kyle-san
again in this world? We might meet sooner than expected.  
  
...Speaking of which. I still have that poison. Niru took it, so it
naturally became mine. I don't have any use for it for now, but I'll
keep it in my inventory.
