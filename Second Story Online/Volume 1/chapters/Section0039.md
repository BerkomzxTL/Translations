# 39・Untrustworthy Witch

"Thank you for cleaning. Come in quickly, I won't eat you."  
  
The room is dusty, similar to the previous one. And there's an old woman
sitting in a chair, beckoning us closer. She's wearing a black robe,
looking exactly like a witch, with the black cat approaching her.  
  
"I apologize for testing you. But I had my reasons. I couldn't easily
trust you. So I decided to wait and see how things went."  
"Excuse me, but who are you?"  
"Ah, yes. I should introduce myself first."  
  
The old woman smiled kindly at the wary Tsubaki-san.  
  
"My name is Lucille. I'm a humble magician. You are Chloe, Kyle, and
Tsubaki, right? Ah, and also your companions, Niru, Earl, and Haku."  
  
Lucille-san pointed to each of us as she said our names.  
  
"I don't recall us giving our names..."  
"Hehehe. Don't look so scary, young man. I was only listening to your
conversation through my familiar."  
  
The black cat meowed while being stroked. Apparently, the black cat is
Lucille-san's familiar. …That's a bit disappointing.  
  
"More importantly, Lucille-san, I'd like an explanation for inviting us
here. It wasn't just for cleaning; you have another request, right?"  
"Hehehe. That's right. I'm glad you figured it out quickly. I have a
request for you. Of course, it's not about cleaning the room. Though, in
a way, you could call it cleaning."  
  
Lucille-san, who had been smiling gently, now had a serious
expression.  
  
"Do you know about the red beast that appeared in the Twilight
Forest?"  
"……I only know of it through rumors."  
"I saw it firsthand. I was even attacked."  
"And Tsubaki?"  
  
Tsubaki-san nodded, indicating she knew as well.  
  
"Right, then I don't need to explain. That red beast is a threat. So I
want you to defeat it. That's my request. Will you accept?"  
  
No one answered. The room fell silent. Well, I kind of understand. What
she says might be true, but we can't just nod in agreement so easily.  
  
"I understand it's a threat, but why do you want us to defeat that
beast?"  
"Of course, it's for the peace of those who travel through that
forest."  
"That forest has been dangerous for a long time. And why do you want
peace there?"  
"...What a troublesome girl. Do you really need more reasons than that?
I've introduced myself and explained the reason for my request."  
"I can't trust you enough to agree."  
  
I can't see a reason to defeat the beast for her. If she just wants
peace, why would she bring us here in such a roundabout way? It's
incredibly suspicious.  
  
"Now, now, calm down, Chloe-san."  
"Kyle-san."  
"I think we can trust her. I think she genuinely wants peace for the
people. Besides, we can't leave that beast alone."  
  
That's true. Regardless of her motives, leaving that beast alone is
dangerous.  
  
"Let me tell you, I don't trust you either."  
"……Then why not ask someone you can trust?"  
"I can't do that. You're the only ones I can ask. Well, I trust Kyle's
character."  
  
In other words, she doesn't trust me and Tsubaki-san.  
  
"……Regardless of whether we accept the request, may I ask something?
That beast might already be defeated."  
  
When I saw it before, it was being chased by those shiny gold guys.
Maybe they defeated it.  
  
"Ah, unfortunately, it hasn't been defeated yet."  
"How do you know that?"  
"Because it's a creature tainted by Chaos. It's not that easily
defeated."  
  
Lucille-san said bitterly.  
Still… Chaos? What's that? Hmm, I feel like I've heard that word
somewhere, but I can't quite remember where…  
  
"Are you referring to the Chaos Dragon often mentioned in old tales?"  
"That's right. The Chaos Dragon is on a different scale, but it's
basically the same. A creature contaminated by fragments of Chaos."  
  
Ah, I remember. There was a story like that in the history of this game.
Kyle-san's conversation reminded me of that.  
  
A sealed entity called Chaos. Even sealed, it remains a threat to this
world.  
  
Apparently, small fragments of Chaos still remain scattered throughout
the world, and if contaminated by them, one loses their self and
indiscriminately destroys their surroundings.  
  
The Chaos Dragon was also affected by a large fragment, causing immense
damage to the world.  
  
"Then it's an impossible task for us. Only a hero's power can defeat
it."  
  
Yes, that's right. It takes the power of heroes to purify the power of
Chaos.  
  
"What a waste of time. Excuse me, I'll take my leave."  
"Wa-wait, Tsubaki-san!"  
  
Kyle-san stopped Tsubaki-san, who was about to leave.  
  
"It may be impossible for us. But if we do nothing, that beast will
continue to rampage. That's unacceptable."  
"Then what do you propose?"  
"That…"  
  
What Kyle-san says is true, but we can't do anything without a means.  
  
"Now then, wait a moment. Tsubaki, you have a moral obligation to grant
my wish."  
"Even so, I can't grant an impossible wish."  
"That's not a problem. I know of a hero."  
"There's a hero!?"  
"Yes. So, first, let's find that person."  
  
So, to defeat the red beast, we need to find a hero. Speaking of
which…  
  
"I know of a hero as well."  
"Ho, Chloe has met that person too?"  
"Maybe a hero? I met him…um, anyway, please look at this."  
  
I took out the sword I picked up that time. I think its name was…  
  
"Isn't that the Greatsword Rex? Chloe-dono, where did you get this?"  
"I picked it up."  
  
I'm not lying. I wasn't lying. I just accidentally picked it up. I was
planning to return it, so this is a good opportunity.  
Even so, Tsubaki-san is awfully interested in this sword. Does she want
to become a hero? Only the chosen one can wield this.  
  
"Kakkakka. This, even I didn't know."  
"……Chloe-san, are you a hero?"  
"No, no. Right, Chloe?"  
"Yes, that's right. I just picked this up."  
  
I almost became a hero, but I'm not one. If I were a hero, I would be
able to use this sword.  
  
"But… I thought that boy had it. Well, no matter. I have to find the
wielder of that sword anyway. Now, let me ask again, will you grant my
wish?"  
  
《Quest: Defeat the Red Beast: Defeat the red beast that suddenly
appeared in the Twilight Forest.》  
  
"Of course, I'll accept."  
"……I will accept as well."  
  
The two look at me. Niru, Earl, and Haku are also looking at me.  
  
"Well, we can't leave the beast alone. Besides… I owe it a debt."  
  
I intended to accept. I mean, we're fellow witches. I couldn't refuse.
And I also chased the black cat around.  
  
…Speaking of which, usually Niru would react in situations like this,
but Niru isn't looking at her with suspicion. Does that mean she isn't
lying? There are many things bothering me.
