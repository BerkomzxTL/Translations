"Thank you very much!"  
  
I sent off the person who bought a potion with a grateful smile. It's
only been a few minutes since I started selling potions at the entrance
to the \[Twilight Forest\]. As I expected, the potions sold like
hotcakes. Everyone must have been struggling with a potion shortage. By
the way, the price is the same as potions sold in town. Normally, since
there are no shops in this location, I could have overcharged, but that
would probably have given players a bad impression of me.  
  
I've been ripped off before, so I know how it feels. Doing something
like that might attract unwanted attention. PvP can happen anywhere,
anytime. In this game, you can attack other players anywhere, even in
town. Well, in town there are soldiers and such, so there's a risk of
being caught immediately if you attack someone, so it's relatively safe…
but that doesn't mean there aren't safe places. Inns and important bases
are designated as safe zones.  
  
So is PvP rampant? It's… normal, I guess? I haven't met anyone like that
yet. Maybe because it's still an early-game area?  
  
…No, maybe I've been unintentionally involved in PvP without even
realizing it. In this game, it's hard to tell the difference between
players and NPCs. And players can be anything. In fact, the race
selection included monsters. In other words… among the beings I've
fought so far, there might have been players. I don't know about
monsters, but the most likely candidates are the village chief of that
village or that Devil-chan… well, the truth is unknown.  
  
Anyway, it's better for both sides to avoid unnecessary trouble. At
least I'm making more profit than selling to Miranda-san.  
  
And soon, my merchandise was gone. I sold everything for 33,500G.
Incredible! I've already earned over 30,000G. I can buy that new
staff!  
  
I can't stay here. I want to go and buy that staff quickly. I could make
more potions and sell them, but the staff comes first. That black staff.
Currently, it's the best staff I can equip and has a great design. If I
don't hurry, someone might buy it like my previous armor, you know? So
let's hurry to town.  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
"Hehehe..."  
  
I can't stop grinning. Ah, this slightly purplish black color is so
nice. The blue stone at the tip reflects the light and shines
brilliantly. Beautiful…  
  
\[Black Sorcerer's Staff: Magic Attack +50: A standard mage's staff made
from a magically charged branch and stone. Unlike typical mage's staffs,
it is black.\]  
  
It's worth the 30,000G. I'm glad I bought it. After that, I rushed to
the weapon shop and successfully bought it without any problem. I feel
like I've taken another step closer to becoming a true witch.  
  
"Niru, look! I got a new staff this time."  
  
Niru was still asleep on my shoulder. After I called him, he opened his
eyes and looked at my new staff. Then, before I knew it, he flew off my
shoulder and tried to perch on the tip of the staff. But the staff's
decorations were in the way, making it a bit difficult to land.  
  
"…I'm not changing it. I just got it, so I'm not changing it."  
  
So Niru, don't look at me with that dissatisfied expression. I'll let
you sit on my shoulder.  
  
Now then, since I got a new staff, I want to test it out. It's night, so
it's perfect for fighting. Having decided that, I started to head
outside…  
  
"Meow"  
  
Cat. I heard a cat's meow. I turned around, and there was a black cat at
the end of the alleyway. We stared at each other for a while, but the
cat moved first and ran further into the alley.  
  
"Wait!"  
  
I hurried after it, but the cat was much faster. It disappeared from
sight in an instant.  
  
"Niru, please."  
  
I can't keep up with it. But Niru can fly. And maybe because my
summoning skill has improved, I can now see what Niru can see.  
  
Niru's vision appears in a window on my screen. Of course, I can also
switch my vision to Niru's. Thanks to that, I was able to quickly find
the cat from above.  
  
"This time… this time, I'll make a contract."  
  
A black cat familiar is necessary for the next step in my goal of
becoming a witch.  
  
…I ran all over town, but I couldn't catch the black cat. That black cat
was incredibly agile. It makes me want it as a familiar all the more.  
  
"…"  
  
Niru, what is it? That cold gaze again… but this time it's different?
It's a bit…sad? Oh, maybe—  
  
"Do you dislike me getting a new familiar?"  
  
When I asked that, he turned his head to the side, looking away.  
  
"It's not like I'm getting a new familiar because you're unreliable."  
  
This is all because of my goal of becoming the ideal witch. Role-play is
important, but starting with the outward appearance is also a good idea.
That's why I react to anything that seems witch-like.  
  
Niru certainly sleeps when he can, but he does his job properly. When I
told him that, he turned his head back. And then he went to sleep.
…Don't fall asleep right away just because you were reassured. Well,
that's Niru for you.  
  
Oh well… I chased that black cat around so much that it's already
morning. Fighting is impossible now. Are they still suffering from a
potion shortage in the \[Twilight Forest\]? If so, that's another chance
for business. So let's head over there right away.  
  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
  
Should I say I was too naive? No, I know that others must have come to
the same conclusion as me, so this situation was inevitable.  
  
I'm now in the \[Twilight Forest\]. I made some potions to sell again,
but when I tried to, I noticed something. It seems there was another
potion seller. They were overcharging, but when I showed up, the
customers flocked to me. There were no other merchants. It's been a
while since I first sold there, but that overcharging merchant seemed to
be the only one around.  
  
As I was thinking that, another potion seller appeared. As time passed,
their number increased. All of them seemed less like merchants and more
like people capable of producing potions. Ah, considering the time it
takes to prepare them, it makes sense that only the overcharging
merchant was there. Other production professions, unless they have a
skill like my \[Camping\] that allows for outdoor production, need to
return to town before they can produce anything. The overcharging
merchant must have been reselling potions bought in town.  
  
So, what happens in a market with many shops? Of course, a price war.  
  
The prices were lowered more and more, and before long, potions could be
bought for 100G. Now, even people who couldn't clear the \[Twilight
Forest\] were coming here because it was cheaper than in town.  
  
But my place was still better. This was probably because I was selling
antidotes. However, I don't know where they heard about it, but a new
shop opened that stocked not only potions but also antidotes for poison,
paralysis, and sleepiness. There was no way I could win against this
store, which was probably run by a high-level player. Neither I nor the
person selling potions across the street, glaring at me...  
  
That's the end of the story of the small economy that circulated in the
\[Twilight Forest\].  
  
At least I achieved my goal of getting a new weapon, so that's good. The
problem is what to do with the remaining potion stock…
