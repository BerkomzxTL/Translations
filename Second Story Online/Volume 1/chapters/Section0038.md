# 38・The Black Cat's Wish

It's a small, one-story house. In the room just inside the entrance,
there is a set of wooden furniture, including a table and chairs. From
the appearance of the room, it's clear that only one person lives
here.  
  
However, the windows were closed, making the room dimly lit. The
furniture is covered in dust, as if the room hasn't been used for
years.  
  
In the middle of that dimly lit room, a black cat was waiting on the
table.  
  
*'It seems you'll listen to my request. Now then... let's get this place
cleaned first.'*  
"Cleaning?"  
*'As you can see, this room is covered in dust.'*  
  
A broom flew in from somewhere. I instinctively picked it up. Everyone
else had cleaning supplies as well: Earl had a dustpan, Kyle-san had a
rag and a bucket, and Tsubaki-san had a feather duster.  
  
*'Please do your best. Try to finish as quickly as possible.'*  
  
《Quest: The Black Cat's Wish: Fulfill the black cat's wish.》  
  
The black cat meowed as the quest was displayed. It washed its face as
if it had returned to its original state. If I were to talk to it now, I
doubt it would understand.  
  
*'...I remember. This is the location of that quest.'*  
*'Do you know something?'*  
  
I couldn't help but look at Kyle-san.  
  
*'This is the house of the client for a certain quest. The details were
to clean the room. It was a good money-making quest for beginners, and
it was popular among the first-group members.'*  
*'I've never heard of it.'*  
*'Well, this quest became unavailable around the start of the second
group. The reason is unknown. I tried it once, but I couldn't accept it
then...'*  
*'But isn't that the quest we just accepted?'*  
*'No, it's a little different. The client for the previous quest was an
old woman, not a black cat.'*  
*'I see.'*  
  
Something similar happened in Berry Village. Though the client was the
same in that case.  
  
"Anyway, let's just put aside the reason why we're cleaning and get
started. I've chased it around before, too."  
"I have no objections."  
"Of course, I'll help."  
  
Earl nodded in agreement. Niru seems to have no intention of helping and
planned to sleep somewhere out of the way. Haku, Tsubaki-san's familiar,
seemed willing to help.  
  
"Oh, that's right. Earl, you use this broom."  
  
I handed Earl the broom I was holding. A dustpan alone wouldn't be
enough to clean. I don't need to worry.  
  
"I have my own broom."  
  
I'm glad I have my own broom. It's for flying (eventually).  
So, we divided the work and cleaned the room. Tsubaki-san and Haku used
the feather duster to remove the dust that had accumulated on the
bookshelves and other surfaces. Kyle-san wiped down the tables and so on
with a rag.  
  
"I'm sorry. I can't pay attention to you right now."  
  
At Kyle-san's feet was the black cat. It seemed a little dejected as it
left Kyle-san's side. But it soon headed off to a certain place.  
  
As for Niru, he was sleeping out of the way. However, the black cat,
having left Kyle-san's side, began to bother Niru. Please don't look at
me with such a dissatisfied expression just because you can't sleep.  
  
Earl and I used brooms to clean the floor. Earl seemed to be enjoying
the cleaning. Does he like cleaning?  
  
While watching Earl, I tried to put a book that had fallen on the floor
back on the shelf.  
  
"Ah, this is..."  
  
I recognized the book. It's the magic textbook I used when I was
learning magic skills from the Skill Master. It seems to be an
apprentice's book on fire magic.  
On closer inspection, the bookshelf contained all kinds of apprentice's
books. The other books also seemed to be related to magic. The author is
the same, a person named Lucille.  
  
*‘What are you stopping for?'*  
"Wa-"  
  
When I turned around, the black cat was there. Don't scare me like
that.  
  
*'Are you so interested in that book?'*  
"Yes. ...Well, to be exact, I'm not interested in the book, but in
you."  
  
Kyle-san said the owner of this house was an old woman. And there are
multiple spellbooks on this shelf. From this, it's likely that the owner
of this house was an old woman who was a magician.  
That would make the black cat a familiar. Meaning it could share its
vision. Someone could also speak through it.  
And these books written by this Lucille... well, there's a possibility
that it's just a coincidence that they have the same books.  
  
Anyway, I think I now know the black cat's identity.  
  
*'Kakakaka. So you've already noticed. Alright, we're done cleaning.
Come over here.'*  
  
The black cat jumped and touched one of the books on the shelf. The
bookshelf then began to move. A hidden door behind the bookshelf
appeared.  
  
*'Wow, this has become something weird again…'*  
*'Ah, so that's it. That means...'*  
*'Yeah. Looks like we've been dragged into \*that\* again.'*  
  
I made eye contact with Kyle-san. This is the second time.  
  
The black cat meowed. As if to say, 'Open up.' Your owner is on the
other side, aren't they?  
Turning to Kyle-san and Tsubaki-san, they both nodded silently. I slowly
opened the hidden door.
