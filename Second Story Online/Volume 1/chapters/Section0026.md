# 26・One Should Possess...

“You can't escape from me!”  
  
I was running pretty well, but… she caught up with me. When I stopped
and turned around, she appeared from the shadows. As a cat beastkin, she
was very agile, so there was no way I could escape her.  
  
“Why were you running? Did you try to escape because you were at a
disadvantage?”  
  
I wasn't doing that. I was choosing a location. Besides… the chase made
for perfect timing.  
  
“Not answering… uh, in this kind of situation—I'll, uh, defeat you and
take your money! That's, that's alright… ugh, it's hard to talk like a
bandit!"  
  
…I think it's better not to try and sound like a bandit.  
  
Well, I feel bad for her, but I'll cast the \[Dark Bind\] I'd prepared.
It doesn't have as long a casting time as \[Dark Burst\], so it's nice
that I can activate it after buying a little time.  
  
“Urgh… a restraint status…”  
  
Bound by dark chains, she couldn't move. I need to hurry before that
priest cancels it, so I began casting the next spell.  
  
Oh right, let me answer your question. The reason I moved from that
place. That spot didn't have any view of the sky, and I just thought
that if I was going to fight, it would be better to fight somewhere
where I could see the sky...the moon.  
  
“Wha…”  
  
Light began to shine in this previously dark place. Even in the forest,
this spot doesn't have leaves covering the sky. The stars shine
brightly, and the moon is visible.  
  
“Why… Bluey! —! —!? What's happening!?”  
  
Her eyes are looking to the right... from her perspective, is it to the
left? The chains that restrained her disappeared as their effect wore
off.  
  
Simultaneously, I finished casting the \[Shadow Arrow\]. It hit her.
It's night now. The effects of \[Moonlight\] and \[Rebellion\] seem to
be working, but she's still not down.  
  
“…I don't understand much, but right now, the enemy's in front of me!”  
  
I don't know how much damage the Shadow Arrow did, but she attacked
me.  
  
“\[Double Slash\]!”  
  
A series of powerful attacks hit my body. My HP is critically low. If
even a little attack hits, it'll be zero. The next attack came at me
without a moment's hesitation. With this, my HP should be depleted...
right?  
  
“…\[Air Shock\]!”  
  
A compressed mass of air hit her directly. There's no way she can avoid
it, since she was right up close to attack me.  
  
“No way… why… why aren't you dead?"  
  
It seems I still have HP left. She took some distance from me and looked
at me in surprise.  
  
“Because I used a potion. Isn't that obvious?”  
  
I only had a little HP left, but I managed to recover it before the next
attack, so it didn't reach zero.  
  
“Where did you get that potion? You weren't sprinkling it.”  
“I drank it. I had it in my mouth.”  
  
While I was running.  
  
“Such a disgusting thing…”  
“Oh, there are delicious potions in the world, you know.”  
  
If it tasted bad, I would spit it out the moment I put it in my mouth,
or swallow it immediately. I can't stand that taste.  
  
But if it tastes good, I can keep it in my mouth. And when I want to use
it, like during battle, I can drink it to recover.  
  
I was a bit worried whether I could use a potion like that. I remembered
that when I drank a bad-tasting one, it took a while for the effect to
take place, so I tried it when I used one earlier. As a result, it seems
that the effect doesn't take place unless I swallow it.  
  
“Well then, shall I at least defeat you? ...This is a thank you for
pushing me this far.”  
  
Casting a spell――eh?  
  
“…Arrow”  
  
The cat-eared girl in front of me. An arrowhead was visible from her
chest. In an instant, the arrow passed through her, and then pierced my
chest.  
  
…My HP decreased. I haven't recovered from the cat-eared girl's attack
yet, so my HP is almost depleted. One more hit and I'll die.  
  
“Saval!”  
  
Behind her was her companion, the elf youth, who I thought hadn't
appeared for quite some time.  
  
Ah, seriously. They don't receive attacks from party members, especially
ranged attacks and magic, they just pass through. And since he was right
behind her, I couldn't see the sniper. I let my guard down because of
it.  
  
“Let's retreat, Azi! This is too much for us… guh!”  
  
At that moment, I saw an object dive-bombing from above his head. A
white bird. It looks like an owl, with long ear tufts. However, it was
much bigger than my partner.  
  
Then it seemed to be enveloped in smoke, and instead, a black shadow
fell towards the elf. It seems he received an attack from the fallen
shadow, and his body, enveloped in a light effect, disappeared.  
  
“…Yu—”  
“I'm sorry to interrupt your surprise, but it's your turn next.”  
  
I jabbed the tip of my staff into the forehead of the cat-eared girl who
turned around. Or rather, I didn't let her say anything more. His
headache would only get worse. With the \[Shadow Arrow\] incantation
completed in the meantime, I unleashed it. This time, she finally ran
out of HP and disappeared, following after the elf.  
  
Well then, the only one left is me… no, that's not quite right. To be
precise, there are two people and one creature.  
  
“It's been a long time. I didn't expect to meet you like this,
Tsubaki-san.”  
  
This is the second time I've seen her face illuminated by moonlight. She
nodded in response to my greeting. Haku descended from the sky next to
Tsubaki-san. Did she use a skill to switch places with Haku just now?  
  
“The other people, did Tsubaki-san…?”  
  
She nodded again. Apparently, while I was playing tag with the cat-eared
girl, she was dealing with the other two. Now I understand why she was
looking to her left. She must have been surprised that her party members
suddenly died.  
  
“Thank you for saving me.”  
“…I didn't save you.”  
  
She shakes her head from side to side, refusing my thanks.  
  
“I merely carried out my mission. That is all.”  
“But you still saved me.”  
"If that had been my intention, I would have interfered from the
beginning, wouldn't I?"  
“…………So you were there from the start?”  
  
Apparently, it wasn't just the three of them who were sneaking around.
The reason I couldn't find Tsubaki-san was either because she was
outside my detection range, or maybe Tsubaki-san's level is very high.  
  
Even for Tsubaki-san, who seems to be high level, it must have been
difficult to deal with three people. In other words, I unknowingly acted
as bait.  
  
“But, I'll thank you anyway.”  
“…Do as you please.”  
  
Saying that, she turned away.  
  
"However, you are quite something yourself. To declare, ‘Begone!' and
challenge three opponents to a fight…"  
  
…Wait. I don't remember saying “begone”… could it have been then? When I
said, “Please step aside”?… It's possible.  
  
Perhaps I meant to say “Please step aside,” but because of my still
unstable language skills, it became a different word.  
  
“Unfortunately, I only managed to defeat one person, but next time I'll
make sure I can do it."  
  
…Well, it's fine. It's not a problem from Chloe's perspective. It might
even be quite like her.  
  
"You're a frighteningly capable person."  
  
Muttering that, Tsubaki-san disappeared into the dark night. Haku also
quickly flew away and disappeared. Tsubaki-san really does exude
coolness. Haku has also grown even bigger.  
  
“Oh, I forgot about Niru!”  
  
I hurriedly called up the familiar's screen and resummoned him. Niru,
looking sleepy and yawning, appeared as if nothing happened. He's still
as small as ever.  
  
“He seems fine.”  
  
Seeing that made me feel like my heart had calmed down.
