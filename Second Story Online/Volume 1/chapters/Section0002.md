# 2・Witches Take Priority Over Heroes

"Welcome to Second Story Online"  
  
When I logged in, I was greeted with a system message.  
I reflexively bowed slightly, already feeling my body moving within the
game.  
Before me spread a beautiful flower field, petals fluttering in the
breeze.  
The clear lake in front was also stunning, its blue surface mirroring
the sky.  
The scenery was so realistic it felt like I was somewhere overseas, not
in a game.  
  
But I will say one thing.  
…Why is the SSO title logo positioned directly above the lake?  
Its presence is overwhelmingly huge, and why did the developers put it
there?  
  
As I gazed at the unrealistically beautiful scene, a system message
appeared.  
It’s an explanation of the character creation process.  
Following the instructions, I began the initial setup.  
Let's get started!  
  
I'd already decided on my appearance.  
Long black hair. Green eyes.  
I'll make my face younger than my real one, and make the facial features
fit this worldview. I'll keep my height and build the same for ease of
movement  
I thought an old woman would be fine as a witch, but this is a game
after all. Please forgive me.  
  
So, I ended up creating a character that looks more like a magical girl
than a witch.  
…I made her too young. Oh well, it’s pointless to make her too close to
my real self.  
Now, the next step is to choose the name of this character. There is no
particular difficulty in choosing it. I type in Chloe.  
  
Next, birth and background settings. This is unusual compared to other
games.  
You determine where your character grew up and what kind of life they've
led so far.  
This setting affects learnable skills, NPC interactions, and quests and
events.  
  
This is probably the biggest selling point of this game.  
It’s called Second Story for a reason.  
  
Yeah, it seems like there are a lot of role-players in this game.  
Most of the remaining early access players are supposedly
role-players.  
This was convenient since I plan to role-play as a witch.  
  
People who value character creation emphasize this part, while hardcore
players focus on parameters affected by each item.  
I'm definitely in the former group. Although, I'm only a casual
role-player.  
  
First of all, I glanced at the birth category. There are a lot of
options just for birth... Sheep herder, farmer, clothing store, etc.  
The fact that there are so many settings available is probably the
reason why there are so many role-players.  
  
Which one should I choose? Hmm? A random button?  
Come to think of it, I think I saw on a strategy site that choosing
randomly might give you something rare.  
Apparently you can change it just once, so let's give it a try!  
  
\[Random Birth Result: Viscount Bradley Family\]  
  
…Viscount family? I think that's quite rare.  
A noble, huh? I don't intend to role-play as a noble, but I'll use it
anyway.  
Next is the career background…let's go random here as well.  
This can also be changed once. Role-playing a randomly generated
character might be fun.  
  
\[Random Career Background: Chosen as a Hero\]  
  
Rejected. It might be rare, but rejected!  
I said randomly generated characters might be fun, but I'm a witch, not
a hero!  
I immediately clicked random again.  
  
\[Random Career Background: Ran away from home and went on a journey\]  
  
Ran away from home, huh? Ran away from the Viscount family, huh?  
  
She probably ran away to become a witch. I get it.  
I can't change it anymore, so this is final. I guess she turned out to
be a surprisingly easy character to work with.  
I wonder what would have happened if I'd become a hero…  
Maybe I would have become a demon lord. Ah, how scary.  
  
Alright, let's focus and move on to the next step.  
  
Next is skill selection.  
This determines the special skills that the character has. Skills can be
acquired by spending points.  
  
Then, by taking action based on that knowledge, your skills will grow.  
The number of skills that can be acquired increases depending on the
player's actions.  
  
If I'm going to be a witch, I need magic, of course. Then alchemy? I
want a familiar, so summoning magic… alright!  
  
\[Two-Handed Staff\]\[Dark Magic\]\[Wind Magic\]\[Magic
Knowledge\]\[Magic Power\]\[Alchemy\]\[Summoning:
Familiar\]\[Command\]  
  
I can apparently have ten at the start, but I'll save some points for
later.  
It seems the remaining points can be used later.  
  
Additionally, skills are granted based on birth and background.  
  
And with that, the lengthy character creation is over.  
All that's left is to decide your initial starting position… but mine is
random due to my background.  
Originally, it would be the Viscount family's location, but it seems the
background forcibly changed it.  
Ah, it looks like it'll just be one of the initial starting locations.  
  
So I press the start button.  
  
"Have a wonderful journey. Enjoy your own story."  
  
A system message echoed, and my view gradually faded away into a blocky,
noisy light.  
The flower field, the lake, and that logo…I'll miss it a little, but it
can't be helped. The story won't start if I stay here.  
  
—Now then, into the world of SSO. The story of the witch Chloe begins!
