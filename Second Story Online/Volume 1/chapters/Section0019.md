# 19・The Essence of a Role-Player

"Welcome,"  
  
Entering my usual general store, I was greeted by the usual voice… huh?
It was different. That wasn't the usual fluffy shopkeeper's voice, but a
boy's voice. Did she go through puberty? Looking at the counter, the
usual shopkeeper wasn't there; instead, a boy was standing there.  
  
"Um, where's Miranda-san?"  
"The manager is out right now."  
  
It seems the shopkeeper, Miranda-san, is currently out. Since she's
always at the counter, I was a little taken aback.  
  
"Do you need something from the manager?"  
"No… I'd like to sell some items, if possible."  
"Yes, that's fine."  
  
The boy working the counter answered with a smile. I sold him the items
I'd gotten from the recent epic quest. Mostly goblin and orc drops.  
After selling everything, I got 23,000G. …Good, I can get new
equipment.  
  
"I'm home~! I'm back~! Oh, Chloe-chan, you're here~!"  
  
The shopkeeper entered, opening the door. She took the counter from the
boy, who then retreated to the back of the store.  
  
"Is that boy an employee here?"  
"……Ten-ten?"  
  
…The language barrier strikes again when you least expect it. After
rephrasing it, she understood. When will I be able to speak fluently?  
  
"Ah, yes, he's my employee. Well, technically, he's a retainer."  
"A retainer? So, he's a butler?"  
  
Hearing "retainer," that's the image that comes to mind. From Chloe's
perspective, as a former noble, that's how she would perceive their
existence.  
  
"Ahaha~ Do I look like a noble lady?"  
"Not at all."  
"You don't have to say it so bluntly…"  
  
She continued, though she didn't seem disappointed.  
  
"He's not a butler. He's a worker hired with a \[Servant Contract\].
Depending on the contents of the contract, I think there are servants
who act as butlers just like Chloe-chan said. But I hired this boy to
help out in the shop."  
"I see."  
  
Just a part-time worker then. It's just hiring someone, but when you
implement that as a game system, it probably ends up looking like
this.  
  
"Want a retainer, Chloe-chan? Unlike me, you look like some kind of
queen (young lady)…"  
  
My language skill messed up again. What does "queen" even mean? If it's
going to make a mistake, it should at least have made it "witch".  
  
"…Well, having one wouldn't be such a bad thing."  
  
Chloe, a former noble lady, is now in such a remote area. She must have
gone through a lot, so she's not the type who can't do anything without
a maid. However, remembering her time as a noble, she probably would
want at least one maid.  
  
"A \[Servant Contract\] costs 3,000G~"  
  
She said with a fluffy smile. …Miranda-san, you're a shrewd
businesswoman.  
  
  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
  
  
Now that I've left the general store, my next destination is the armory.
I remember the way perfectly, so it's okay. Even if I didn't, I have the
\[Local Knowledge\] skill.  
  
The bell chimed as I opened the door to the armory. The taciturn
shopkeeper at the counter glanced at me but didn't say a word.  
  
Let's find the armor I had my eye on. I walked through the shop, which
still had no other customers. Is this place doing okay? I'm a little
worried.  
  
"Found it! A pointed hat!"  
  
The first thing I picked up was a pointed hat. That's it. When you say
witch, you think of a pointed hat. A witch in a hooded robe is also
charming, but this pointed hat is nice too. Now for the armor. Let's
find what I had my eye on.  
  
…This is strange. It was here last time, but I can't find it now. Is
this not the right place? Let's look elsewhere.  
  
"…What are you doing?"  
"Hii!"  
  
The shopkeeper spoke to me. I'm sure I looked like a thief or something
while searching through the store.  
  
"Um… do you know where the mage's armor is? Black, long-skirted…"  
"It's sold."  
"Then do you have something similar?"  
"No."  
  
What?! I can't believe there were other customers at this armory besides
me! Oh, excuse me. Apparently, this armory is surprisingly successful.
But someone bought the equipment I was aiming for! Could there be
someone else aiming to be a witch?  
  
"…Are you going to buy that?"  
  
The shopkeeper pointed at the pointed hat.  
  
"Yes."  
"What's your budget?"  
"I'm fine. I have 10,000G."  
"No, your budget for a whole outfit."  
"Eh? I was thinking 20,000G including this hat, but…"  
  
As I answered, the shopkeeper walked into the back of the store. He came
back carrying several pieces of armor from the pile of goods. Then he
pressed them into my hands.  
  
"The fitting room's over there."  
"Y-yes…"  
  
The store owner, who was an unexpectedly large man, glared at me, and I
ran off to the fitting room. What was going on… I tried on the equipment
I was given.  
  
"…This is…"  
  
In the mirror, I looked exactly like a witch. A black and white, almost
gothic lolita-style dress that matched perfectly with the pointed hat.  
  
"But…this…"  
  
Unlike the noble lady's dress, this outfit's skirt is short. The
absolute territory between the skirt and the knee socks is dazzling.
When I opened the curtain and left the fitting room, the shopkeeper was
back behind the counter.  
  
"Changed?"  
"Yes. But…"  
  
I don't dislike this outfit. But the skirt is a little short…I don't
really want to wear it. I used to wear something similar when I was
younger, but…  
  
"…I thought it would suit you."  
  
The shopkeeper said in a small voice. …Yes, that's right. It suits me.
This shopkeeper has quite a good fashion sense. This outfit suits Chloe,
and it's cute and witch-like. —Chloe would wear it, I'm sure. …There's
no helping it.  
  
"Um, I'll buy this."  
  
If it suits Chloe and I think she'd buy it, then I have to… because I am
a witch, and I am Chloe.
