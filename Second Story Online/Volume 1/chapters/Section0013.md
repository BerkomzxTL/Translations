# 13・Encountering A Comrade

We are currently in the \[Twilight Forest\]. It's gotten dark since the
sun went down, but it's not too bad thanks to my \[Night Vision\] skill.
And this is deeper than the entrance. It's a place I've never been to
before.  
  
"Chloe-dono, no enemies around, it is safe."  
  
I can hear a voice from the top of a nearby tree. It's the young ninja
who prostrated herself before me earlier. Her name is Tsubaki-san.  
  
"Was there no owl?"  
"…No owl."  
  
A slightly disappointed voice came through the party chat. Apparently,
Tsubaki-san wants to tame a \[Twilight Owl\], which appears in this
forest. That's why she called out to me, since I have Niru, another
\[Twilight Owl\].  
  
Unfortunately, my Niru is a familiar. But we are both summoning
monsters. I think the way familiars and tamers work is a little
different, but I thought I could help out a bit, so that's why I'm
helping Tsubaki-san out here. I'm also a role-player, after all.  
  
Tsubaki-san seems to be a role-player as well. Her equipment and speech
pattern suggest she's playing a ninja. Otherwise, she'd be a real ninja
in real life.  
  
"Chloe-dono, next, we explore east."  
"East, huh… It looks like \[Twilight Fungus\] appears in the east so be
careful."  
"Understood, Chloe-dono. I know this forest better than you. And I'm not
lost yet."  
"Well, I'm pretty good at figuring out directions."  
  
I've never been in this forest before, though. My ability to not get
lost is due to the \[Local Knowledge\] skill. And maybe it's also thanks
to Niru. Niru tells me things I don't know in a non-verbal way, like
there's a certain monster in that direction and that thing over there.
Maybe it's the effect of \[Forest Sage\]?  
  
"By the way, Tsubaki-san, why do you want to catch an owl?"  
  
In my case, it was a spontaneous decision. I decided to make Niru my
familiar during our sudden battle. But Tsubaki-san decided to tame an
owl from the start. Does she have some attachment to them?  
  
"…Because I like owls."  
  
…A simple answer. I see, you like them, so you want them to be your
friend. I kind of get it. I also really want that black cat to become my
familiar.  
  
"Enemy approaching."  
  
Tsubaki-san's voice made me turn forward. There are mushroom monsters a
little distance away. Three of them, I think.  
  
"Chloe-dono, like before."  
"Understood."  
  
Hearing my reply, Tsubaki-san disappears without a sound. I closed the
distance as much as possible before the mushrooms would notice me. Then
I started casting a spell.  
  
After a while, Tsubaki-san appeared behind one mushroom. She slashed at
it from behind with her sword, and the mushroom went down with a single
blow. She must be using a technique that increases in power with
surprise attacks.  
  
Well then, I'll make my move too. As the remaining mushrooms spot me, I
have Niru generate \[Dark Mist\]. The affected mushrooms release spores.
Apparently, inhaling them causes \[Paralysis\]. But Tsubaki-san is
already out of the spore range, and so am I.  
  
I unleashed my \[Dark Burst\] on the mushrooms. It hit them, but they
still have a little HP left. Even at night, with the \[Rebellion\]
effect activated, they're still higher level than me. They don't go down
that easily.  
  
The rest was easy though. Tsubaki-san could take them down with a single
blow each while they were stumbling around in the \[Darkness\].  
  
However, Tsubaki-san and I have very different fighting styles. Maybe
it's because I don't like sneak attacks. I prefer to fight more openly,
but ninjas don't do that, so it can't be helped.  
  
"Chloe-dono?"  
"Oh… It's nothing. Thanks for helping with the cleanup, Tsubaki-san."  
"It's my pleasure. Chloe-dono, thanks to you, today was much easier."  
  
Tsubaki-san is a higher level than me, yet she's thanking me. I may be
low level, but I can output high damage at night, and I'm good at
leading the way without getting lost. I suppose those two things earned
her gratitude.  
  
"Thank you. But our goal was to catch an owl, right?"  
"……That's right!"  
  
Apparently she had been concentrating on the battle and had forgotten
her original objective. Tsubaki-san frantically scanned her surroundings
for an owl.  
  
"Tsubaki-san!?"  
  
Suddenly, Tsubaki-san leapt onto a tree. I'm surprised by her sudden
action.  
  
"Found… an owl!"  
  
Finally! She ran along the branches, so I followed. When I caught up,
Tsubaki-san and the owl were glaring at each other.  
  
"Chloe-dono, I want to hear about your capturing techniques."  
  
I had given Tsubaki-san advice on capturing techniques. I guess she
wants to hear it again to be sure.  
  
"First, let them know your strength. Otherwise, they won't listen."  
  
I think that means reducing their HP by half. Well, I'm a familiar user,
not a tamer.  
  
I can see Tsubaki-san's attacks chipping away at the owl's health.  
  
"Tsubaki-san, I think that's enough."  
  
Hearing me, Tsubaki-san immediately puts distance between herself and
the owl. Its HP is sufficiently reduced, so that's enough.  
  
"Is it alright to capture it?"  
"Yes. Please put your heart into it."  
"Heart…"  
  
While wary of the owl's attacks, Tsubaki-san approached and activated
her \[Capture\] skill. Tamers' \[Capture\] can be used even without the
target's consent. The chances of it working improve as you level up.
However...I don't think it's completely unrelated to the creature's
feelings.  
  
The light of the capture magic circle enveloped the owl and then
disappeared. The owl that had fallen flew up and landed on Tsubaki-san's
arm.  
  
"Chloe-dono! I caught it!"  
  
An excited Tsubaki-san came running over with the owl. Ah, she
succeeded. When I made my familiar contract, Niru's form disappeared for
a moment, so I thought it would be the same. It seems that it's
different for tamers.  
  
"That's great."  
"Yes! All thanks to Chloe-dono!"  
  
She's extremely happy. But this level of joy feels a bit out of
character. Until now, Tsubaki-san was more cool and ninja-like… Both
during the prostration and now, her true personality is showing.  
  
"Ah… excuse me...de gozaru."  
  
Noticing this, Tsubaki-san calmed herself down and hid her bright red
face with the scarf around her neck.  
  
"Let's leave the forest for now."  
  
I silently nodded in agreement. Yes, this is more like the Tsubaki-san I
know.  
  
As we left the \[Twilight Forest\], the warm sunlight greeted us. Night
has long since passed. Once we reached the plains and were safe,
Tsubaki-san immediately started naming the owl she caught.  
  
"…Haku."  
  
She seems to have decided on the name Haku. Haku, perched on
Tsubaki-san's arm, seems to reply happily. …But Haku is huge. She's the
same size as a \[Twilight Owl\], far larger than Niru.  
  
"Can I try something?"  
  
I want to try something, so I have Tsubaki-san put Haku on the ground.
Then I place Niru on top of Haku. The size difference is so great that
Niru can easily sit on Haku. Both are a greyish-white, making them look
like kagami mochi.  
  
"…Cute."  
  
Tsubaki-san next to me is trembling slightly. Should I take a picture?
I've already taken one, of course.  
  
Ah… Niru, don't be discouraged. It can't be helped; Haku is a pet and
you're a familiar. Just accept the size difference.  
  
"Chloe-dono, I thank you. If you're in trouble, call me."  
  
Tsubaki-san said that to me as she left. Thank you.  
  
"See you again sometime."  
  
She nodded once at my words and left, of course, with her new companion,
Haku. Haku was flying gracefully through the bright daytime sky,
following Tsubaki-san.  
  
"Hey, Niru. Can't you be active during the daytime like that too?"  
  
I asked Niru, but he was asleep on my shoulder. He turned his head 180
degrees, avoiding eye contact.  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TN: ‘de gozaru' is an old term used by samurai for politeness. Tsubaki
uses it for role-playing. Not sure how to accurately convey it in
english but it's safe to just append ‘de gozaru' to pretty much
everything Tsuabki says except when she breaks character
