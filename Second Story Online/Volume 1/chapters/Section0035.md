# 35・The Gold-Plated Group

I waited until night and then arrived at the Twilight Forest. There were
no more people trying to conquer this forest, and it feels quite lonely.
But perhaps this silence is normal.  
  
Bandits, the events of the White Forest, and that mysteriously strong
monster. Walking through the forest, which has become more dangerous
than before, is quite thrilling. Well, as long as I don't approach the
White Forest, I should be fine. I encountered that strong monster there,
after all. If I run into any bandits, I'll just consider myself
unlucky.  
  
"Earl, be careful. If you're bitten by that spider, you'll receive a
powerful poison."  
  
As I walked through the forest, I immediately encountered monsters. This
time, three spiders appeared at once. This is probably also due to the
lack of people.  
  
"Niru, provide support from the air. Earl, just lure them; you don't
need to attack."  
  
I gave instructions to both of them. Niru flew into the sky and
monitored the enemy's status. He was on standby so he could fire Dark
Mist whenever necessary. I equipped Earl with a shield and a club.  
  
First, let's immobilize them. While Earl was luring them, I cast \[Dark
Bind\]. Thanks to the level-up effect of \[Dark Magic\], the restraint
time increased to ten seconds. I cast it immediately after it was ready.
All three ended up bound by dark chains and became immobile. \[Dark
Bind\] also deals damage. Since my level has gone up, the damage is
quite good.  
  
I immediately cast \[Shadow Arrow\] at one of them. I chanted it along
with \[Dark Bind\] using the \[Double Cast\] effect. Being able to move
to an attack immediately after immobilizing them is nice.  
I then finished that one off with \[Wind Cutter\]. Two more to go.  
  
The effect of \[Dark Bind\] is still active. In the meantime, I started
preparing the next spell. Let's try the newly learned \[Shadow Magic\]
spell, \[Drain\], along with \[Sand Spear\].  
  
Meanwhile, the spider I was aiming for attacked me with a ball of
thread. Since I'm already chanting two spells, I can't activate my
defensive skill \[Wind Shield\]. I'll have to take the hit.  
  
Ah, the damage hurts. And I was hit with the \[Restraint\] effect. Now I
can't move.  
  
\[Drain\] takes two seconds to cast, and I activated it first. Targeting
the spider that used the thread, I drained its health and recovered my
own. My HP recovered from the damage I just took. It seems the amount
increases as the skill level goes up.  
  
I cast \[Sand Spear\] on the spider afterwards. With the effects of
\[Dark Bind\] and \[Drain\], the spider's health was low, and it fell
with that single hit.  
  
Now, only one left. The enemy is already free from the effects of \[Dark
Bind\] and able to move.  
  
Earl was attacking the spider. He had been attacking for a while, so the
spider's health is low. …No, wait, Earl's HP is down to about half. It
shouldn't have been able to move until now. Now Earl's attacking again,
and oh, he missed! And he got hit with a thread ball!  
  
“\[Earth Shield\]!”  
  
I created a wall of earth to protect Earl, who's been \[Restrained\] by
the spider's thread. Good, I blocked the spider's attack. Now, I'll
finish it off with \[Wind Cutter\].  
  
"That was close."  
  
Early's HP is dangerously low, so I gave him a potion to recover.  
  
"Earl, you're not very good at combat, are you?"  
  
Earl nodded slightly. I understand after seeing the fight. Earl is an
orc, but it seems he's not good at fighting. Compared to the orcs I saw
in the Eastern Forest, his movements are worse.  
  
Earl slumped his shoulders.  
  
"Don't be so down. You did a great job of distracting the spiders at the
beginning."  
  
I told him that and he got back on his feet. You did a great job. Unlike
that white thing sleeping over there. Sure, you also worked hard, but
don't fall asleep just because the battle is over.  
  
After that, I gathered resources while fighting monsters that
occasionally appeared. My \[Earth Magic\] reached level 10, so I
acquired the new spell \[Quake\].  
  
And \[Shadow Magic\] reached level 5, and I acquired \[Dark
Compensation\]. It's a passive skill that's always active, and it seems
to increase my attack power while under a status abnormality.
Furthermore, the more status ailments there are, the more the damage
increases. …Come to think of it, there was that soup that gave me ten
status effects the other day.  
  
“…Niru, what's wrong?”  
  
I was having a great idea in my head when Niru began looking around
cautiously. When this happens, it's usually because he's sensed
something dangerous.  
  
The plants behind me rustled. I quickly dodged to the side, and sharp
red claws passed in front of my eyes, followed by a large, massive
body.  
  
"Grrrrruuuul"  
  
A beast's roar echoed through the quiet forest. It was a quadrupedal
beast-like creature covered in a reddish, viscous liquid. The dark red
liquid dripping from its body scorched the ground where it fell.  
  
“…What is that?”  
  
I've never seen this monster in this forest, nor heard of it. No, could
it be the one Miranda-san was talking about?  
  
Ah, I remember. I thought I'd never seen it before, but I'd seen it
once. That's right, it's the one that killed me in the White Forest. I
never thought I'd meet it here. I thought it only lived in the White
Forest…  
  
Niru can't identify it. I can't see its health. It's clearly a
higher-level monster than us.  
  
"Ah, I can settle the score from last time."  
  
Now, Earl, get ready. No matter what high-level monster I encounter, I
have no choice but to fight. It's a guaranteed death run, but I'll face
it.  
  
Besides, this time I'm not dead yet, so there's a chance. If I land a
few hits, I might win. I have the materials for that right here.  
  
"There it is! The red beast!"  
  
Just as I heard a person shout, a thunder magic spell flew out. It hit
the beast, and it ran away from us.  
  
"Damn it, again! Chase it, don't let it escape!"  
  
From the shadows of the bushes, a group of people in golden armor and
clothing emerged, shouting. They seem to be a party of eight. Several
people chased after the beast.  
  
"Huh? Who are you? You're not trying to steal our prey, are you?"  
  
The leader-like figure of the group spoke to me. Now, how should I
answer?  
  
"I didn't intend to steal it. I just have a personal reason for wanting
to defeat it."  
"I see, then I'm sorry but you'll have to give up. That thing is our
prey. Or rather, we were the ones who found it first."  
"…. I found it first."  
"Then show me some proof."  
  
…It's frustrating, but I don't have any such proof. There's no other
way. I'll back off. If I say any more, it might cause trouble.  
Attacking a monster that someone else is fighting is generally a no-no.
In this case, it would appear as if I'm the one doing the attacking.  
Besides, the chances that I could defeat that thing are slim to none.  
  
"Ah, may I ask one thing?"  
"What, are you complaining?"  
"No, do you know the true identity of that monster from earlier?"  
"No, I don't."  
"You were trying to defeat it without knowing what it was?"  
"I thought it might have rare drops since I'd never seen it before. And
you probably thought the same thing."  
  
Too bad, it's pure revenge for me.  
  
"Tsk, just don't get in the way."  
  
The golden leader and his companions disappeared into the depths of the
forest.  
  
Those people seemed to be ordinary players. By ordinary, I mean they
weren't role-players. Since I didn't interact much with ordinary
players, it was a bit refreshing.
