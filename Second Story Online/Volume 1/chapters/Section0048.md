# 48・Guardian of the Seal

The day after our after-party, I was walking through the \[Twilight
Forest\] toward a certain place.  
My reason for being here is because of Lucille-san. The other day she
told me to come see her again, but then she disappeared. I went back to
her house in Dairode Town, but it was empty. There was no sign of
Lucille-san or her black cat familiar.  
  
So, where is she? Only one place came to mind.  
  
The forest is as dim as ever. A boundary blended seamlessly with the
overgrown trees. A visible, cracked opening in an otherwise invisible
barrier—an entrance I created.  
  
"If she's anywhere, it's here."  
  
After confirming I was alone, I entered through the opening. Niru, who
would have normally stopped me, was quiet.  
  
Stepping through, I moved from the dark forest into a gray forest. A
white mist rolled in, obscuring even Earl's figure beside me.  
  
Suddenly, I felt something strange behind me and turned around. The
entrance I'd come through was slowly shrinking, as if repairing
itself.  
  
"...So I can't go back?"  
  
I'm not planning to run away. Or is there another reason?  
  
"Come on, Earl."  
  
I calmed the panicked Earl and took his hand.  
  
"Let's hold hands so we don't get separated."  
  
In this mist, getting separated would make it difficult to reunite.
Holding Earl's hand, we walked through the fog, swinging our joined
hands as if on a picnic.  
  
But I hadn't forgotten. If you're not careful, you'll get lost. My map
data is still completely black, showing nothing. I was considering
casting another detection spell when…  
  
"What's this?"  
  
The bracelet on my arm—the one Lucille-san gave me—was reacting to
something. It started moving as if being drawn in. I walked in that
direction.  
  
"This is…"  
  
The white mist suddenly cleared, opening up the forest. Before me was
the blue lake I'd seen before, its surface reflecting the sunlight.
However, the magic circle underwater was gone today. It just looks like
a normal, beautiful lake.  
  
"Meow"  
"Back cat…"  
  
Following the sound, I saw a black cat walking toward me along the
lakeshore. If it's here…  
  
"You've finally come. I was so tired of waiting I almost fell asleep."  
  
Behind the black cat stood an old witch in a black robe. Lucille-san
smiled happily with wrinkles in her eyes.  
  
"That because a certain nasty person didn't tell me where to meet."  
"Hee hee hee. I thought Chloe would be able to find my location. If you
couldn't, you're not worth meeting... and it seems I was right. My
modification to your bracelet wasn't in vain."  
  
Lucille-san laughed without malice. She intentionally didn't tell me the
location. And that bracelet modification was your doing, too?  
  
"Now that we've met again, I'm going to ask you everything I want to
know."  
"Very well. I'll tell you. But, as I said before, you don't need to know
what I'm about to tell you. You'll learn unnecessary things, and you'll
bear the responsibility of knowing them. Are you prepared to shoulder
that responsibility?"  
  
Lucille-san seemed to be saying I could turn back now. Her expression
was serious, as if she was wearing some kind of mask.  
  
"I'm not turning back after coming this far. Tell me everything,
Lucille-san."  
  
Chloe isn't one to be swayed by atmosphere. If she's curious, she'll
pursue it to the end. Seeing this, Lucille-san smiled again. It was a
smile that seemed somehow relieved.  
  
"So first of all Lucille-san, can you tell me exactly who you are?"  
"Just a humble magician."  
"Weren't going to tell me everything?"  
"Well, well, it's not entirely wrong. I'm an ordinary magician. I don't
have special powers like a hero. But I do have a special title."  
"Title?"  
"Guardian of the Seal. I'm the one who protects the seal in this forest.
Your familiar, who is from this forest, would know."  
  
I glanced at Niru. Indeed, he had tried to keep me away from the white
forest, and hadn't shown much hostility toward Lucille-san. As a former
inhabitant of the forest, Niru knowing about her wouldn't be strange.  
  
My familiar is perched on Earl's shoulder, and staring intently at
Lucille-san. It feels like a gaze of respect for someone special. But
there was something else mixed in, and he sometimes narrowed his eyes as
if trying to see through something.  
  
"So, is the seal you're guarding the magic circle in that lake?"  
"Yes, the lake itself is the sealing magic circle."  
"Then, what is that magic circle sealing?"  
"You've figured out this much already. Shouldn't you be able to
guess?"  
  
Lucille-san won't tell me. Well, it's true that with this much
information, I can guess. If I can't even guess that, she won't tell me
anything further.  
  
Let's see… what's sealed there? Lucille-san stopped the man in the red
hood from breaking the seal, even while she was being consumed by Chaos.
That means whatever is sealed here is so dangerous that it had to be
stopped at any cost.  
  
There's only one thing that dangerous in this world.  
  
"Chaos… right?"  
"Yes, that's right. The root and origin of all chaos in this world, the
great Chaos that was once sealed with the power of the star gods."  
  
I see. If what was sealed was that significant, it makes sense.  
  
"I'm surprised such a significant seal is located in a place like
this."  
"You should know. The forces of Chaos scattered throughout the world
have been sealed in various places. There are similar sealing magic
circles in many places in the world… but even I don't know how many
there are."  
  
The seals were mentioned in official history. But I never imagined one
would be next to a starting town like this.  
  
"If all the seals are broken, the world will fall into Chaos again. Even
a single broken seal shouldn't be underestimated. For example, if the
seal in this forest is broken, this entire region will be consumed by
Chaos, becoming a place where living things cannot survive."  
"So you sacrificed yourself to stop that man."  
"Exactly."  
  
I understand why Lucille-san desperately protected the seal. If the seal
had been broken, I might have been cursed by Chaos as well.  
  
"Then who was that man? From the way he spoke it seems like he knew what
was sealed away here..."  
  
"I hear there are those who are trying to break the seal of the great
Chaos. He was likely one of them. …They're a truly troublesome bunch. I
don't know how they found this place, but even though I knew of his
presence, he got away…"  
  
This sealed location should be kept secret. It shouldn't be known to
such people. But not only did he find this place, he also escaped.  
  
"He'll come again. Be sure to be fully prepared. I don't know when, but
until then, I…"  
"…Lucille-san?"  
  
Lucille-san quietly approached the lake. Bathed in the light of the
setting sun, the lake shimmered gold. It wasn't just the lake. The gray
trees around were also bathed in the golden light. The sight is truly
worthy of the name \[Twilight Forest\].  
  
"Beautiful, isn't it? It's only thanks to this magic circle that this
forest is able to shine like this."  
  
Lucille-san looked away from the lake and at me. Her smile is gentle,
but why do I feel uneasy…?
