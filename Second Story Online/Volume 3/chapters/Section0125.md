# 125・Irregularities Are Inevitable

Red Hoods, one wielding Rex, appeared in the Twilight Forest.  
They were sprinting towards the depths of the forest, towards my
location.  
  
"I knew you'd come here."  
  
After all, they’re the Crimson Apostles of Chaos.  
There's no way those who covet the power of Chaos would participate in
this war for Laptalica’s sake.  
I figured they'd use the war as an opportunity to target this place.  
  
"…! Watch out, behind!"  
  
One of them, who was using magic against a monster, noticed something
and shouted.  
And for good reason, it’s because Tsubaki-san suddenly appeared and
lunged at them with her ninja skills.  
It was an attack from a blind spot, and the target seemed unaware… but
the blade didn't connect, scattering a white nullification effect.  
  
"A defensive shield…!"  
  
But Tsubaki-san wasn't surprised by that. She immediately activated a
continuous high-speed slash skill.  
Several defensive skills exist, but they all share a set defense
value.  
If you inflict enough damage, they'll eventually break.  
And yet the scattered effect was pure white… This is strange.  
The earlier attack should have been an instant-kill. To withstand that
and still not have the shield broken by the successive slashes…  
  
"Why do you wield that sword… that sword can only be wielded by a hero…
guh!?"  
  
Tsubaki-san should have retreated to avoid the swinging greatsword.  
However, the greatsword shone, increasing the size of the blade.  
The greatsword, enlarged by the blade of light, caught Tsubaki-san who
had dodged, and mercilessly cut her down.  
  
"……?"  
  
The person wielding the greatsword froze slightly after the strike.  
The thing they'd cut down had somehow changed from Tsubaki-san to a
log.  
Truly, Tsubaki-san is amazing. To be able to use a substitution
technique even in this situation. There's no way I won’t capitalize on
that opening.  
I fired a fully-chanted Dark Burst into that gap, which lasted less than
a second.  
  
"Oops, dangerous!"  
  
But the opponent wasn't so easily dealt with.  
The incoming Dark Burst was blocked by a wall of light created by the
person without the sword.  
  
"Hey, Tsubaki. What are you doing in a place like this, you traitor?"  
"And what are you doing here, Ignis-dono?"  
  
The red robe was the same as the other members, the only difference
being that this one wasn't hiding their face under the hood.  
He’s rather short for a guy, with a baby face. His left eye is slightly
obscured by his red hair, and he’s wearing a childish smile.  
Ignis of the Crimson Apostles of Chaos was standing there.  
—And beside him, wielding the greatsword Rex, is a girl with white
hair.  
I recognize her. The girl's face has a hint of youth and white eyes that
reflect no emotion whatsoever.  
  
"Oh, this is… it's been a while, Mietia-san."  
  
For Chloe, it’s the girl she met on the night of the festival. For me,
it’s someone I could call a friend, now standing there with the Hero's
Sword in her hand.  
  
"That voice is Chloe-sama. Where are you?"  
"There's no way I'd tell you where I am. We're enemies now."  
  
I used my familiar, Niru, to broadcast my voice to the battlefield.
Before, we were allies and could talk via comms, but she's an enemy now.
The system prevents communication between enemy forces.  
  
"It's alright, you don't need to tell us. I know where you are, and
we’re going to you now… Mietia."  
"Yes."  
  
At Ignis's command, Mietia moved and attacked Tsubaki-san who was
standing in front of her.  
  
"Chloe-dono, is this person an acquaintance of yours!"  
"I only spoke to her briefly at the festival. Feel free to defeat
her."  
  
Perhaps because one of the Red Hoods was my acquaintance, Tsubaki-san
seemed hesitant to fight, so I answered that way.  
  
"Then, I would like to… but!"  
  
The greatsword was being swung around, making a heavy whooshing sound.
And at super high speeds.  
It was too fast for me to see properly; only afterimages were visible.  
  
Yet Tsubaki-san managed to narrowly dodge or parry with her blade.  
I can understand Tsubaki-san, but Mietia… where did you learn to swing a
sword like that? Your movements are extraordinary.  
  
"……Is that sword really the greatsword Rex?"  
  
Perhaps I'm seeing things wrong.  
To confirm, I asked Lucille-san.  
  
"Oh, there's no mistaking it. Furthermore, she's fully unleashed the
greatsword's power. One hit and you're down. What's going on? The
greatsword Rex is only supposed to be usable by the chosen one,
Light…"  
  
It's strange that Mietia, who isn't supposed to be a hero, can wield
it.  
Moreover, the opponent has a high-defense shield that hasn't been broken
yet. And if Lucille-san is right, even a single hit is dangerous.  
And…  
  
"Ugh…!?"  
  
Finally, Tsubaki-san was cut down by the greatsword. The blow was indeed
an instant-kill, and Tsubaki-san fell to the ground.  
I wanted to counterattack with magic, but their movements were too fast,
and I was too busy holding off Ignis.  
  
…Even though our player skills are pretty evenly matched, Tsubaki-san
was suddenly defeated without being able to do anything.  
I knew that since we were enemies, my friend and I would fight, of
course, but I never expected her to be such a monster!  
  
"Now then, it's about time you stopped being such a shut-in."  
  
The two of them approached the boundary of the barrier.  
I fired magic spells along the way, but they were blocked by Ignis and
then Mietia finished off Tsubaki-san with her sword.  
But… what to do? This place is protected by a stronger barrier than
before.  
  
"Mietia, please."  
"Understood."  
  
Mietia raised the greatsword and concentrated her power. Then she swung
it towards the barrier.  
There was a collision and a roar. The sound reached my ears near the
distant lake, and the aftershocks created ripples on the water's
surface.  
  
"Ah… my goodness. Another hole has been made."  
  
As Lucille-san said, a large crack has indeed appeared in the barrier,
just like when I made one before.  
…I see. Even a strong barrier can be destroyed by the power of a hero.  
  
"Chloe, what are you spacing out for!?"  
"I know! ... I'd like to do something about it."  
  
Honestly, Ignis alone is troublesome enough, but Mietia also seems like
a problem.  
What am I supposed to do alone? My only hope, Tsubaki-san, has already
been defeated.  
  
"—Wait!"  
"……Ignis-sama!!"  
  
More intruders came sprinting out of the woods.  
They ran straight towards Ignis.  
Mietia intervened, swinging her greatsword, but the other person parried
with a large shield and then used a \[Shield Bash\] to push Mietia
back.  
While no damage was taken, Mietia was knocked away.  
  
"……Kyle-san! You came!"  
"It looked like you were in a pinch. And it's not just me."  
"My sword… I finally found it…!! Give me back my sword!!!"  
  
Another person appeared from behind Kyle-san.  
A silver-haired boy, clad in brand-new Kingdom Army armor—Light-kun’s
voice, from the depths of his soul, echoed across the battlefield.
