# 118・An Old Friend

"Herbal Tea Shop - Twilight House… Now Open!"  
  
The handmade plaque on the door announced the opening. At the edge of
the plaque is an illustration of a pointed hat and a black cat, the
shop's trademark. It was made by Earl.  
  
Several days have passed since we opened the shop. Thanks to the
festival, advertising was perfect… but the only thing people talked
about was the cake. So, after talking with Earl, we decided to operate
not just as a pharmacy but also as a tea shop. Hence, the herbal tea
shop. Many of the cakes we sell are made with herbs.  
Opening the door and entering the shop. The interior, which used to be
Lucille-san's house, has been slightly renovated and contains several
tables and chairs. A distinctive feature is the skull ornaments used as
decorations. I'm glad I bought them.  
  
"Welcome… Oh, it's Kyle-san."  
"It’s been a while, Chloe."  
  
I was wondering who the first customer of the day would be… but
unexpectedly, it was Kyle-san. He has the same bright, refreshing smile
as always.  
  
"I'm here too!!"  
"Of course I didn't forget you, Light-kun."  
  
It's becoming a standard greeting with Light-kun. Sorry, you were hidden
in Kyle-san's shadow.  
  
"Well, you've become quite stylish and beautiful since I last saw
you."  
  
It’s great that Kyle-san is able to notice changes in women.  
  
"And you, Kyle-san, seem to have upgraded your equipment. Matching armor
with Light-kun, too."  
  
Kyle-san and Light-kun's armor is different from before. Matching armor
with silver plates and gold accents… This is, if I remember correctly,
the armor of the Kingdom's army.  
  
"You both became soldiers?"  
"Yeah, it was a bit of a special arrangement, though."  
"Special…?"  
"More importantly, Chloe… the lord of Dairode wants to meet you."  
  
…What? The lord of Dairode wants to see me?  
  
  
Leaving Earl in charge of the shop, I decided to head towards the lord's
mansion with Kyle-san and Light-kun.  
The new lord of Dairode. I caught a glimpse of her at the recent
festival, but I think it was a woman.  
Apparently, Kyle-san and Light-kun are now serving as her bodyguards.  
  
"We met her when we were trying to become soldiers in the capital."  
"...See, that greatsword, Rex, originally belonged to the lord here,
right?"  
"Ah, that's right, that's right."  
  
The greatsword Rex, which chose Light-kun as the hero. It originally
belonged to the lord, and it all started when those three thieves…
Azi-chan and the others… stole it.  
  
*'Lucille-san asked them to, right?'*  
*'Yes… I was in a hurry at the time and panicked back then.'*  
  
Lucille-san came along because she was worried about me being summoned
by the lord. Trying to justify her child-like form would be a pain, so
she's in her black cat form now.  
During the red beast incident, Lucille-san, who was searching for a
hero, had asked Azi-chan and the others to steal the sword, hadn't she?
Somehow, it ended up in Light-kun's hands, and then was stolen by
Tsubaki-san.  
Speaking of which, I wonder what happened to that sword? I wonder if
those guys in the red hoods still have it.  
  
"Because of that, we almost got arrested as sword thieves."  
"There was testimony that Light had the greatsword Rex…"  
  
Come to think of it, when we first met, Light-kun was openly walking
around town with the stolen sword without knowing it was stolen. It's
amazing he wasn't caught until now.  
  
"So if you almost got caught, that means you didn't get caught?"  
"That’s right. She listened to our story and acknowledged that I was
innocent and that I had the power of a hero."  
"Most importantly, the victim, the lord's daughter… now the current
lord, put an end to it."  
  
Because of that incident, they became favored by the lord and were hired
as her soldiers.  
The lord who helped them… I'm starting to wonder what kind of person she
is. When I saw her briefly in the square, my memory is of a beautiful
woman.  
  
We arrived at the lord's mansion. It's located near the center of town.
Passing through the gate and a spacious garden, a long, magnificent
building came into view. I'm quite used to Dairode Town now, and I've
known about the lord's mansion for a while, but this is my first time
entering it.  
  
The inside of the mansion is as magnificent as expected. Red carpets
were laid out, and chandeliers glittered from the ceiling.  
  
"Oh, Ange! You are absolutely stunning today too!"  
  
A high-spirited female voice echoed through the luxurious mansion.  
Huh…? Looking towards the source of the voice, I saw a woman on the
landing of the central staircase in the entrance hall. She was holding a
hand mirror, seemingly only looking at her reflection and not noticing
us.  
  
"My beloved angel…!"  
"Ange-sama. I have brought a guest with me."  
"Oi, I told you not to refer to My Esteemed Self by my angel name so
casually!" (TN: she uses ‘oresama’, which is like a very self-centered
way for a man to refer to himself)  
  
M-my esteemed self…? Did she just say "my esteemed self”…?  
Before my eyes, a beautiful woman was praising herself while holding a
hand mirror, before suddenly switching to a gruff, masculine tone to
scold Kyle-san.  
As I was dumbfounded, Kyle-san sighed deeply, and Light-kun muttered, "I
knew it would be like this."  
  
"Hmm… ah, it's good to see you! I've been waiting for you!"  
  
Noticing my presence, the beautiful woman put away her hand mirror and
the intimidating aura, and smiled at me. …There are many things I’m
wondering about, but for now, I'll read the mood without pointing
anything out.  
  
"Nice to meet you, my name is Chloe."  
"I am Ange, the lord of Dairode Town."  
  
We both lifted the hems of our dresses and curtsied elegantly, like
nobles. It’s hard to believe this is the same person as before; she
behaved exactly like a noble lady.  
  
"Well then... sorry for summoning you out of the blue."  
  
We moved to the drawing room and began talking. We sat on the sofas,
facing each other across the table. Kyle-san and Light-kun stood behind
her, looking like soldiers guarding her.  
  
"No. I was surprised that the lord knew about me."  
"I couldn't possibly not know about you, who's been the talk of the town
lately. I am the lord, after all."  
  
She added with a smile, "Although I only recently took office."  
  
"I wonder as to what kind of rumors are being spread."  
"That your attendant makes delicious cakes."  
"To reach the lord's ears, it's become quite famous. I’m sure my servant
will be pleased. I should have brought some as a gift."  
"We can talk about cake another time. …The reason I called you here is
because you are a skilled apothecary."  
"A skilled apothecary… Yes?"  
  
Ange-san smiled and reached for the prepared tea. After taking a sip to
moisten her throat, her red-painted lips opened.  
  
"Yes. …Lately, there have been many assault cases in Dairode and
surrounding towns by people using dangerous drugs, do you know?"  
"Of course. It's truly terrifying…"  
"Thanks to a new potion that's recently started circulating, the damage
is being contained."  
"Well, that's good. Now we can live in peace."  
"Yes. That's why I was wondering who made this medicine."  
"...So that's why I was called here. Because you think I'm the one who
made the potion."  
"You get straight to the point, which is helpful. So, are you the one
who made it?"  
  
Of course, I made it… but that's a little difficult to say. If I talk
about the recovery potion, which has the same ability as holy water,
I'll have to talk about the sealing magic circle and my true identity.  
Honestly, I don't think there's any need to hide my identity as the
guardian of the seal anymore. That information has already spread to the
point that it's practically impossible to keep it hidden.  
  
"Our investigation showed it's mainly sold at Miranda's shop. And you're
the apothecary she favors most among them."  
  
If the investigation has gone this far, there's no way to hide it…  
Last time, I managed to lie, but I might as well tell Ange-san. Kyle-san
and Light-kun are also here, and they’re trustworthy as well.  
  
Just as I was about to speak, Ange-san raised her palm as if to tell me
to wait.  
  
"If you have reasons you can't tell me, I won't force you. But I need
the medicine for this territory. As long as I can trade for it, that's
enough."  
"...Don't you find it suspicious?"  
"The effectiveness has been thoroughly reported. And Chloe, it seems
that you yourself are considered to be a trustworthy person."  
  
Ange-san glanced at Kyle-san and Light-kun. …I don't know what kind of
conversation they had to have to give her that evaluation, but it seems
she trusts me.  
  
"…Please tell me the delivery quantity, price, and deadline. Then I'll
consider whether to conduct business with you."  
"Thank you, Chloe. This will ensure the peace of the territory."  
  
The price Ange-san offered was high. And apparently, taxes are exempt.
There are many benefits to dealing with the lord directly.  
  
"I’d like to offer more… but Dairode isn't as wealthy as Iru or
Sealink."  
  
Still, it's plenty, so there's no need to worry. I was wondering what I
would do if she asked me to do it for free for the sake of helping the
people.  
  
"Thank you. It’s a blessing to have an apothecary like you in this
town."  
"I haven't even delivered anything yet."  
"I'm grateful for your existence."  
  
After we made the contract, Ange-san said that while shaking my hand.
…Well, there aren't many high-level alchemists in this early-stage town.
Most of them leave and rarely return.  
  
"Also, if you have any recovery potions or the like, I'd appreciate it
if you could deliver them as well. I'll take as much as you have, so
please bring as many as you can."  
"Okay, but… what are you going to use so many for?"  
"For emergencies."  
  
She smiled sweetly and refused to elaborate. Well, it's unlikely that
this lord would misuse them, so I think it's fine to deliver them. She’s
also making a deal without asking for details either.  
  
"It was an honor to meet you today. I didn't expect the lord to be such
a wonderful person."  
"My, thank you for the kind words."  
"Beautiful on the inside and out."  
"Yes, yes… that's only natural. After all, Ange is an angel!"  
  
…Hm? What did you just say?  
The way she crossed her arms and nodded vigorously was completely
different from the ladylike Ange-san she had been until a moment ago.  
  
"Oops, I slipped up. I'm not used to this role yet. Ange needs a break
for a while, I'm a bit tired."  
"Sigh…"  
  
…Yeah, well. I figured it out from the very beginning. Ange-san is a
role-player, and a male one at that.  
  
"…Ange-sama"  
"Hey, you called me by my angel name again. Gi—"  
"It's Kyle! Don't call me by my real name!"  
"Sorry, sorry. Umm, it’s Kyle-san, right?"  
  
…Could this be?  
  
"Are Kyle-san and Ange-san real-life friends?"  
  
Please forgive me for breaking my role-playing character. I'm just
curious.  
  
"Yes, yes. Ji… Carlo and I have been together for decades…"  
"Stop with the weird language. We're just work acquaintances. And it's
Kyle, not Carlo."  
"You're so cold, Lyle."  
"I told you it's Kyle… you're doing it on purpose."  
  
From this conversation, it seems they really know each other in real
life. Still, Kyle-san's work acquaintance… He said he works as an actor,
so Ange-san is probably also in the same field. That explains her
amazing acting. But…  
  
"She was such a refined lady… she's completely different now."  
"Right? As expected of an acquaintance of Kyle."  
  
Light-kun and I nodded in agreement. The greater the gap between their
acting and their true selves, the better their acting is.  
  
"…Seriously, why are you pretending to be a woman?"  
"That’s just how it is… if I can create the ideal beautiful woman, my
own angel, I'll do it! Ah, Ange! You're truly beautiful! My angel!"  
  
Again, Ange-san, holding the hand mirror, praised her avatar. …I can
somewhat understand that feeling… but it's a bit excessive, too open,
you know?  
  
"Kyle-san, you have some unusual acquaintances."  
"I never thought he'd be like this. I've known him for a long time, but
this is a first."  
"Don't call me an eccentric, there. You, Caril, look just like a
character I played in the past. Did you really like that character that
much?"  
"Da-aaaaah! Stop it! Don't talk about that!"  
  
Kyle-san, you’re so flustered you can’t even point out the mistake in
your name. It seems to be a topic he doesn't want to talk about.  
  
"Can I hear more about that?"  
"I'm curious about that old man Kyle's story too!"  
"Okay, okay! So, it's a story from the past. When I was a nameless
rookie, I played a certain protagonist. It was a classic lead character,
and he looked just like Carol."  
"It's Kyle."  
"By the way, this guy came to audition for the protagonist role and was
immediately rejected… but he got the villain role instead."  
"Don't reveal my personal information like that!"  
  
…So Kyle-san had such a past. Incidentally, Kyle-san was covering his
face with his hands in embarrassment.  
  
"You always said you wanted to play that kind of role… I’m glad you
found the chance to do it here. I like it."  
"...Think about what it feels like if someone you know finds out you
created and acted out a character who looks exactly like the character
your acquaintance really likes… I want to crawl into a hole!"  
"I'm happy! I found out that you really liked the character I played so
much."  
"That's why I didn't want you to know!!"  
"Then, you should have made it something you wouldn't mind being
associated with! Just like My Esteemed Self!"  
"I wish you'd share that confidence!"  
  
I can understand Kyle-san's embarrassment. But I'm more like Ange-san.
My real-life friend, Mietia, knows my character, after all.  
In Kyle-san's case… it’s a character played by an acquaintance, so the
shame must be doubled.  
  
"Damn it, Ange, I really didn't want you to know…"  
"So don't call me by my angel name outside of role-play."  
"You were angry even during the role-play!"  
"Was I? Well, I don't like being casually called by my angel name."  
"So then, what should I call you now? If I keep calling you this, you'll
get unreasonably angry again, you know?"  
"Then call me John, or Smith, or whatever… Cain."  
"You…!"  
  
Ange-san… you’re such a free spirit. Even Kyle-san is getting tired of
correcting her.  
  
"Let me introduce myself again. For now, just call me John,
Witch-chan!"  
"Um, nice to meet you, John-san."  
  
John-san, the person behind Ange-san, introduced himself in a
light-hearted manner and winked.  
It's complicated, but I think it’s better to completely separate this
person's character and personality.  
  
"By the way, you are prohibited from having a serious crush on Ange. I
won't let anyone have my wife."  
"I wouldn't do that, even if you didn't say anything."  
  
It's like that, you know. By the way, Ange-san's character name is
registered as 'My Beloved Ange'. The fact that it's not just 'Ange'
shows it's very typical of John-san.  
  
"That's right! If you have any problems, just rely on me, Chloe."  
"Eh, uh… okay."  
  
She instantly switched back to Ange-san's persona. …You can really tell
she's Kyle-san's acquaintance.
