# 104・Surprisingly Clumsy

The exploration proceeded smoothly after that. We discovered a staircase
leading from the first to the second floor and immediately went down.
The enemies were golems and creatures similar to stone rollers. There
were also bat-like monsters. However, we defeated them all without any
problems. Sometimes, I didn't even need to participate.  
  
On the second floor, the dropped items were a little better. We found
\[Enhanced Magic Stones\] and \[Damaged Cores\]. Apparently, the
enhanced magic stones can be used to enhance weapons, but they're only
for weapons of level 30 and above, so I can't use them with my current
weapon, but they'll be useful in the future.  
  
A \[Damaged Core\]. According to Lucille-san, collecting them might
allow me to create new cores. This means I could create proper golems,
not just an instanced one! I've only managed to get one so far. They're
quite rare drops.  
  
Then there were \[Repair Magic Stones\]. These allow you to repair
equipment without going to a blacksmith, which is very convenient. These
are also rare drops, though.  
  
The mapping speed was surprisingly fast. If you don't move forward, the
map won't show the terrain, etc. Normally, the map only shows a limited
area around you, but this time the range was much wider ...It seems that
Sazanka-san was the one who caused this effect.  
  
"I'm good at exploring these kinds of places."  
  
That's the answer I got when I asked her. She must have some kind of
surveying skill. …Still, what is Sazanka-san doing here? I've been
observing her through Niru, but she hasn't done anything suspicious.  
  
However, I noticed that she laughs occasionally. Of course, she wears a
hood, so her expression isn't visible, and her demeanor is cold. But she
laughs during random moments while fighting, or when talking to her
partner (Haku). ...Regardless of her character, I feel like the person
inside is enjoying the situation. Look, she just laughed again.  
  
"Wait. There's a hidden door there."  
"Really? Where, where?"  
  
As usual, it was Sazanka-san who found it. I looked in that direction,
but all I could see was a stone wall. However, when she pressed a
certain spot on the wall, it moved, revealing a new room.  
  
"Would you like to explore? There are some stairs nearby..."  
  
There's no way we could just ignore this and move on. It seems like
everyone else felt the same, so we all ended up exploring the room.  
  
"…Is this an armory?"  
  
All of the things placed in a disorganized fashion in the small room
were weapons of some kind.  
  
"They're all old and rusty. They're no longer of any use."  
  
Oliver-kun said that as he picked up one of the weapons and started
appraising it. But even so, why are there so many old weapons in a place
like this...?  
  
*'Lucille-san, do you know anything about this?'*  
*'Hmm. As I said before, this is a ruin from the Age of Calamity.
Judging by this, I think this was a fortress built when Chaos ran
rampant.'*  
  
There was a time when the world was engulfed in Chaos. The weapons here
seem to tell the tale of that terrifying era.  
  
"Hey, look! Isn't that a treasure chest!?"  
"There's another one here too."  
  
Apparently, there were treasure chests hidden among the pile of weapons.
Azi-chan and Sazanka-san pointed out two chests with excited
expressions.  
  
"Ah, both seem to be locked."  
"In that case, Saval, please! I'm terrible at lockpicking!"  
"Okay, okay. There don't seem to be any traps…Can I leave the other
chest to you?"  
"...Understood."  
  
Saval-kun and Sazanka-san took out their lockpicking tools and tried to
open the treasure chests.  
  
"Azi-chan isn't good at lockpicking, huh?"  
"Yeah, it's such delicate work. It's completely impossible for me. But
Saval is amazing at it! I always end up breaking the tools—"  
  
—Click  
—Snap!  
  
Two sounds echoed simultaneously. One sounded like something unlocking.
The other was the sound of something breaking.  
I looked at Savard-kun and he shook his head as if to say it wasn't him.
Then I looked next to him.  
  
"Sazanka-san…?"  
"My hand just slipped a little."  
  
Sazanka-san acted as if nothing had happened, holding the broken tool in
her hand. She tried again to open the lock, but...  
  
—Snap! The sound of breaking echoed again.  
  
"Hey, I'll open it, so you can take a rest."  
"...I'm ashamed."  
  
Sazanka-san slumped her shoulders slightly and walked away from the
treasure chest.  
  
"That’s surprising. I thought she'd be good at this kind of thing…"  
"I'm not very good at this kind of detailed work. To be honest, I'm also
bad at disarming traps."  
"What? Even I can disarm traps!"  
  
Azi-chan, who's clumsy with small things, has apparently been outdone in
clumsiness.  
  
"What have you done when you've found a trap before?"  
"If the trap was going to be triggered, I'd run through it at full speed
before it activated."  
  
Quite the brute force method. But somehow, I feel like she could pull it
off.  
  
"Okay, this one's open too."  
  
Saval-kun opened the chest in one go. Let's check the contents. There
were two chests, but each contained enough items for everyone. When we
opened both treasure chests, we found small spherical gems inside.  
  
"These are \[Magic Gems\],"  
"Magic Gems?"  
"A new item added in the last update. They’re magic stones that slightly
boost the stats of weapons, armor, and accessories. As an accessory
craftsman, I handle gems, and I also intend to become an artisan for
these as well."  
  
Oliver-kun said that with a grin. You can't use them unless your
equipment has slots for magic gems, so I can't use them with my current
gear. But let's remember this for the future.  
  
I’ll check the effects of the magic gem I got from the treasure chest.
Increased physical attack… increased agility… ugh, I don’t need it.
Agility is fine, but I don't need physical attack power. Are you telling
me to hit with my staff?  
  
"Increased magic attack…useless!"  
"No, no, that's an amazing drop!"  
"Well, I'm a swordsman. I do use magic, but not that much…"  
"Then, how about trading it for my increased physical attack?"  
"Really?! Yes!"  
  
So I traded with Light-kun. The others started trading, too. It seems no
one got what they wanted. I then traded Sazanka-san my agility increase
for a magic increase.  
  
After that, we left the armory and headed to the next floor.
