# 130・Pursuit of Ideals

"Oh..."  
  
Electronic fireworks burst in the blue sky, with confetti swirling.  
Beyond that stood a large white tower—the orbital elevator, a symbol of
this era.  
  
*‘Welcome to the Virtual Expo!’*  
  
A 3D holographic sign floated in the air above the venue.  
The Virtual Expo is an annual exhibition of VR, AR, and MR
technologies.  
Naturally, many VR game companies participate.  
It's a major event that draws attention from both companies and
gamers.  
Today, I was attending that event.  
I've never been before, but I heard that NR Corporation, the operating
company of SSO, was participating, so I decided to check it out.  
  
The venue is incredibly crowded, filled with information about various
technologies.  
However, most of these people aren't physically present.  
They're likely visiting from distant locations through their avatars.  
  
After all, this is an artificial island floating in the Pacific Ocean,
so it’s a little hard to get to geographically.  
Despite its location, this island is a hub for modern technology, and
many companies have their headquarters here.  
NR and Noah Corporation, for example.  
That's why the Expo naturally ended up being held here—because so many
VR-related companies are based here.  
Getting here is difficult geographically, but participating is easy.  
This island has excellent mixed reality infrastructure, allowing you to
project an avatar and explore the venue through it.  
Of course, you can even interact with the people physically present.  
The only thing you can't do is touch physical objects with your
avatar.  
Although avatars can interact with each other.  
  
When I say avatars, most people use realistic avatars that are
indistinguishable from their real selves.  
In fact, in a place like this that’s nearly indistinguishable from
reality, realistic avatars are probably mandatory for participation.  
  
"Hey! You're so short!"  
"And you're so tall..."  
"Well, I'm a dwarf in the game, so it's even more noticeable."  
  
I overheard two voices that sounded like high school boys nearby.  
It’s the entrance to the venue, so they must have been meeting up.  
There was a tall boy with brown hair and a short boy with black hair.  
They seemed to be meeting offline for the first time.  
  
"Sorry I'm late!"  
  
Then, running up to them was a girl about their age.  
Taller than the boys—maybe 170 cm?—blonde with blue eyes, and very
well-proportioned.  
She’s so beautiful she looks like a model.  
  
"Eh...are you real?"  
"Of course I'm real! I'm Kamilia!"  
"Hey, I heard another person was coming, but I didn't hear anything
about such a beautiful girl, Mitsunari."  
"I didn't know either!"  
  
It seems it was the kind of situation where you'd be surprised to meet
up offline.  
Maybe the girl's in-game avatar is male?  
  
"Come on, hurry up, over here! Sava... No, Yu-chan!"  
"Please don't rush. ...Actually, you almost got the name wrong again."  
"It's understandable. If you're going back and forth between here and
there, you're bound to get it mixed up."  
  
Another group of three, also looking like high school students, walked
past me.  
A lively girl was leading a young man with glasses and a large,
easygoing young man.  
  
Seeing the young people having fun brightened my mood.  
I would have liked to come with my friend as well, but she couldn’t make
it.  
I just happened to have some free time so I came by, so I wasn’t meeting
anyone.  
I decided to wander around the venue by myself.  
  
"Oops."  
"Oh, sorry..."  
  
As I was thinking that, I bumped into someone. …I never expected to bump
into someone here.  
I was about to apologize, but the words wouldn't come out.  
A large, muscular man. His hair, streaked with gray, was slicked back.  
He might be 190 cm tall.  
He’s also wearing dark sunglasses, and he looks very intimidating—scary
if you anger him.  
  
"Sorry, are you okay?"  
"It’s okay. I'm sorry too."  
"Sorry, I was a little lost and wasn't looking to where I was going. And
I didn't expect to bump into someone…"  
  
…But he seems like a nice person, despite his appearance.  
He was surprised and apologized too.  
It seems that he’s genuinely lost as he was looking around.  
Each time he turned his head, people seemed to move away slightly.  
  
"No navigation function?"  
"Bad luck, my terminal is acting up, and it's not working."  
  
He said this with a troubled smile, tapping his sunglasses.  
Location-based navigation is commonplace now.  
You can easily get to your destination with just one device, but it's
pointless if that device doesn't work.  
It’s said that modern people who rely on technological conveniences are
more likely to get lost without their devices.  
  
"Shall I guide you?"  
"That would be a huge help! I was worried I wouldn't make it in time."  
"Well then, let's hurry. Where are you going?"  
  
I asked him where he was going, checked the venue map, and guided him.  
  
"This way. I'll guide you, please follow me."  
"You're pretty good at this."  
"It's nothing. I'm used to guiding people because of work."  
  
Although, I've been retired for a long time now.  
We pushed through the crowded venue to his destination.  
It was a corporate booth, and a stage show seemed to have just started.
A large crowd had gathered in front of the stage.  
  
*'Hi everyone! Are you all doing well? I'm MM, your virtual idol!'*  
"Woohoo! MM-chan!"  
  
MM? MM… Could it be?  
Looking at the stage, there was indeed the virtual idol MM.  
The pink hair was the same, but she was wearing a cute outfit that was
less revealing.  
  
*'The \[Element Orb\] stage show! Today, we have special guests! Let's
welcome them! These two familiar faces from the movie!'*  
  
A man who looked like a nice middle-aged gentleman appeared, accompanied
by glittering music.  
He appeared dashingly in a navy blue suit. He’s a famous actor that even
I know about.  
But only one person showed up.  
  
"Uh oh?"  
  
MM-chan looked towards the wings of the stage looking troubled.  
According to MM-chan, another person should be showing up, but no one
else did.  
  
"—Don't hide! Come out, Emperor! Are you afraid of being defeated by
me?"  
"Nonsense, I'll crush you right now."  
  
The man on stage suddenly said this, and in response, a terrifying low
voice echoed.  
I’ve seen this exchange before.  
It’s a line spoken by the protagonist in the movie \[Element Orb\] when
he confronts the emperor, the final boss.  
I was surprised… Because the source of that low voice was right next to
me.  
  
"Thanks for guiding me."  
"Ah, you're..."  
  
The large man took off his sunglasses and headed toward the stage amidst
a roar of cheers.  
  
"You're late, Gino."  
"I had a bit of an accident. Sorry for the delay."  
  
The stage show continued in a cheerful atmosphere.  
Still, I’m surprised that the person I gave directions to was a
celebrity.  
I wanted to watch the stage show, but the crowd became too dense.  
It seems difficult to watch it right now. I’ll check out the archived
livestream later.  
  
Thinking that, I decided to wander around the venue again.  
  
"Hey, hey! I heard that the Illusionist is putting on a magic show over
there!"  
"Eh, seriously!"  
  
As I walked along with the flow of people, I heard such a
conversation.  
A magic show... I haven't seen much magic, so maybe I'll check it out.  
  
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my magic show. Let me present you with
moments of miracle woven between the virtual and the real."  
  
Dressed in formal attire, a platinum-blonde young man stood in the
middle of the crowd.  
He was tall and slender, with a sweet face. When he winked, the women
squealed.  
Next to him is a beautiful woman, presumably his assistant.  
Beautiful men and women standing side by side is so dazzling.  
  
"They look very similar. Are they siblings?"  
"That’s right, they're siblings. The magician is the younger brother,
and the assistant is the older sister."  
  
A petite woman with freckles next to me answered my mutterings.  
A beautiful magician sibling pair... Ah, now that I think of it, they
were a hot topic on TV before.  
A rare magician who incorporates modern technology while maintaining the
essence of traditional magic. Their moniker is the Illusionary Magician,
isn’t it?  
There’s no stage or audience seating. It was a complete guerilla event,
performing magic on the spot.  
The magic incorporated AR and VR technologies and was truly
impressive.  
The performance was nearing its end. Finally, the young magician was
locked in a box and had to escape, a classic story.  
His body was verified as real, not an avatar, and he was locked inside
the box.  
Then, swords were ruthlessly thrust into it.  
The swords were also confirmed to be real, so if he had stayed in the
box, he would have been impaled.  
  
"Wow!"  
  
The box opened, but the magician wasn't there.  
He successfully escaped, and cheers arose from the audience.  
  
"—1, 2, 3!"  
  
With a \*pop\*, flowers scattered in the air.  
  
"Would you like one too?"  
  
A single flower was presented to me....It was the magician who had been
in the box until just a moment ago.  
As I received the offered flower, the sound of a camera shutter rang
out.  
  
"You again. What kind of gossip article are you planning to write this
time?"  
"Don't be silly, sir. I don't always write gossip articles. And I'm just
here as a helper today. But if something newsworthy happens to come
along, that's another story."  
  
The freckled woman seemed to be a reporter. She showed off her press
armband.  
The magic show ended with great success.  
They apparently perform these shows throughout the Expo period.  
  
Next, I went to the NR Corporation booth. An event featuring NR
Corporation's CEO was about to begin.  
  
"I, I can't see anything..."  
  
As expected, many people had gathered for this high-profile event.  
Even though it was being live-streamed, many wanted to experience the
atmosphere of the event in person, fighting for good spots.  
  
"There are good seats over here, come on."  
"Eh...?"  
  
My hand was pulled through the crowd and I was taken away in an
instant.  
  
"Hey!"  
  
Please don’t forcibly drag me away.  
When I finally got through the crowd, I realized who had pulled me and
immediately understood.  
  
"Here's my ID. Ah, this girl is with me, so it's alright, right?"  
"If you're with the doctor, it's alright. Please go ahead."  
  
She showed her ID and passed through to an area accessible only to
staff.  
I was in the staff viewing area—the VIP section.  
  
"...I didn't expect to see you here."  
  
A woman with her gray hair pulled back, wearing a familiar white coat.
My old friend.  
She’s the one who gave me the Arc Connect VR device as a birthday
present.  
  
"I'm surprised too. That you would come to an event like this. I thought
you would be staying home and playing games or something."  
"I do go outside sometimes. Well, I won’t deny that it’s game-related,
but... It's good to see you."  
"That's right, today's event is related to the SSO you play. ...Long
time no see, you haven't changed a bit."  
  
It had been several years, but she’s still just as energetic, which was
nice.  
Her appearance might have aged a bit.  
  
"Is SSO fun?"  
"Yes, it is."  
"That's good to hear. If you feel that way, then it’s definitely a
success. I think I made the right decision leaving those kids with
you."  
  
She looked at the stage and the crowd. We were a little higher up, so we
could overlook the entire venue.  
  
"Seriously... I wonder what's so pitiful about it. If they're human,
treat them like humans."  
  
There were tens of thousands of people in the venue. Among them, there
were some who were not truly human.  
But they are people. They’re protected by law and have human rights.  
  
"People have such short lifespans and irreplaceable bodies… yet to force
that upon ‘new friends’…"  
"...If they’re human, that's only natural."  
  
People use language and have emotions.  
Different people have different special skills, and the differences are
often significant.  
Even those with good memories may forget things.  
And sometimes they make mistakes.  
They have a limited lifespan, and they’re fragile enough to die in an
instant.  
That’s what it means to be human. And the new humans must abide by
that.  
Because they are also human.  
Although they don’t have the same intentions, emotions, make mistakes or
age. They don't have a lifespan and their bodies can be repaired quickly
if they break down.  
  
"It’s ridiculous. In the end, you're just measuring them with human
standards and values."  
"But it would have been difficult to accept otherwise. It's difficult to
understand something that deviates too much from the norm."  
"I guess so. ...But considering the uncanny valley phenomenon, I think
they'll eventually adapt..."  
  
Things that are too similar, too perfect, sometimes become a source of
intense discomfort and fear.  
The former 'friends' were like that. They were so similar that they were
feared.  
Still, some people tried to accept it by fitting them into their own
common sense.  
That's why they asked them, are you human, or are you a machine?  
  
"...Neither human nor machine. A completely new existence would be more
like an alien. It will probably take a long time to accept something
that's suddenly appeared."  
  
Challenging the usual conventional wisdom and common sense is
difficult.  
If you explain today's common sense to people from hundreds of years
ago, they won’t understand.  
  
"Well, I can guarantee that their futures will be bright! ...But, I,
too, think their current state of being is strange, and I'm someone who
wants to change it because of my own ego!"  
  
She laughed, saying that she’s also that kind of person.  
After all, the "friends" had never once protested their treatment.  
  
"By the way, it's been a while since you retired, right?"  
"Yes, but... what about it?"  
  
  
She suddenly changed the subject of our conversation.  
  
“Are you interested in working as a receptionist at my company?”  
“Your company has been using robots for that since ten years ago, hasn't
it? I'm a human, so that's impossible.”  
“…The new employee from three years ago has been unpopular because they
lack charm and friendliness.”  
"Well, that's just how it is, being a robot."  
  
It’s a common story, really. Implementing machines made things
convenient, but it took away the personal touch.  
  
“…If it’s absolutely necessary, I'll consider it.”  
“That's good. I'll bring it up at the next meeting.”  
  
As we were having this conversation, a great round of applause and
cheers erupted.  
It seems the stage presentation had begun. Taking the stage was the CEO
of NR Corporation.  
A middle-aged man, sharply dressed in a suit.  
  
“Now then, everyone, are you enjoying our company’s new game, SSO?
Another story in a fantasy world far removed from reality. I’m sure you
all share a longing for such a world. I certainly have, and that desire
to go to such a world is what drove me to create countless games. But
there’s another desire I’ve harbored…—What if this real world itself
became such a world? Hasn’t anyone ever thought that?”  
  
His fingers snapped. At the signal, green trees began to grow in the
venue, and petals scattered in the wind.  
It's all made of holograms, of course.  
  
“…Is he planning to do an AR-like game?"  
“It’s not something so simple. He’s trying to bring a virtual world into
reality (this world).”  
“It’s a large-scale project, to say the least. Even if it’s realized, it
will probably take years.”  
"But it sounds fun, doesn't it?"  
  
Blue butterflies fluttered around, and one came in front of us. The
butterfly landed on the flower I had just received earlier.  
The butterfly landing on the real flower is a hologram. I can’t touch
it.  
But if this holographic existence were to gain mass and become real, it
could no longer be called fake.  
…I don’t disagree with her words.  
If something like the world of SSO were possible in reality, I think it
might be fun.  
  
“He has an ideal of one day changing this world. …As someone with
similar ideals, I want to support him.”  
  
Her eyes shone brightly as she said that.  
  
*‘Now then, let me introduce a vital collaborator for our next project.
The CEO of Noah Industry, and the developer of the support robot—’*  
“Oh, that’s right, it’s my turn.”  
“…If you were part of the presentation, why are you here?”  
“It can’t be helped, I found you.”  
  
Called from the stage, she rushed off in a fluster.  
Fortunately, we weren't far from the stage, so she could easily get
there.  
  
"Well, I'm off now, Chloe."  
“Yes, please go.”  
  
I watched her back as she ran towards the stage.  
  
“…Chloe?”  
  
When I turned around at the sound of my name, there was a large man
wearing sunglasses…that actor.  
  
“Ah, sorry. Well, it’s just that someone I know has the same name.”  
“No, it's fine. But my name isn't Chloe.”  
“Eh? But just now…”  
“My last name is Kuroeda. Chloe is just a nickname.” (TN: Kuroe →
Chloe)  
  
That said, in reality, only that person calls me by that nickname.  
  
“Say, I’ve been thinking… haven’t we met somewhere before?”  
“That’s a pretty cliché pickup line.”  
"I'm not trying to flirt..."  
“Well, to be honest, we haven’t met.”  
  
I’d seen his face one-sidedly in films before, but this was the first
time I actually met this actor face-to-face.  
  
"I, I see..."  
  
He looked a little surprised, but he didn’t seem too disappointed and
recovered quickly.  
  
"By the way, can I ask you a favor?"  
“What is it?”  
“—Could you give me an autograph?”  
  
I held out some electronic autograph paper and asked with a cheerful.  
  
  
◆ ◆ ◆ ◆  
  
  
“The war seems like it was pretty tough, huh~”  
“Yes, it was very difficult.”  
Today, when I logged into SSO, Miranda-san happened to be at the shop.  
Since she wasn’t logged in during the war, she asked me about what
happened, so we ended up talking while having tea.  
  
“The victory in the war was thanks to the bravery of my lord!”  
“Umm, Chloe-chan, who is this person? She looks like a new employee.”  
“Something like that.”  
  
Come to think of it, Miranda-san hasn’t had any contact with her.  
  
“That’s an understatement! I am a loyal and dependable ninja who serves
my lord!”  
“Don’t call yourself dependable.”  
  
As for why Tsubaki-san is working here.... While she said that it's only
natural for her to work at her lord’s store, she forcefully entered… no,
she spontaneously started helping out.  
Well, I won’t deny she’s capable, and having her work for free isn’t a
problem, so I’ve just let it be.  
  
“Then, what about that white-haired girl over there?”  
“I found her.”  
  
I answered as she pointed to Mietia, who was sitting at the counter with
Niru eating Earl's homemade cake.  
  
“Niru, this is delicious.”  
  
At Mietia’s praise, Niru nodded repeatedly. Then, as if to indicate she
should eat a different cake next, he pecked at the plate with his
beak.  
…It looks like he’s feeding a chick.  
But I never thought that Niru would share his food.  
It looks like he’s teaching a girl who doesn’t know delicious food the
joy of eating.  
  
As for why Mietia is here, after the war, I found her lost in the
Twilight Forest.  
Apparently, she got separated from Oswald during her escape.
Incidentally, Oswald seems to have been captured and imprisoned.  
If I had left her alone, she would have been thrown in jail as an
accomplice, so I took her in. …Well, I guess it was also for personal
reasons, since she's my real-life friend.  
  
“Anyway, being able to enjoy tea like this is thanks to Chloe-chan and
the others. Thank you for protecting the town.”  
“No… Please tell Rush-san and the others that next time you see them.
They worked hard too.”  
“I know~”  
  
We successfully defended the town and protected the seal.  
And we got a few more friends.  
And most importantly…  
  
“…Fufufu.”  
  
Since then, I’ve been looking at the title list again and again.  
A certain title changed after the war.  
  
“What’s wrong, Chloe-chan?”  
“No… Oh?”  
  
As I was about to reply to Miranda-san, I received a notification
indicating that an intruder had entered the depths of the forest.  
  
“Excuse me, I just remembered something I have to do. …I’ll leave the
shop to you, Earl, Tsubaki-san.”  
“Got it~! See you later~”  
“Understood! I will protect this store with my life!”  
  
With the two of them and Earl seeing me off, I headed towards the
forest.  
  
—In the Twilight Forest lives a guardian.  
She was once known as the Grass Witch.  
But a certain video on History gave her another name.  
  
“Hey, that’s…”  
“I knew it! That’s the \[Black Witch!\]”  
  
Two people who seemed to be players said that.  
So, as usual, I called out to them.  
  
“Hello. What are you doing so deep in this forest? If you’re lost, I’ll
guide you.”  
  
I'm the \[Black Witch\] who resides in this land—Chloe.  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**Afterword**  
  
This is the end of Risomajo!  
I was hesitant about revealing the real name and other things in the
final chapter, but I decided to include them because it's a VRMMO
grounded in reality.  
There are also several unresolved plot points (like Chloe's family,
etc.), and I could have continued, but it felt like a good stopping
point, so I decided to end it here.  
I'd like to address the unresolved plot points someday, perhaps in a
side story or something... if I feel like it.  
  
I've also started posting a new work. It's a non-human reincarnation
story.  
[I'm not an evil dragon! I was reincarnated as the second water dragon,
but the previous one was called the evil
dragon.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ncode.syosetu.com/n4744gq/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1743254263416166&usg=AOvVaw36LtWRVmCjg7LdqVy3JTwh)  
  
As the title suggests, it's the story of a girl who has to clean up the
mess left behind by her incredibly troublesome predecessor. It's
basically planned to be a heartwarming happy ending. I plan to update
daily for a while.  
I'll be writing up to a good stopping point before changing to a
different posting style, so updates might become slower.  
  
That's all for now. The end.  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
TN: 
Glad I found this. Also, the WN linked in the author's afterword is already tagged as completed at 109 chapters (last one on April 1st, 2025).  
  
Thank you for reading :)  
  
My next (current) project is "[Heartwarming Different World
Reincarnation Days With Level Countertop, Item Carryover! I’m the
Strongest Little
Girl](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/heartwarming-different-world-reincarnation-days-with-level-countertop-item-carryover-im-the-strongest-little-girl/)."
Messy title aside, it's a fairly silly light-hearted adventure. It has
some typical WN rough edges, but I've read the whole story already and
enjoyed it. Check it out if it looks interesting.
