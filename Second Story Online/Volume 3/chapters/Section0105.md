# 105・Not Yet Expired

Our dungeon exploration went smoothly, and we finally reached the fifth
floor. However, the enemies grew stronger with each floor we
descended.  
  
"Be careful. Those iron golems seem to have very high physical
resistance!"  
"No wonder my attacks aren’t getting through."  
  
Kyle-san parried the golem's attack with his shield while replying to
Bluey-kun. Bluey-kun apparently has an analysis skill, and if the
analysis is successful, he can obtain detailed information about the
monster.  
The monster, the \[Iron Golem\], has extremely high physical resistance.
However, if one ability is exceptionally high, others tend to be
lower.  
  
"Chloe!"  
"Yes, I'm ready anytime!"  
  
From behind, I prepared my staff while a magic circle appeared at my
feet. The circle was emitting a strong purple light, showing that it’s
ready.  
With that as the signal, the vanguard retreated while keeping the four
iron golems together as close as possible.  
  
After confirming everyone was safely distanced, I cast the spell I had
been chanting. \[Dark Burst\] was activated, centered on the four
golems, and the dark explosion wiped out their HP. They have high
physical resistance, but conversely, these golems have very low magic
resistance.  
  
"Alright, that's the end of—""  
"No, wait. There's still one left!"  
  
Saval-kun, ever vigilant, nocked an arrow and fired. The arrow,
whistling through the air, pierced the core of the single remaining
\[Iron Golem\] that had remained unscathed.  
  
"Why...?"  
"According to the analysis, that one has high magic resistance."  
  
Bluey-kun was apologetic. It seems the other three had high physical
resistance, but this one was different.  
  
"If physical attacks work, there’s no problem!"  
  
Light-kun charged towards the golem running towards us, swinging his
greatsword and defeating it.  
  
That’s the end of the battle for now. The appearance of these monsters
with resistances is making things harder, but the drops have improved. I
even got a \[Golem Core\]. Not a damaged core, but a proper one. I’m
very happy.  
  
《Your level has increased to 30.》  
  
My level also went up. The experience here is excellent, so I reached
level 30 quickly. Hmm... my skill levels are almost ready to go up
too.  
  
"Hmm... there's another hidden room over there."  
  
Sazanka-san, who was ahead of us, stopped and pointed to a spot on the
stone wall. Looking closely, we could see something that looked like a
door. It was hidden... or rather, it was hard to see. Entering the room,
there's a table, and in the back, a kitchen area with a hearth. Was this
the facility's dining hall?  
  
"It's a good opportunity, let's take a break here?"  
  
It’s Kyle-san who suggested this. Everyone agreed so we took a short
break.  
  
"Please get some rest too, Niru."  
  
Niru yawned tiredly and went to sleep. Since we're in a dungeon, telling
the time is difficult, but it's daytime. For Niru, a nocturnal creature,
moving at this time is quite strenuous.  
  
Looking around, everyone started taking their break. Kyle-san is sitting
on a chair, arms crossed, eyes closed... he seems to have stepped away.
Light-kun is with Azi-chan and her two friends, talking about the
monsters and drops.  
  
Sazanka-san is with Haku in a separate area. Judging from the way her
eyes are moving around busily, she’s probably sorting through the
dropped items on the screen that was in her field of vision. ...She
keeps glancing over at the four of us though.  
  
Then I noticed Oliver-kun in the back, near the kitchen area.  
  
"What are you doing?"  
"I'm checking if this kitchen is still usable...the hearth works. If I
can start a fire, we can cook here. Finding this in a dungeon like this
is lucky."  
  
...Come to think of it, without a skill to cook outdoors, you can't cook
without a dedicated facility.  
  
"We've been fighting non-stop. You must be quite hungry, right?"  
  
Saying that, Oliver-kun took out some firewood and flint. He's right; my
hunger level has dropped considerably. When you’re hungry, it affects
your status, so you have to eat something to fill your stomach.  
  
Oliver-kun, being a non-combatant, isn't that hungry, but he wants to
help by cooking. If he hadn't found this place, he said he would have
made a makeshift cooking area. That's good preparation.  
  
"I'm looking forward to it."  
"My cooking isn't that good, so don't expect much."  
  
The taste of the food depends somewhat on player skill. If you're at a
high level, you can make a normal dish no matter how badly you cook
it.  
  
Come to think of it, I seem to have forgotten something... Ah.  
  
"I forgot about the dark soup's expiration date!"  
  
I hastily opened my item box. I made a lot of dark soup the other day.
Their expiration date is in a few hours. Ugh... I should have checked
the soup stock properly. Some of the soup has already expired. Ah, what
a waste.  
  
The expiration date system was added in the last update. No matter how
long I carried food before, it never spoiled... the developers have
really added some unnecessary elements.  
  
"Whoa, what's that? Is it rotten?"  
"It's not rotten yet. That's how it is from the start."  
"No way... you're lying..."  
  
Oliver-kun recoiled from me holding the dark soup. When it rots, the
item name changes to \[Expired Food\]. The appearance also changes.  
  
If you eat it, you get the \[Stomach Ache\] status ailment. Even if it
is dark soup that gives multiple status ailments. Incidentally, the
taste also changes to something that’s still edible. I wonder why the
performance decreases when it spoils.  
  
"Isn't that the one Chloe drank the other day?"  
"Oh, I thought it looked familiar. It's that crazy soup from that
time!"  
  
Light-kun and Saval-kun looked on with interest, perhaps having seen me
drink it before using magic.  
  
"If I remember correctly, you got super strong after drinking that."  
"Yes, it's certainly the source of my power."  
  
It inflicts numerous status ailments, making it easier to get the
effects of \[Dark Compensation\].  
  
"Let me have some!"  
  
Saying that, Light-kun grabbed the dark soup from my hand and drank it
all in one go. Oh, no.  
  
"...Ugh!! What is this, it's soooo disgusting!!"  
"Are you okay!?"  
"I'm glad I was prepared..."  
  
He dropped the bowl immediately after taking a sip and collapsed,
clutching his mouth. Seeing his condition, Azi-chan quickly handed him
some water, and Bluey-kun healed his status ailments.  
  
"You were drinking that with such a straight face..."  
  
Saval-kun looked at me with a cold look in his eyes.  
  
"I've gotten used to the taste. Would you like to try it?"  
"After seeing that, no way!"  
  
It's fine, it's perfectly fine for humans to eat. In fact, you should
think of it as an experience. It’s probably the first time you'll ever
taste something like this.  
  
"...What happened while I was gone?"  
  
Ah, Kyle-san is back. He looked up from his downcast state and gazed
curiously at the suffering Light-kun.  
  
"I drank Chloe's soup and ended up like this. It's crazy that it's not
rotted, it tasted awful."  
"Really? But isn't that a bit of an exaggeration to go that far over a
soup? And it's rude to say something like that."  
"If you think so, drink some yourself."  
  
Light-kun looked in my direction. Ah, so you want me to serve some soup.
I have plenty in stock, so I'll give him some. It's all close to its
expiration date, but that's okay. As long as it's before the expiration
date, all the dishes are served freshly made, according to the game's
specifications.  
  
"This is..."  
  
Kyle-san froze when he saw the soup in front of him. Yes, it looks bad.
It's the devil's soup that makes you think you'll die if you drink it.
You will actually die.  
  
"Hey, what’s the matter, Kyle-niichan! If you're going to drink it,
hurry up, it's rude to Chloe!"  
  
Light-kun seems to be having a lot of fun teasing this guy. Kyle-san
probably won't refuse to drink the soup. After all, the character of
"Kyle" is not the type of person who would do something like that.  
  
But the player is different. It seems like he doesn't want to drink it.
For a moment, it felt like Kyle-san's eyes were glaring at Light-kun. If
you want to blame someone, blame your character for not being able to
say no.  
  
"...It might just be the appearance, I can't judge without trying it."  
  
He seems to have made up his mind, his face serious. Truly, Kyle-san is
a model role-player. In that case, let me show my respect for his
determination.  
  
"I'm so glad you want to eat my cooking so much. Let me feed you
then."  
"Eh...?"  
  
I scooped some soup with a spoon and offered it to Kyle-san. Kyle-san
looked flustered, which is amusing. Are you really that happy to be fed
by Chloe? ...Or are you having trouble because you can't use your hands
to pretend to eat?  
  
"Having come this far, you won't say no, right?"  
"……Of course not."  
  
My smile must be as dark as the dark soup right now. Kyle-san gave me a
slightly dry smile and came over to me. He grabbed my hand holding the
spoon and pulled it towards him.  
  
*‘…Leaving me aside, don’t you feel sorry for Kyle?’*  
*‘It all started with Light-kun, Kyle-san.’*  
*‘That’s true, but you were happily participating.’*  
*‘I won’t deny it.’*  
  
He said this in a voice only I can hear, glaring at me. As always, his
glare was menacing in a way that didn't suit him.  
  
*‘You damn witch!’*  
  
Despite his cursing, Kyle-san drank the soup.  
  
"...Th-this is...cannot be called just soup...!"  
"See, I told you."  
"Whoa, Kyle-san also collapsed!?"  
  
As expected, he fell to the ground, writhing while clutching his mouth,
just like Light-kun. Thank you, Kyle-san. I won't forget you. Well, I'd
be in trouble if you really died, though.  
  
"...I'm starting to wonder how bad it tastes."  
"Don't, Bluey. I can't heal you if you drink it."  
"But I'm curious too!"  
"Are you seriously going to drink it, Azi!?"  
"I'll drink that soup myself! Saval, you too!"  
"No, I'm not having any! I told you I'm not drinking it!"  
  
…Needless to say, Bluey-kun's healing magic was used twice after that.  
  
"But no one finished the soup… I think it'll be okay once you get used
to it."  
*‘…Chloe, I wouldn't say this if it weren't important, but you shouldn't
let anyone else eat that soup.’*  
  
Lucille-san scolded me in a weary voice. Even an NPC is stopping me.  
  
"Hey, hey, what's going on? How about you wash it down with my
cooking?"  
"A god has appeared!"  
"Yes, yes! Thank you, Oliver!"  
  
The dish Oliver-kun made was a simple vegetable consommé soup.  
  
But after eating the dark soup, everyone ate this soup as if it was the
most delicious food in the world, looking very happy.  
Well, yes, it's true that after that soup, it's refreshing and feels
like it’s cleansing your mouth.  
  
"Oh, one of my stocks is missing?"  
  
That's strange. Even accounting for the amount of dark soup I served
everyone, one is missing. Just as I tilted my head, I heard a scream and
the sound of something falling.  
  
"...Sa-Sazanka-san collapsed!"  
"I didn't think it was you!"  
  
Another person succumbed to curiosity. The terrible power of the dark
soup.
