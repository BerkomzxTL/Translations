# 101・Get Rich Quick

I'm back in the game, using my new VR equipment.  
It feels like the accuracy of my senses has improved a little... maybe
the difference will be more noticeable in crowded areas.  
  
Since I have some free time, I'll go check on the herb garden.  
Earl is taking care of it… or rather, I've pretty much left it entirely
to him.  
  
I need to give Earl a bigger paycheck. At first, Earl didn't seem to
know how to spend his money, but now he’s buying things constantly. The
amount of possessions he has has grown noticeably. He was at
Miranda-san's shop the other day too.  
  
I harvested the herbs with Earl and planted the next ones. I also
received a new potion order from Miranda-san. After that, I went home.  
  
Taking a break, I decided to take a closer look at the latest update.  
  
This update was a major one, and players have been buzzing about it. I
was particularly interested in the improvements and additions to the
wake word function.  
Voice-activated system controls have been slightly changed from the
previous version. A weapon summoning system has been added, allowing for
easier equipping and unequipping of weapons.  
  
"《Call Weapon》"  
  
Saying the wake word, my equipped staff appeared in my hand. Ah, this is
truly worthy of being called weapon summoning. The staff materialized in
my empty hand out of nowhere.  
  
"《Call Release》"  
  
Saying the release word, it disappeared with a flash of light. The
weapon itself wasn’t unequipped, but temporarily stored in the item
box.  
  
This is incredibly convenient. Summoning weapons is a romantic thing,
but having to carry a staff all the time can be a hassle...  
  
Also it seems you can change the registered words…  
  
"《My staff, to my hand!》"  
  
You can also cast a spell to summon a staff! The wake word activation
method for skills has also been updated.  
  
Oh, so the activation words for skills can be changed... meaning you can
implement a spellcasting system.  
  
You can still use the visual selection from the skill slot, but I want
to use this method. Because if you're using magic, you want to cast a
spell, don't you?  
I'll adjust the skill activation words. They shouldn't be too long, or
it'll be a disadvantage.  
  
And then there’s… skill customization. This is a new feature that allows
you to change just the appearance of a skill. By appearance, I mean the
effect or shape.  
  
For example, I use the \[Dark Magic\] skill \[Shadow Arrow\]. When
activated, it launches a purple dark arrow from the tip of my staff.
Apparently, I can change the color from purple to red, or change the
shape of the arrow to a thorn.  
  
Since you can change the skill activation incantation, the same spell
can look completely different.  
  
For example, I can name it Thorn of Thorns and have it shoot red thorns.
But the performance will be the same as \[Shadow Arrow\].  
  
The price is 50 star coins per skill… If you want to customize all your
skills, it’ll cost a lot of money.  
For now, there's no need to change them… in fact they’re fine as they
are so let's leave it be.  
  
After confirming the updates and taking a break, it's time for work. I
recently bought a house, so I'm broke.  
  
I need to earn money to pay Earl’s salary, and to buy new weapons and
armor. So I thought I'd try something new.  
  
It’s making dyes.  
  
They're used to change the color of clothes. Apparently, you can make
them with the alchemy skill. I found a book about it that I could read
on my bookshelf.  
  
I learned about it from reading, but the idea came to me when I was
watching the El Dorado clan. They wear matching gold outfits, and they
use dye to change the color of their gear.  
  
I have 50 freshly harvested Lady Black herbs. It takes a considerable
amount to make one dye.  
  
I'll boil it down in an alchemy pot until the jet-black liquid is
bubbling and boiling.  
Stirring it all together, I feel like a witch making a mysterious
potion… except what I'm actually making is a dye.  
  
"Okay, done!"  
  
I made one bottle of black dye. Let's try it. What do I want to dye... a
hat will do..  
I took off my pointed hat and applied the black dye. The change went
into effect immediately, and the hat went from a deep green to black.  
  
Wow...black really suits me!  
  
Wearing my newly dyed hat, I looked in the mirror. Ah, I want to dye my
clothes black too.  
I made five more black dyes to dye my mantle and tunic. I have plenty of
Lady Black in stock. I've been diligently cultivating them along with
medicinal herbs and green herbs for potions.  
  
"Ah, this black outfit is so calming..."  
  
A witch in a black robe stood before the mirror. Deep green wasn't bad,
but black is still my favorite.  
  
Then I decided to make dyes for colors other than black.  
  
Green dye from medicinal herbs and green herbs.  
Red dye from red grass.  
Blue dye from blue roses.  
Yellow dye from yellow lilies.  
White dye from white herbs.  
  
Combining ingredients changed the color.  
  
Combining blue roses and white herbs creates a light blue dye. When
combining different ingredients, you can get a slightly different color
just by changing the number of ingredients you use.  
  
I want to experiment… but I'm running low on materials. I need more
materials… so I'll have to expand the garden…  
  
I held the blue dye up to the light, making it sparkle like a jewel.  
  
For now, Earl is taking care of the garden. I help out, but just the two
of us have our hands full with the fields as they are now. If we make
them any bigger, it'll be difficult to manage them.  
  
"We need more manpower..."  
  
I muttered to myself. Even if that wasn't the case, I’ve been thinking
for a while now that we needed more personnel to help defend this
forest.  
That red-hooded group was surprisingly large. How am I supposed to
handle that alone as the sole Guardian? I need to do something. It could
be an NPC or a player, but I need more allies…  
  
  
  
While making dyes, I also made the potions Miranda-san ordered. It took
a while, partly because my login time has been shorter for the past
couple of days… but it's finally done.  
  
Let's go to Miranda-san's shop to sell the potions and dyes. I can
travel from the log cabin in the Twilight Forest to my house in Dairode
Town with a single door. Dimensional magic is a lifesaver.  
  
When I opened the wooden door imbued with dimensional magic, I wound up
in a bleak looking room. It's so clean, it's unnatural. There's nothing
here… I guess Earl is cleaning it even though it’s not being used.  
  
I spent a fortune buying back this house. I want to make good use of it.
The forest log cabin is enough for a simple house… what should I do?  
  
"Lucille-san, how did you use this house?"  
  
Lucille-san, the former owner, looked up at me and answered.  
  
"Well… I took on jobs related to magic books and worked as an
apothecary, so I used it as a workspace for that. Well, my actual
workspace was the log cabin, though; this house was just a
camouflage."  
"I see… then maybe I'll open an apothecary here."  
  
That would make good use of the house and bring in some money. I have
the important role of Guardian, but I don't get paid. I'll think about
it.  
  
"Oh, are you by any chance the young man from the other day?"  
  
On the way to Miranda-san's shop, Earl, who was walking beside me, was
called out by an old woman.  
  
"It is you! Thank you from the other day."  
  
Apparently, Earl helped her when she broke her cane. The cane she now
has is a new one that Earl made for her, and she said it's very easy to
use and that she's very grateful.  
  
"Oh, that big fellow over there is the one from the other day!"  
  
As we started walking again, a guard spoke to Earl. It turns out Earl
had repaired a poorly fitted door.  
  
"Oh, it's the onii-chan!"  
"Onii-chan~ Thank you for fixing my stuffed animal the other day!"  
"Let's play again later!"  
  
…This time, several children ran up to Earl as soon as they saw him.  
  
"I had no idea you had so many acquaintances in town."  
  
Earl waved his hands frantically as if trying to make excuses, but then
hung his head in defeat.  
…It seems you’ve been coming to town a lot more frequently than I
thought while I’m offline (logged out).  
  
"Welcome~"  
  
Opening the door, a familiar soft voice greeted me.  
  
"Ugh, you…"  
  
At the same time, a slightly displeased voice was heard.  
Among the various products displayed in the store, there was one
particularly eye-catching golden lump near the counter where Miranda-san
was standing.  
  
"Could you not make that disgusted face when you see me, Rush-san? Do I
look that scary?"  
"Every time I see your face, I'm reminded of that time when I got blown
away!!"  
  
I gave Rush-san a bright smile, but it seems to have had the opposite
effect. He looks a little pale.  
  
"Ahahaha! What are you scared of, facing such a cute girl?"  
"Stop it, don't laugh like that!"  
  
Rush-san grimaced further at the cheerful laughter. Looking towards the
source of the laughter, my eyes met red ones.  
  
A female Oni with two white horns. This person… must be the El Dorado
Master I saw before. Unlike then, she's not wearing starting equipment,
but instead a disheveled gold—or rather, yellow—kimono that matches her
hair, and carrying a greatsword on her back.  
  
Next to her stood a gold and white priest. Friday-san was waiting
nearby.  
  
"Long time no see, Chloe-san. Master, this is her."  
"Hello, I've heard about you. It seems you took good care of my
children. I'm Kogane, the clan master of El Dorado."  
"Nice to meet you, I'm Chloe."  
  
I shook the hand she offered with a smile; she grasped it firmly,
shaking it up and down vigorously.  
  
"Well, you really helped us out in the subjugation battle the other day.
Having you there made things easier for us… I wish I could have gone out
too."  
  
Kogane-san muttered regretfully. It seems she was very upset that she
couldn't participate, despite being the leader.  
  
"Hey, do you have any information that might lead to something big like
that happening again?"  
  
Kogane-san leaned in, peering at my face. Her expression was full of
anticipation.  
  
"I don't know anything like that. Besides, I really don't want something
like that to happen again anytime soon."  
  
Chloe doesn't want to think about such an event happening again, I’m
sure. Though I agree with Kogane-san.  
  
"Right… Raid battles of that scale don’t happen often… But do you really
not know anything?"  
"I don't know. Why would you think I know?"  
"That's—no, never mind. Anyways, I wonder…"  
  
She stopped mid-sentence and covered it up with a laugh… it's probably
because of the video.  
  
Since I'm a key person in the story as the Guardian of the Seal, there's
a good chance that I'll get embroiled in something important like
that.  
  
Considering my position, I'm more likely to get information than other
players, so she's probably asking if I know anything that might lead to
an event like the previous one.  
  
"Seriously, it's a shame that such a massive raid battle was a one-off,
and it shows no consideration for other players who couldn't
participate."  
  
As expected, it was Rush-san who was crossing his arms and grumbling.  
  
"What are you saying? That's the heart of this game. Sure, I was
disappointed I couldn't participate this time. But it was a one-time
thing. For those who participated, it became a special, unique memory,
right? In order not to fail in that one chance, you need to get even
more serious than usual. You felt that too, right?"  
"…In the previous game, multiple retries were the norm. That was fun, in
its own way. But it was exhausting being on the spot."  
  
Rush-san replied shyly after Kogane-san said that.  
  
The experiences you have in this game are never repeated. They are
special, unique, and sometimes merciless and cruel. Certain experiences
only become possible because you can't rewind a single moment. Even if
it's unfair in terms of the game, Kogane-san seemed to be saying that
that's fun. If you're dissatisfied with it, you should play another
game.  
  
There are countless other games in the world. If you don't like VR
games, play AR games. They’ve been around for several years. In fact,
there are so many games out there that SSO's existence might be
tolerated just for its novelty. Well, just because it exists doesn't
mean it's the most popular.  
  
In today's world, there are countless forms of entertainment, not just
games. The amount of time people spend on entertainment has increased
drastically compared to the past.  
  
Support robots have been around for over thirty years now, and the world
has changed dramatically.  
Their introduction reduced human labor, creating more free time, and the
entertainment industry flourished. The entertainment industry's growth
is also thanks to machines.  
It's not surprising that some people lost their jobs as machines took
over.  
  
Delivery people have been completely replaced by robots. That goes for
my job too. Although I wasn't around at that time, it was much later...
The entertainment industry, while rapidly growing but still needing
human labor for many jobs, became a haven for those who lost their jobs.
With AR and VR technology advancing and consumer demand increasing, the
entertainment industry grew exponentially… that's the background.  
  
Anyway, setting aside the state of the world… I got sidetracked. I
didn't miss what Rush-san just said, though. Miranda-san and I made eye
contact and exchanged smiles, and then I looked back at Rush-san.  
  
"Hey, why are you smiling?"  
"Oh, nothing~"  
"Yes, nothing at all."  
  
Because it's something we don't understand. Even if you ask "us" (the
characters) who were listening to this conversation, we can't answer
it—regarding what you said about having fun.  
  
"This is also a thank you for the other day, but call on us anytime you
need something. We're, well... a mercenary group! We take on all sorts
of jobs. If there's anything we can help with, be sure to call us."  
"Yes, I'll keep that in mind."  
  
I received a friend code from Kogane-san and gave her mine in return.
Kogane-san, you're someone who talks while incorporating a bit of
role-play into your speech. You might be a bit like Light-kun.  
  
They seemed to be visiting Miranda-san. She's the one who took care of
them the most. And since they were able to level up Kogane-san, they
said they were heading to the Iru Mines. …that’s fast, hasn’t it only
been about three days since the third group started? As expected of a
famous clan.  
  
I ended my conversation with Kogane-san and asked Miranda-san to take a
look at the potions and dyes I had made.  
The potions sold at the usual price. The dyes sold for quite a bit.  
  
There's apparently quite a lot of demand. Until now, there wasn't anyone
making them in this town, so they’re being imported from the royal
capital. She asked me to continue supplying both the potions and dyes.  
  
"Oh, dyes! Do you have gold?"  
"Come to think of it, we need to replenish our clan warehouse stock."  
  
Kogane-san's cheerful voice was heard and Friday-san muttered as if
remembering something. All members of El Dorado dye their outfits gold…
They must consume a lot when changing equipment.  
  
When I told them I didn’t have gold, Kogane-san looked dejected.
Apparently, there’s someone who can make it within the clan, so it’s not
a problem. But she asked me to show her if I ever made any.  
  
I received payment from Miranda-san. After paying Earl his salary, I
have 150,000 gold left.  
  
"Ahh… getting new equipment is still a long way off."  
"Eh, Chloe-chan, you could have bought equipment with the money from the
other day..."  
"It just disappeared due to unavoidable circumstances."  
  
I told her about buying the house and possibly opening a shop there, and
Miranda-san replied with a smile.  
  
"You're short of money? Why don't you go into Iru’s new dungeon?"  
"A dungeon?"  
  
Apparently, when the demonic beast Willamedes emerged from the ground
during the previous incident, the underground mine's terrain changed,
and a new dungeon was discovered.  
  
It's a newly discovered dungeon, so information is scarce, but
apparently a lot of ores have been found and it's a great place to make
money.  
  
Kogane-san and the others plan to challenge the dungeon as soon as they
arrive in Iru.  
  
"We were a well-known clan in Frontier after all. Let's conquer that
dungeon!"  
"Right! Master!"  
"Of course, just make sure you don't cause any trouble for anyone else,
Rush."  
"Y-yes, I know."  
"Come on, Friday, be nice. He seems like he really regrets what he
did."  
  
Kogane-san slapped Rush-san on the back. …Well, even if something
happens, Friday-san and Kogane-san are there, so it’ll be alright.  
  
"A dungeon…huh"  
  
Alright, let's go to this dungeon. It's appealing because I can earn
money, but since it's a dungeon, monsters will appear. This means I'll
get experience points too.  
Unfortunately, even if I want to level up, this area is for beginners.
The monsters around here are beginner-level, and the experience points
they give are minimal.  
  
I can earn money and experience points. This will kill two birds with
one stone.
