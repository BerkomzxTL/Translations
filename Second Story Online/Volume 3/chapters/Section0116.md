# 116・A Fateful Encounter?

"...Yes."  
  
Although she replied softly, she kept staring at my hand, neither trying
to grab it nor getting up. What's wrong? Maybe she got hurt or
something.  
  
"Why are you holding out your hand?"  
"Why... I thought I'd lend a hand to help you get up."  
"Oh... then there's no need for that."  
  
She said that somewhat coldly, and she stood up by herself. Well, it's
good that she wasn't injured.  
  
"..."  
  
Instead of immediately going somewhere after getting up, she looked
around restlessly.  
  
"Are you looking for someone?"  
"I was with someone just now. They're gone now."  
  
It seems she got separated from someone. She must have bumped into me
while searching for them.  
  
"Then, shall we look for them together?"  
"It's alright. They'll find me eventually."  
  
She really seems to think they'll find her. She doesn't seem worried at
all.  
...Rather, she's been expressionless for a while now. So it's hard to
tell what she's thinking about...  
  
"Um, would you like a hot dog?"  
  
They’re the hot dogs that Niru won earlier. Earl is eating one.  
She seemed to have been staring intently at the hot dog in Earl's hand,
since a while ago.  
  
"Yes, please."  
  
I took her to a nearby bench and sat down. She took the hot dog I
offered her in her porcelain-white hands. After taking it, she stared at
it again without trying to eat it.  
  
"...Maybe you don't know how to eat it?"  
"I've never had one before."  
  
It seems my guess was right.  
  
"You eat it like this."  
  
I picked up another hot dog and took a bite. The sausage sandwiched
between the buns had a crispy skin when I bit into it, juicy and
delicious. The sweet and spicy taste of the mustard and ketchup was also
nice.  
  
"...!"  
  
Seeing me eat, she tentatively took a bite. After that, she nibbled in
small bites at a fast pace. It's like a squirrel eating nuts.  
  
"It's delicious."  
"Delicious...?"  
"You're eating because one bite isn't enough and you want more, right?
That's because the hot dog is delicious."  
"Yes... it's delicious."  
"Hehe. You have ketchup on your mouth."  
  
She seemed to be too engrossed in eating to notice. I'll use the
handkerchief Earl made and wipe it for her.  
  
She's strange... or rather, naive. If she's never eaten a hot dog, she
wouldn't know it's delicious. She's wearing a plain overcoat, looking
like a traveler, yet she doesn’t seem to know anything.  
Although her age seems to be almost the same as Chloe's, she feels like
a newborn child in some ways.  
  
"Where did you come from?"  
" ...I don't know. Nowhere."  
"Then, did you come to see this festival with the person you were
with?"  
"No."  
  
Her purpose wasn't the festival. Hmm, perhaps she just happened to visit
this town with that someone she was with. Still...what are her guardians
doing? Leaving a child like this alone is dangerous.  
  
"Hey, look! Isn't that the new lord?"  
"Let's go take a look!"  
  
The street became noisy. It seems the new lord is at the square. Is she
the star of this festival? I'm a little curious and want to go see her.
Besides, I've been curious about the square.  
  
But... what should I do with this child? Let's see...  
  
"Until your guardian appears, since it's such a nice festival, why don't
we enjoy it together?"  
  
I can't leave this child alone. Plus, I also have the purpose of finding
her guardian. The square is spacious and many people are gathered there
now. Her guardian might be there too.  
The girl, with her blank expression and white skin, stared at me
silently for a while, then slowly opened her mouth.  
  
"...Okay."  
"Good. By the way, I haven’t introduced myself yet. I'm Chloe."  
  
I offered my hand for a handshake, and again, she just stared at my
hand.  
  
"...I didn't fall down."  
"That's not it. When introducing yourself, you shake hands."  
  
I didn't expect her to take it that way. I chuckled lightly and
explained, and she gently placed her hand on mine.  
  
"I'm Mietia."  
"Mietia-san, nice to meet you."  
"Nice to meet you... Chloe-sama."  
  
When I properly grasped the hand she had placed on mine, she shook my
hand back.  
  
  
As we headed towards the square, lively music came into earshot. There’s
a live orchestra playing nearby. A folk dance was being performed in the
square to the music.  
  
"Now, now, enjoy this bright day to the fullest! The joy of the
residents is my joy!"  
"Long live the new lord!"  
"Hooray!"  
  
That seems to be the new lord of Dairode. A woman with lustrous platinum
blonde hair styled in braids. A crimson dress that accentuates her
well-proportioned figure elegantly enhances her charm, making her
presence stand out even in this crowded place.  
I believe she's the only daughter of the previous lord. It seems she
succeeded her father as lord.  
  
Well, I looked around for a while... but nothing else caught my eye.
Mietia-san's companion hasn't appeared either.  
  
"Since we're here, shall we dance?"  
  
The song that was playing had just ended, and the next was about to
start. Also, if we dance in the center, it might be easier for someone
looking for her to spot her.  
  
"...I don't know how to dance."  
"I'll lead you, so it's alright. This is a gesture to invite someone to
dance. If it's okay, please place your hand on mine?"  
  
Saying that, I extended my hand to Mietia-san. She stared at it
intently, but slowly placed her hand on mine. I clasped it back as if
handling a fragile object.  
  
"Then, Earl, we're going to dance. I'll dance with you next, so please
study up!"  
  
Earl nodded, and I took Mietia-san's hand and went to the center of the
square. I started stepping to the music.  
Honestly, I'm not very good at dancing either, but I was able to study
somewhat from watching the people a while ago. Besides, I'm a former
noble lady. My skill effect seems to have been activated, so there’s no
problem with my movements.  
  
"Okay, next to the right... then left."  
"Right... Left..."  
  
At first, Mietia-san's movements were clumsy, but she gradually got used
to it.  
  
"Fufu, it's fun."  
"Fun..."  
  
At first, she repeated my words as if she didn't understand their
meaning.  
  
"...Yes, it's fun."  
  
After a pirouette, her expression was still the same as before, but it
seemed like there was a slight smile on her mouth.  
  
"—So this is where you were, Mietia."  
"Ah..."  
  
Another hand suddenly appeared, snatching Mietia-san's hand from mine.  
Behind Mietia-san, a person wearing the same black coat and hood as her
had silently appeared, taking her hand. This person must be the
companion Mietia-san was looking for.  
  
"It seems that you took good care of my companion. Thank you...
but..."  
  
The hood covered his face. But I know. I know who it is.  
  
"Well, well... I thought you were a pretty young lady, but you're Chloe.
Your outfit is different from last time, so I didn't recognize you."  
"And you're dressed rather plainly. What happened to your usual flashy
clothes, Ignis?"  
  
I could see a hateful smile under the hood. Ignis... to meet the person
I was looking for in such a way.  
  
"...What are you going to do with that child?"  
"Do? This child is one of our companions. I just came to pick her up
after she got lost."  
"Mietia-san, is that true?"  
"Yes. I was told to act together with Ignis-sama."  
  
It seems it's true. I can't read Mietia-san's expression, but she
doesn't seem unhappy.  
  
"Then, Mietia-san, let's go."  
"Wait!"  
"Oh, if you're going to attack, we won't hold back either. Our allies
are hiding everywhere. If I give the signal... you know what will
happen, right?"  
  
The hand reaching for a weapon stopped. The music continued to resonate
around us, and the voices of jubilant people could be heard... Are their
companions hidden among these people? If they weren't wearing red hoods,
they would be indistinguishable from ordinary people.  
The person dancing next to me might be one of them. Or perhaps someone
watching from afar.  
  
"...Damn it!"  
  
While I was distracted by my surroundings, the two disappeared into the
crowd. It’ll be difficult to find them in this crowd with their plain
clothes now.  
Judging from his tone, they didn't seem to have come to this festival
with malicious intent. So, they were just here by chance.  
However... I'm still curious about that girl, Mietia-san. She said she
was a companion, but who is she, exactly?  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
"Actually, Mietia is my character!"  
  
So casually. My friend revealed her true identity so casually.  
This is the Phantom City. After receiving a call from my friend, I came
here, and the friend who was playing as Mietia-san was there. And
Ignis... is also here in the Phantom City.  
  
"When Ignis-san showed up... I had a feeling it might be you, but I
never imagined that would actually be the case."  
"Hehe. I didn't intend to deceive you, but I'm sorry I didn't say
anything, okay?"  
  
My friend, Mietia-san, was giggling with joy. Where did that girl from
just now go, the one whose facial muscles seemed dead... Well, that must
have been role-playing.  
  
"If I had known it was you, I might have tried harder to separate her
forcibly... Ah, if only I wasn’t surrounded by enemies..."  
"Actually, there were no companions other than Ignis-san, so you might
have been able to take her away if you wanted to?"  
"Eh, is that true!?"  
  
I couldn’t help but look at Ignis-san. He had an expression like, "You
shouldn't have said that..."  
  
"The thing about having friends was a bluff..."  
"...Certainly, only the two of us were clearly there. But, you can't
exactly call it a complete bluff. In our organization, during peacetime,
the members take off their hoods and mingle among the common people.
They blend into everyday life, watching for opportunities to lead them
into Chaos. So—"  
"...If you think they're there, they're there, right? But, is that even
possible?"  
"—With this world's system (Word Link System), don't you think it's
possible?"  
  
...When you put it that way, I might think it's possible.  
With that organization's setting, it wouldn’t be strange for them to be
in that town. Moreover, there was the recent drug incidents... the
conditions for them to appear are right. If they had really shown up,
they would have probably been NPC organization members.  
  
"Anyway... did you come to that town for some purpose?"  
"Ah haha, it's not for us to say—"  
"It was for my leveling up. Ignis-san was helping me with it."  
"Ahhhhh!! That's the one thing you should never say!!!"  
  
Ignis-san hastily covered her mouth, but it was too late.  
  
"Oh my! That's how it is. Thank you for going to such trouble for my
friend."  
"Stop it... Don't bow your head and show your gratitude!!"  
  
How rude. I was only thanking him for his kindness.  
Jokes aside. Well, my friend is just starting out. If she wants to level
up, she needs a place with low-level monsters. That means she needs to
use the Dairode area as a hunting ground.  
  
But they're villain organization characters. They can’t act openly, so
they have to do it secretly like that. And the sight of villains working
hard... makes them seem comical.  
At least, Ignis-san, who is determined to be a villain, would think so,
and it seems likely that he himself hides such behavior.  
  
"Well, now you know what kind of character she's playing."  
"...Could it be that you deliberately arranged our meeting?"  
"No way. It was a coincidence!"  
  
Chloe met Mietia-san because she found her lost in the town. If they had
met normally, they might have been enemies without exchanging a word.  
  
"Thank you so much."  
"Stop thanking the villain!"  
  
Ignis-san crossed his arms, pouting and turning his face away.  
I'm not sure of the exact details, but it seems alright to entrust my
friend to them.  
...Well, as for Mietia-san, I can only feel anxious!
