SSO General Thread Part 663  
  
521://Anonymous 2  
I thought we had a truce a while ago, but now we're at war again.
Hilarious.  
  
522://Anonymous 2  
It can’t be helped, given the brutal nature of the Three Kingdoms.  
  
524://Anonymous 2  
It's unavoidable. The players in the three kingdoms are all
combat-obsessed immigrants from Magic War…  
  
526://Anonymous 2  
SSO's war system is almost exactly like Magic War's, just with a few
differences.  
  
527://Anonymous 2  
Magic War… nostalgic. Has it really been three years since the service
ended?  
  
527://Anonymous 2  
The game system was good… but the management was terrible…  
  
529://Anonymous 2  
\>526 I heard the development teams are the same. It's no wonder they're
similar.  
  
532://Anonymous 2  
\>529 Oh yeah, NR picked up the development team.  
  
536://Anonymous 2  
A story of a tragic masterpiece representing the VRMMO Warring States
Period?  
  
538://Anonymous 2  
I'm a Magic War refugee. When's the lottery announcement for the third
round?  
  
540://Anonymous 2  
\>538 Fellow soldiers. I also want to know the lottery results soon.  
  
542://Anonymous 2  
I'm one of the beta dropouts, so I want to know too.  
  
543://Anonymous 2  
Demon Creature refugees are also waiting for the lottery results.  
  
546://Anonymous 2  
When did SSO become a refugee camp?  
  
547://Anonymous 2  
This place has been a refugee camp from the start.  
  
548://Anonymous 2  
Not only MW and DC refugees, but also RP refugees scattered from various
games, and VRMMO refugees who were NR company fans!  
  
549://Anonymous 2  
I think the lottery announcement will come soon. The second phase was
around this time too.  
  
550://Anonymous 2  
\>548 DC refugees have spread through word of mouth, so it's practically
been since the second phase!  
  
551://Anonymous 2  
\>543 Hello, non-human from a non-human game!  
  
552://Anonymous 2  
\>543 Of course you're coming to the demon race, right? Please come!  
  
553://Anonymous 2  
Aggressive demon race recruitment.  
  
554://Anonymous 2  
Maybe because it's a demonic land full of inhuman monsters, the player
population is low, so recruitment is intense.  
  
556://Anonymous 2  
Is the lunar service launch still pending?  
  
557://Anonymous 2  
Haven't epic quests been popping up a lot lately? Am I imagining things?
When I look at the history, I'm surprised to see that 50 of them are
happening in a day.  
  
558://Anonymous 2  
Aren't there too many players from other games? Frontier people and LOF
people are here too, right?  
  
559://Anonymous 2  
It seems to be the influence of the first-phase role-players starting to
seriously get active.  
  
560://Anonymous 2  
\>556 Aaaahh! It's an extraterrestrial life form!  
  
561://Anonymous 2  
\>556 Enjoy yourself at the amusement park over there!!  
  
562://Anonymous 2  
\>556 Please don't come because lag players will appear.  
  
563://Anonymous 2  
\>558 Nowadays, VRMMO beginners are mostly kids under the VR eligible
age. Most of them have some experience with other games.  
  
565://Anonymous 2  
I died for the first time, but there was no reincarnation bonus.  
  
567://Anonymous 2  
Go to the verification thread instead. They're looking for
information.  
  
558://Anonymous 2  
Welcome, deceased! Funeral thread is here → \[SSO verification
thread\]  
  
559://Anonymous 2  
It's not a funeral thread, it's a role-play thread. This is the correct
one → \[SSO Verification Thread\]  
  
560://Anonymous 2  
Don't call the verification thread that, everyone worked hard on it...  
  
  
///////////////////////////////////  
  
SSO Verification Thread Part 310  
  
347://Dead Villager  
So here are the results of this test.  
If a character plays the role of a villager for a month, and then
suddenly dies, having a priest declare their death and holding a funeral
with an NPC, will the character who died be considered dead?  
  
Verification result: The system judged death and the character was
lost.  
  
The character was alive with full health until the death judgment.  
I will look into the information about reincarnation later.  
  
348://Passing Priest  
\>347 Thank you for your hard work. I was worried whether I could
properly act as a priest, but I'm glad that you died safely.  
  
350://Passing Acquaintance A  
\>347 Congratulations. I was there as a participant, and both your
acting skills were amazing. I ended up crying along with the other
villagers.  
  
352://Anonymous 2  
Oh, this time the priest wasn't a bad actor. I'm looking forward to the
video going up on History. Anyway, good job.  
  
351://Passing Acquaintance B  
Congrats. \>352 The last one was terrible. The corpse actor was
laughing, so the test failed.  
  
355://Anonymous 2  
The verification thread is recruiting the following personnel:  
・Those who can patiently conduct verifications  
・Those confident in their acting abilities  
・Those not interested in verification but confident in their acting
abilities  
  
356://Anonymous 2  
A testing method you won't see in other games…  
  
357://Anonymous 2  
Because it's SSO! The fact that events are determined by role-playing
skills is pretty crazy.  
  
358://Anonymous 2  
Well, there are other VRMMOs, so I think it's good to have a unique one
like this.  
  
360://Anonymous 2  
If you want a normal one, you can play other games. Like Frontier.  
  
361://Anonymous 2  
Compared to the inhuman game group, SSO is still a normal game. Well, if
you don't role-play, it's just an average fantasy game.  
  
362://Anonymous 2  
Don’t talk about the reason why early users dropped off  
  
365://Anonymous 2  
It's been more stable since RP became more popular. Is the third phase
mostly that kind of group?  
  
366://Anonymous 2  
Apparently there are spectators due to the History videos.  
  
367://Anonymous 2  
Honestly, I wish the number of people in the verification thread would
increase. It's difficult to test because it requires role-playing.  
  
369://Dead Villager  
As a result of death, I was treated as reincarnated and had to recreate
the character. However, it's different from the first time in various
ways.  
  
Here's the information I've gathered regarding skills:  
  
Starting at level 1.  
  
Skills the previous character knew seem to be inheritable, and they are
added to the learnable initial skills. But there's a note that you can
only choose them at character creation.  
If you try to learn them after the game starts, you'll need to take more
actions to learn them again.  
Furthermore, skills that are not learned will not be added.  
  
When acquiring a skill, the SP required for special skills is reduced.  
Even skills with a fixed SP of 3 were 1, so it seems to be fixed at 1?
There doesn't seem to be any SP increase due to the number of skills
acquired.  
  
Skill points from the previous character don't seem to transfer over.
But I received 30 initial SP, and as mentioned above, all skills can be
acquired with 1 SP, so I can start with 30 skills.  
  
In exchange, the number of basic skill slots was reset to the initial
30.  
My previous character had 32 slots…  
It seems that the number of slots is not inheritable, and the SP used to
increase the number of slots hasn't been returned.  
  
I will investigate my birth and background now.  
  
370://Anonymous 2  
\>369 Thanks for your hard work. Wow, there are more restrictions than
you'd expect...  
  
371://Anonymous 2  
\>369 Thanks. I'm starting at level 1. Well, in this game, level is
almost meaningless anyway, so it doesn't matter.  
  
372://Passing Acquaintance A  
\>369 thx It seems like there's not much benefit to dying in this
case.  
  
373://Anonymous 2  
\>371 It's been like that since about level 50. The skill level cap is
50.  
  
374://Anonymous 2  
\>373 Speaking of, unique skills don't show level, so aren't they
effectively treated as level 50?  
  
375://Passing Acquaintance B  
\>374 They're only treated that way when calculating level requirements,
but it's basically level 50. Unlike basic skills, you can't increase the
level cap with SP.  
  
376://Dead Villager  
Regarding birth and background:  
There were a few more things to choose from than at the start.  
Also, there's a note that because I've been reincarnated, the random
results are adjusted to be better.  
This adjustment is also influenced by the actions of the previous
character.  
  
And the result of trying it… I got royalty as my birth, and chosen by
the stars as my background.  
  
377://Anonymous 2  
Seriously?!  
  
378://Anonymous 2  
\>376 I'm jealous of heroes!  
  
379://Anonymous 2  
\>378 Not all star bearers are heroes…never mind.  
  
380://Anonymous 2  
It was abused at the beginning, but now it’s becoming official that star
bearer = hero.  
  
381://Anonymous 2  
Who said there was no benefit to death earlier?! There are tons of
benefits!  
  
382://Anonymous 2  
The way you play this game changes quite a bit depending on your
surroundings...  
  
383://Passing Acquaintance A  
Test proposal: If a funeral is held only with players and no NPCs, will
the player character die?  
Funeral in Duo Region. Recruiting priest and attendees. I'll be the
corpse.  
  
384://Passing Acquaintance B  
\>383 You're totally aiming for the reincarnation bonus!  
  
385://Passing Priest Role  
Anyone interested in playing the next corpse? Accepting applications now
for a funeral fee of 100 star coins.  
  
386://Anonymous 2  
Priest, you too?!  
  
387://Anonymous 2  
Is anyone going to hold a funeral in the Tessera region? I'll be the
corpse.  
  
388://Anonymous 2  
…What thread is this again?  
  
389://Anonymous 2  
This is the verification thread. It's not a role-play thread or a
funeral thread.  
  
  
////////////////////////////////////////////////////  
  
Let's Talk About History! \#232  
  
120://Anonymous 2  
The previous incident from Iru the other day finally made it to
History.  
  
123://Anonymous 2  
\>120 Iru? What's that?  
  
124://Anonymous 2  
I don't know, there are so many videos being added to History
recently.  
  
126://Anonymous 2  
\>123 I think it's \#523 that was posted today. Is this the first time
something other than a war has had this many players participate?  
  
127://Anonymous 2  
\>126 \#465 also had a decent number if it was spontaneous.  
  
128://Anonymous 2  
\>124 I'm happy about that as a viewer. It's really fun to watch videos
of skillful, professional stories and amateur role-play videos.  
  
129://Anonymous 2  
That one had quite a few people too…. But it happened in the demon
territory, so the number of players didn't increase that much.  
  
132://Anonymous 2  
The Iru Mining Town one is pretty long.  
  
133://Anonymous 2  
\>128 I understand. I'm also a spectator. In my case, I like watching
NPCs. It makes me happy to see my old friends doing well.  
  
135://Anonymous 2  
The El Dorado guys were quite helpful. Famous clans are different,
huh.  
  
136://Anonymous 2  
There are a lot of viewers, but while recorded videos are interesting,
it's also fun to watch the live atmosphere as a spectator!  
  
137://Anonymous 2  
\>133 I can see their iron skin.  
  
140://Anonymous 2  
\>136 Sorry, I'm a viewer who doesn't play the game, so I can't be a
live spectator.  
  
142://Anonymous 2  
\>140 That's a shame. You can see the interactions between players that
aren't recorded in History, which is interesting.  
  
143://Anonymous 2  
\>142 That's right, I saw something interesting in Iru this time. The
showdown between the Red Hood with quadruple casting and the Grass Witch
was amazing, but it wasn't included in History.  
  
144://Anonymous 2  
\>143 As a fellow spectator, I'm curious. If you have a video, please
show it to me.  
  
145://Anonymous 2  
\>143 I'm also curious, so show me.  
  
146://Anonymous 2  
I only recorded halfway through, but → \[Video\]  
  
148://Anonymous 2  
\>146 What is this?!  
  
149://Anonymous 2  
\>146 The quadruple casting is amazing, but is the counter really to eat
grass?!  
  
150://Anonymous 2  
Huh, quadruple casting really? Since getting triple is 60, is their
skill level higher than that?  
  
151://Anonymous 2  
\>143 Hey, I can't hear the two of them talking clearly!  
  
153://Anonymous 2  
\>151 Even if they were using stealth skills, it can’t be helped since
they were far away to avoid being noticed!  
  
155://Anonymous 2  
That quadruple casting is definitely an engraving technique. From its
usage, power, and the number of rings maxed out… it's clearly the magic
passed down by the Unirei Mage Duke's family. So that means it's their
wanted son, and he's here?  
  
156://Anonymous 2  
\>155 As expected from the special investigation team, quick work.  
  
157://Anonymous 2  
\>155 Wait, the Duke had a child?! I was talking to him without
knowing...  
  
158://Anonymous 2  
\>157 He has a daughter too. Well, the daughter was killed by the son,
right?  
  
160://Anonymous 2  
\>158 That's right. Plus it seems like the setting was added by the son
(player). They've been in Unirei since the first season, but the
daughter's setting wasn't there at first. I might have missed it
though.  
  
161://Anonymous 2  
That guy's a player…  
  
162://Anonymous 2  
\>146 Ahahaha! This video is hilarious! I'm glad I saw this. Thanks!  
  
163://Anonymous 2  
I'm curious about the witch on the other side. Because she summoned the
NPC Lucille at the end.  
  
164://Anonymous 2  
\>162 What was so funny about that...?  
  
165://Anonymous 2  
\>163 Ah, I was curious about that too.  
  
166://Anonymous 2  
\>161 I saw them in the Phantom City with green text, so they are
definitely a player.  
  
168://Anonymous 2  
\>163 Since I'm watching red beast-related things, it's probably related
to the Guardians.  
  
169://Anonymous 2  
\>168 It's not probably, that witch is a Guardian. That's the fifth
one.  
  
170://Anonymous 2  
But that quadruple casting is strong. Although the power is low, I'm
surprised she was able to win against it.  
  
173://Anonymous 2  
The outcome is unclear though  
  
175://Anonymous 2  
\>170 No, it was an easy win. Even without prior knowledge, you can
figure out the mechanism once you see it, and the magic is cast without
chanting and takes 0.5 seconds to hit, so agility-specialized characters
can avoid it. Plus, from what I saw in the video, it's essentially
double casting. Even if you take the first hit, the power is low, so you
won't die, and there's a 1-second gap until the next double cast, so you
can easily avoid it.  
  
  
176: // Anonymous User 2  
But everyone knows the setting so well... Is it because they've been
watching videos a lot?  
  
178: // Anonymous User 2  
\>175 Don't say that so easily. I'm an agile type, but I don't think I
can avoid it...  
  
179: // Anonymous User 2  
\>175 You're Ace, aren't you? Or are you a Psychic Sonic fan!? Don't
talk about your superhuman player skill level!  
  
180: // Anonymous User 2  
\>176 It might have been different in the early days, but now
information sites are well-established. However, if you're a
role-player, you're better off not watching. There's a ton more spoilers
than in the videos.  
  
183: // Anonymous User 2  
\>179 I'm not as superhuman as Ace! I'm just a low-ranked player who can
play PS a little!  
  
184: // Anonymous User 2  
\>183 The fact that you can play that game makes you superhuman
enough!  
  
185: // Anonymous User 2  
\>180 I'm a role-player, but I don't mind spoilers, so I might check it
out?  
  
186: // Anonymous User 2  
There’s been a lot of superhuman players lately... Is it because of
"that" three years ago?  
  
187: // Anonymous User 2  
\>185 Hey, stop it. It'll interfere with your role-playing.  
  
189: // Anonymous User 2  
\>186 There have been superhuman-like players since VR started eight
years ago, so it's not that. Well, it's like the powers hidden within
humanity have manifested...probably.  
  
190: // Anonymous User 2  
\>185 The PS service started five years ago. Ace was there back then.  
  
191: // Anonymous User 2  
\>185 Did you know? Chaos' true identity is actually a Star God?  
  
192: // Anonymous User 2  
\>185 Did you know that demons also have star bearers?  
  
193: // Anonymous User 2  
\>185 Hey, did you know? The Chaos Dragon was a Demon King!  
  
194: // Anonymous User 2  
\>185 The female hero is a fake hero created by the church, not chosen
by a star!  
  
195: // Anonymous User 2  
\>185 The Star Hero Astrea is said to be missing, but she's actually
dead!  
  
197: // Anonymous User 2  
Stop giving out so many spoilers!  
  
198: // Anonymous User 2  
Hey, I got spoiled! Hey!  
  
199: // Anonymous User 2  
\>195 There have been reports of Astrea's survival, so there shouldn't
be any rumours that she's dead!  
  
200: // Anonymous User 2  
\>199 But I heard it's a rumor.  
  
201: // Anonymous User 2  
Why does everyone know so much...  
  
202: // Anonymous User 2  
Players who don't care about spoilers tend to have more information
about the setting than casual role-players.  
  
203: // Anonymous User 2  
Role-playing is a kind of self-imposed restriction...  
  
  
////////////////////////////////////////////////////  
  
  
"Okay, let's pretend I didn't see that!"  
  
I quickly closed the screen I was looking at and tried to forget the
information I had just seen.  
  
...No, no, there's no way I can forget it. What kind of spoilers were
those?  
  
Chaos is actually a Star God? A fake hero? And Astrea is dead?  
Aren't these settings that would normally be revealed near the end of a
normal game!? Where did they learn that!?  
  
I found myself reading along because they were talking about me, but...
I shouldn't have looked...  
  
Even if I wish I could forget the information I just saw, my brain
conveniently won't let me forget it. Usually I forget important
information, but... well, that's just how the human brain is.  
  
Still...  
  
"The Grass Witch, are you kidding me!?"  
  
Anger was welling up inside me at that unknown person who called me
that. At least call me the Herbivorous Witch! Though I don’t really like
that either.  
But... I guess my identity as a Guardian has been revealed after all.
Since I've been suspected before, now that this much information is out,
it'd be strange if I wasn't exposed.  
  
I hope people don't come to the forest again...
