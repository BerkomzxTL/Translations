# 111・Things Picked Up on Accident

"Hey Chloe! Thanks for your help the other day."  
"Oh, Oliver-kun! Fancy meeting you here."  
  
Oliver-kun was in Miranda-san's shop. He's a dwarf, and rather short, so
I almost missed him hiding in the shadows. Still, it's unusual to see
him here, a dwarven craftsman based in the Iru Mining Town.  
  
"Why are you here?"  
"Ah, apparently a merchant ship is coming to Sealink. A market's
supposed to be opening, so I thought I'd go take a look. I just happened
to come here to show my face."  
"I was also curious about the market. Let's go together~"  
  
Speaking of Sealink... if I remember correctly, that's the name of a
port town a little ways from Dairode Town. It's on the opposite side
from the Twilight Forest, so I haven't been there much. I've never
really had a reason to go there in the first place. Also, it seems there
was a regular ferry between the royal capital and the town, but the
presence of monsters means that it doesn’t come here often anymore.  
  
"...Hm? Wasn't it because of the sea monsters that the ships couldn't
come?"  
"Well~, apparently those monsters were defeated. Someone on a recent
transport ship apparently reeled them in and took care of them~"  
"Oh, is that so..."  
  
...Reeled in and defeated monsters?  
  
"Could that have been the fisherman from the other day?"  
  
I remember him. I met him in this shop before. He's from my home region,
and the one who fished up the holy sword.  
  
"You think so, Chloe-chan? I thought so too~ But it's just a rumor, so
we don't know for sure~. Well anyway, thanks to that, apparently they
managed to deal with the pirates, so regular ships and merchant ships
are coming again~"  
  
Is that fisherman actually an amazing person? I don't know the truth...
but whatever the case, the sea route seems to be safe again.  
  
"Hey, Chloe-chan, why don't you come to Sealink too? You might be able
to buy some rare items~"  
  
Hmm, that might be a good idea. The glass skull that Miranda-san
tricked… no, sold me before was also a rare item. I might be able to get
some valuable items that aren't available around here.  
  
"Do you think there might be materials that could be used to make a
staff?"  
"Probably. I heard they have items for craftsmen from Iru like me."  
  
This will be perfect for finding materials for the staff Earl is
making.  
  
"Then it's settled. I'll go with you."  
"Really? Yay~"  
  
Miranda-san looks very happy. Having Miranda-san, a merchant, and
Oliver-kun, a craftsman, with me will also help me avoid becoming a
victim of scams and being ripped off.  
  
"By the way, Oliver-kun, I wanted to ask you something."  
"What is it?"  
"I'd like you to make an accessory using this \[Moonlight Stone\]."  
  
I showed Oliver-kun the \[Moonlight Stone\] I got as a drop.  
  
\[Moonlight Stone\]  
A white stone that shines by gathering moonlight. It turns gray when the
gathered light is gone.  
  
Oliver-kun is an accessory craftsman. I've been wanting to commission
him to make something with this.  
  
"Hmm...if you want it that badly, it's not just an ordinary accessory,
is it?"  
"Right. Apparently, it has the property of gathering moonlight. I was
wondering if I could utilize that power."  
  
With a magic ore like \[Amethyst\], you can increase the power of magic
attributes. This \[Moonlight Stone\] doesn't seem to have such
properties, but the description says it gathers moonlight.  
I thought maybe I could use that light. I have a skill called
\[Moonlight\]. My stats go up when I'm under the light of the moon. So
if I can use the moonlight this stone gathers, I might be able to get
the effect even during the day, or in places where moonlight doesn't
reach.  
  
"That's true, but... it's just flavor text... no, I can't say flavor
text has no meaning in this game."  
  
Oliver-kun folded his arms, lost in thought. He's right. Even flavor
text has meaning in this game.  
  
"Okay. I'll give it a try. It might not turn out exactly how you want it
to, but is that okay?"  
"Yes, please."  
  
So, I commissioned Oliver-kun to make an accessory.  
  
"And then, one more thing, Oliver-kun. Do you accept repair work? It's
not an accessory though..."  
"What is it? Let me see."  
  
I took out a \[Broken Cauldron\] from my item box. This is the cauldron
that was in Lucille-san's house. It's used for advanced alchemy, but
it's broken and unusable.  
  
"I can probably fix this with my metalworking skills."  
"Then, would you please?"  
"I'm not a handyman, but... never mind. I'll fix it while I'm at it."  
  
I knew Oliver-kun could fix it. So I asked him.  
  
"Can I ask for one more thing?"  
"What is it now...?"  
"What is this? It looks like something I picked up in the dungeon the
other day... but I don't know what it is."  
  
I took out two small red and blue unidentified spheres. I found them
when I was organizing my items from the dungeon, but I don’t have an
appraisal skill, so I don’t know what they are.  
I handed them to Oliver-kun for appraisal, and he stared at them
intently.  
  
"Um, this is... Oh, come on, seriously?"  
  
He must have finished appraising them. His eyes seemed to follow the
words in the information window, but then he looked surprised.  
  
"\[Magic Defense Twin Orbs\]... this is a rare drop from the boss!"  
  
The \[Silver Ridge Guardian\], the dungeon boss, the two orbs that gave
invincibility effects... apparently, this item was those gems.  
  
"If I use this, can I get the same invincibility effect as before...?"  
"No, you can't use them as they are. Shall I make something with them?
Although, it will probably be a one-time item..."  
"If I can get an invincibility effect even if it's a consumable item,
that's great. Please make something with them."  
"Man, my workload just increased... Oh well. I'll charge extra for
this!"  
  
Oliver-kun seemed pleased to be able to make equipment from rare
materials. He looks a little excited.  
Now that my dealings with Oliver-kun are over, let's go to the market.  
  
"Klin~ I'm going to close up shop~"  
"In that case, I'll look after the shop—"  
"No way! Klin's coming with us! I’ll never leave you alone again!"  
"Oh... I guess there's nothing I can do about it. Well, I wanted to go
too, so it's fine."  
  
Miranda-san pulled Klin-kun's arm, and he grumbled, but he looks happy.
Considering what happened last time when Klin-kun fell under the
influence of Chaos, it's understandable that Miranda-san is being
overprotective.  
  
So, I went to the port town of Sealink with Miranda-san, Klin-kun, and
Oliver-kun. Of course, Niru, Earl, and Lucille-san are coming too.
