# 121・War Games

"A state of war..."  
  
The window that appeared announced that the two countries had entered a
state of war, and there was a button to choose which side to join. It
said that we are currently in the preparation period for war, so it
doesn't seem like it'll start anytime soon.  
  
"So, the teams are clearly divided?"  
  
This is my first experience with war, but there are proper rules, aren't
there? Although it's natural in a game, when role-playing, you tend to
forget that and perceive it as reality.  
  
"Is this your first war in this game, you two?"  
"Yes, it is."  
"I... no, it's my first time as well."  
"It's my first time too... but I pretty much know the drill, so let me
explain."  
  
Perhaps because John-san wasn't role-playing, Tsubaki-san decided not to
either. Well, the content of the following conversation is going to be
meta-heavy anyway, so it’s fine.  
  
"Now, if this were a small skirmish, it wouldn't be like this, but
because it's a fight between countries, a massive number of people will
be involved, resulting in many casualties. But, since this is a game,
you won't die easily, right? Besides, there's a setting where players
and NPCs alike are revived around the Star Stele. It’s the same in war.
...But if the revival point is the same for both armies, it would be
utter chaos, wouldn't it?"  
  
...Indeed, during the previous incident in Iru Town, players and the Red
Hood gang clashed around the Star Stele, the revival point, creating a
terrible scene.  
  
"That's why we have team divisions. We clearly define the revival
points, so that you can only revive from the stele located in the
territory of the army you chose. By the way, during wartime, the Star
Stele's power is used at full capacity, so there's no death penalty; you
can die as much as you want."  
"Heeh, that's nice."  
  
During the Iru Town incident, there were times when the death penalty
hindered our movements. If that’s gone, we can fully engage in player
versus player combat.  
  
"Well, it's not like you can die infinitely."  
"What do you mean?"  
"The Star Stele's power is limited. The revival power... points are
predetermined. Every time someone revives, one point is deducted; it's
like remaining lives. What happens when these points gradually
decrease?"  
"We won't be able to revive anymore... is that it?"  
"You got it right, Ninja-chan! If that happens, you can no longer defend
the area where the Star Stele is located, so you have no choice but to
retreat. As a result, that area is considered occupied."  
  
John-san nodded in agreement with Tsubaki-san's words.  
In other words... you need to defeat a large number of enemies, deplete
the Star Stele's power first, and then expand the front lines and the
controlled territory.  
  
"The more frequently you revive in a short period, the more you consume
the Stele's power. Apparently, the setting is that a minimum amount of
power is left in the Stele even when it's passed to the enemy. For the
inhabitants of this world, losing the Star Stele is something both
friend and foe want to avoid. Also, seizing control from the Stele's
administrator... namely, the lord or someone like that, will also be
recognized by the system as occupying that area."  
"Carlyle, you're late."  
"I told you, it's Kyle."  
  
Kyle-san entered the room, adding to the world setting explanation. He
was carrying a tea set. …It seems he had accepted the task of bringing
the tea John-san had ordered earlier on his way here.  
  
"Tsubaki-san's here too. What's going on?"  
"It'll take a while to explain, but... would you like to hear it?"  
  
Apparently he just logged in. Maybe John-san called him.  
When Tsubaki-san briefly explained how she ended up here, he laughed,
saying, "That's so Tsubaki."  
If Light-kun were here, he would have immediately confronted
Tsubaki-san.  
  
"By the way, where’s Light-kun?"  
  
Because he’s always so inconspicuous, I was wondering if his presence
had finally vanished entirely, but it seems he truly isn’t here.  
  
"I did contact him, but... it's early morning in his time zone, so he's
probably sleeping."  
"That's quite possible."  
  
I glanced at the real-time clock displayed on the edge of my vision.  
In some parts of the world, some countries were welcoming the morning,
while others were experiencing night.  
Today’s a holiday, but the morning of a holiday is the time for sleeping
in.  
Light-kun is probably in a dream world different from this one right
now.  
  
"Still... Sealink is already a part of the Laptalica territory..."  
  
Kyle-san seemed to be looking at the map window. I decided to look at
the map as well.  
Swaro and Laptalica are already at war. The territories of both
countries were color-coded for easy understanding.  
Swaro is white, and Laptalica is purple. Dairode and its surrounding
areas are white, but Sealink is colored purple.  
  
"Securing a foothold territory just before the war... it's a tactic
sometimes seen in the southern Shura Kingdom."  
  
Once war begins, it's difficult to secure territory. Due to the war
system, you can't seize territory without depleting points. However, if
you can take the territory without starting a war, you can avoid all
that trouble.  
  
"Um… I have a question... why did Laptalica decide to attack from here?
If they divide their forces here, won’t the main battlefield be
neglected?"  
  
Tsubaki-san said curiously. Indeed, there must be a good reason to
invade from such a remote area. Moreover, the Laptalica forces had to
use the sea route to get here.  
  
"I have a pretty good idea. If they manage to gain control of Dairode
and Iru, they can then pass through the Iru Mines and reach the royal
capital... in other words, it's a relatively straightforward route to
the heart of the enemy."  
"The problem was that Laptalica didn't have a revival point here, but
that's been solved by securing Sealink."  
  
There's a port near the capital, but it's heavily defended because it's
close to the capital. Also, even if it's a bit of a detour, attacking
from a direction where the enemy least expects it will catch them off
guard.  
  
"Even if they don't attack the capital, seizing Iru will be very
profitable for them. That area is full of ore veins."  
"In fact, I think that's their main target..."  
  
It's a common story for a country to invade its neighbor because of
resources.  
  
"Actually, isn't Sealink more important than I thought?"  
"It can't be helped. The Swaro lords probably never thought Laptalica
would come this way. Until recently, the sea route was unusable due to
the monsters and thieves. They must be in an uproar right now. Besides,
Sealink was protected by a trustworthy Earl's family... but his son
ended up... well, you know."  
  
John-san sighed wearily, shrugging his shoulders, and taking a sip of
tea.  
  
"If I recall correctly, Garadora-sama took the initiative in ensuring
the safety of the sea route."  
"I heard rumors about that too, so I didn’t consider the betrayal
possible, but he might have just been paving the way for Laptalica to
easily invade."  
  
If the sea route hadn't been secured, the Laptalica army wouldn't have
come. The monsters were a threat, but they also acted as a natural
barrier.  
  
"Garadora's betrayal is heavy..."  
"Well, yeah. But he probably betrayed them without much thought."  
"Why do you think that, John-san?"  
"Because Garadora seems like a player. If I were in the same position,
I'd do it. It'd be more fun that way, wouldn't it?"  
  
John-san smirked. That grin doesn't suit a beautiful woman.  
However, Garadora is a player...? But that's possible.  
The son of an Earl family who had gained the trust of the royal family
and suddenly betrayed them... there must be a significant reason, but
maybe not.  
  
"Isn’t that the case with you, Ninja-chan? That's why you waited until
the last minute to contact us, right?"  
"Wha—! T-That's not true!!"  
  
Tsubaki-san jumped in surprise at John-san's words.  
  
"...Really?"  
  
I directed a suspicious, heavy, Niru-like gaze at Tsubaki-san.  
  
"T-that's really what happened~! I definitely wasn't thinking something
like, 'Maybe I could be active if a war breaks out'~!"  
  
…I think I might have glimpsed one of the reasons why war never
disappears entirely. At least in this world.  
Well, I can't deny that I was a little excited when I heard about the
war. If this were a real war, I wouldn't wish for it.  
  
"And… that’s the message. —Hmm, it seems that the Laptalica army is
really there. I’m hearing that there are up to 1000 troops stationed in
Sealink."  
"If 1000 people had flowed into Sealink before the war, surely someone
would have noticed..."  
"With the sea route to Sealink secured recently, the flow of people and
ships between the capital and Sealink has increased. It wouldn't be
noticeable even if merchants smuggled in soldiers and weapons. Besides,
if the lord's son is lending a hand, I think it's perfectly possible."  
  
When I visited the Sealink market before, I felt that there were indeed
many people. Thinking about it, even if I was told that soldiers were
mixed in, I wouldn't have noticed.  
  
"How should I put it... that's quite a thorough preparation."  
"I don't know who came up with the idea, but it's certainly
well-planned. But... it's hard to believe that 1000 troops were actually
on the move... As Witch-chan said, someone would have noticed somewhere,
so it’s odd that no one did. This is a world where players might be
mixed in with NPCs. It's as if the Laptalica army suddenly appeared out
of nowhere."  
  
You can't stop people from talking. If a loose-lipped player were
involved, they would post it online. That alone would leak information
and ruin everything.  
If they were NPCs, there would be no worries. The NPC army could move
without any problems, faithfully following the setting.  
However, this is a VRMMO where role-players are mixed in with NPCs. Is
it possible to instruct only NPCs and keep it hidden from players?  
  
*‘—Then don’t you think it's possible with this world's system (Word
Link System)?’*  
  
Ah... no way. Are you saying that the Laptalica army really just
appeared out of nowhere?  
  
"Fufufu...hahahaha!!"  
"Chloe, what's wrong?"  
"No, it's just... I didn't expect it to actually happen."  
  
The situation necessitates the presence of 1,000 Laptalica troops in
Sealink. Yes, that's the situation.  
If the system filled in the gaps in that situational setting, a pure
100% NPC army would suddenly appear.  
It's like when enemy forces suddenly appear in a strategy game.  
  
Is this a bluff? Is he bluffing? If so, he's a terrible liar.  
But the system took that lie seriously and made it real.  
  
Well, we don't know exactly what method they used to summon them, but
the fact remains that 1000 Laptalica soldiers are right on our doorstep.
This is an undeniable reality.  
  
"Well, it seems like it's about time... I'll fight too."  
  
I pressed the button to join the Swaro Kingdom army.  
John-san did so as a matter of course, and Kyle-san and Tsubaki-san also
joined the Swaro Kingdom army, and were listed as allies.  
  
"By the way... what's the current state of our forces?"  
"Let me tell you using my lord's authority. As the lord, Ange can only
mobilize about 500 troops!"  
"Only 500!? W-Wait, there are 1000 enemies, why are there so few of
us!?"  
  
Tsubaki-san was surprised.  
The main battlefield is in the south, and no one expected Dairode to
become a battlefront, so there was no way the Swaro Kingdom would have
sent forces here in advance.  
  
"I was prepared for such a possibility, you know? That's why there are
even this many. I even stocked up on recovery potions and supplies."  
"Ah, that's why you bought recovery potions from me. ...John-san, you
seem rather experienced at this, don't you?"  
  
Despite saying it was his first war, he had made various preparations
and remained calm even in this desperate situation. Normally, it’d be no
surprise if he panicked.  
  
"Is that so? Maybe it's because I used to be a Magic War player."  
"You played that game?"  
"I didn't do anything noteworthy, though."  
  
Magic War... I remember seeing the name on the bulletin boards before.  
It was one of the popular VRMMO war games, now shut down. The reason for
its closure was the loss of players due to continued operational
issues.  
The Magic War development team is now working for NR Corporation, so it
was rumored that the SSO war system was developed by this team.  
  
"I thought I could experience the war from that game again, but I was
disappointed that the main war zone was in the south. I'm glad I
encountered this opportunity. I'm glad I took my lordly duties
seriously..."  
"Oh? So you're going to the front lines?"  
"Huh? There's no way I'd go to the front lines where my angel might die,
Caroline."  
"Not only is there no trace of its original form left, but I’ve even got
a different gender!"  
  
John-san laughed off Kyle-san's comment.  
Well, judging from the previous conversation, Ange-san, the lord, is a
target. She shouldn't go to the front lines carelessly.  
If Ange-san falls into the enemy's hands, the rights to the Star Stele
will be taken away, and Dairode will fall as well.  
  
"So, do your best to protect my Ange with all your might."  
"I'm not feeling very motivated..."  
"I guess it can’t be helped... —Knight Kyle. For the sake of the Swaro
Kingdom. For the sake of the people of Dairode. Protect me."  
  
Then, John-san's atmosphere changed dramatically.  
The aura around him transformed from a frivolous man to that of a gentle
lady.  
  
"Of course, Ange-sama. As a knight, I shall protect you."  
  
Kyle-san, as well, instantly transformed from an old man into a
refreshing young knight, and responded with a knightly salute.  
  
"...Amazing... To switch like that in an instant..."  
  
Tsubaki-san exclaimed in admiration. It's certainly amazing.  
It's amazing how as soon as he flipped the acting switch, he was able to
carry out this exchange so naturally.  
They don't look like the two men who had been having a pointless
argument just before.  
And he can actually say Kyle-san's name properly...  
  
"Damn it... Damn it... It still doesn't feel right...!"  
"Hahaha! Curse that character's fate!! But it’s a good role. You can do
this kind of thing, huh?"  
"Why is your female role so perfect...?"  
"Fufu... It's the power of love, you know?"  
  
John-san, with Ange-san's appearance, crossed his arms and declared
confidently.  
Is this what happens when you have an overwhelming love for your
character?  
  
"But what are we going to do? We have 500 soldiers against 1000 enemy
troops?"  
  
Tsubaki-san said anxiously. The disparity in forces is too great.  
  
"―I got a message from Swaro. They say they’ll be sending us
reinforcements. So, we just need to hold out until then... but they said
it would take at least three hours."  
"Reinforcements are good news, but three hours...? If we die too much,
the Stele's power will be depleted. To protect this place, we need to
minimize casualties and endure until the reinforcements arrive... but
isn't that difficult?"  
"Well, if we go for a siege defense, I think it might be doable... but
I'm not sure..."  
  
John-san nodded solemnly at Kyle-san's words. It's a very
disadvantageous situation.  
  
"If we could defeat the enemy first... that would be easy... I should
have prepared a spell for that..."  
"I have a spell for such occasions."  
"Eh?"  
  
The three of them turned to me. The situation is certainly dire.  
But that doesn't mean all is lost. There's something we can do.  
  
"We just need to defeat a lot of enemies first, right? Then I'll blow
them all away at once."  
  
I sent a reassuring, dark smile to the three who had turned towards
me.
