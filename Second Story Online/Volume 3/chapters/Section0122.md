# 122・Dairode Front

"Our target is Dairode! Laptalica Kingdom army, advance without fear!"  
"OOO!!"  
  
Under the blue sky, a large army was advancing across the grass plains
from the Sealink direction towards Dairode Town. The soldiers were clad
in matching purple armor, bearing the flag of the Laptalica Kingdom.  
  
"This is quite a sight, isn't it?"  
  
I was observing this scene from above. Or rather, it's Niru's view. Niru
is currently flying near the airspace above Dairode Town. I can see this
scene thanks to the familiar's skill, \[Shared Vision\].  
  
"Enemy soldiers confirmed. About five minutes to Dairode."  
'Understood, Chloe. But are you really sure about this? It's not that I
don't trust you…'  
  
Kyle-san's doubtful voice could be heard from the other end of the
comms.  
  
"You'll see soon enough. Just watch. I'll blow away those worries of
yours, along with the enemy."  
  
The Swaro Kingdom army was situated within Dairode Town... in other
words, we were going to engage in a siege defense. Closing the four
gates of Dairode to prevent enemy entry, while stalling to prevent them
from reaching Iru.  
In response, the Laptalica Kingdom army seems to have decided to lay
siege to Dairode. They divided their troops to encircle Dairode's walls,
surrounding the town.  
  
"As I feared, war with Laptalica… I never thought Dairode Town would be
caught in the crossfire."  
  
Lucille-san has her cat ears perked up and a tense expression on her
face.  
Lucille-san is a familiar, so she can share Niru's vision. That's why
she can see the view of outside the town.  
She probably never imagined her home town would be caught in a war.  
  
"Human entertainment can sometimes be quite barbaric, wouldn't you
say?"  
"…Hm? Did you say something?"  
"A-hem… No, nothing."  
  
It's impossible to say that this war stemmed simply from a human desire
to have fun.  
  
"Now then… shall we begin? Are the preparations done? Lucille-san,
you'll provide support. Earl, please make sure I don't die."  
"Understood, leave it to me. Do your best."  
  
Earl nodded rapidly as if to back up Lucille-san.  
Holding the staff Earl made, I began to chant. A magic circle appeared
at my feet, shining brightly.  
  
"Let's start with the east gate."  
"Understood. ―O 《Portal Gate》… Open!"  
  
My newly acquired \[Spatial Magic\] spell, \[Portal Gate\]. This allows
me to open a dimensional gate about the size of a door. It creates one
gate in front of the caster, and another at a location within sight,
allowing travel between them.  
It's a somewhat limited warp magic. The door connecting the shop in
Dairode Town to the Twilight Forest's log house is apparently an
application of this magic.  
  
One gate appeared before me. And the corresponding gate was placed in
the air above Dairode's East Gate. Sharing visual information with Niru
allows me to set up gates even in distant locations.  
  
Now then, let's launch a surprise attack from the air. Oh, of course,
I'm not going myself.  
Only the magic will go.  
  
"《Dark Burst》… blow away the enemy!"  
  
Concentrating my magical power, finishing the incantation, I released
the power held within my staff towards the gate.  
A mass of darkness passed through the dimensional gate and appeared in
the distant Dairode sky.  
  
And then—as soon as it hit the ground, it caused a huge explosion,
picking up dozens of Laptalica soldiers. The soldiers who took a direct
hit fell down clumsily, like pins knocked down by a bowling ball.  
  
"W-what!?"  
"Waaaaaaaah!?"  
  
From the dimensional gate through which the magic had passed, the
shockwave of the explosion, the screams of the soldiers, and their death
cries came through.  
  
"It seems about 30 people died."  
"What a shame, I thought I could kill about 50 since they were clustered
in front of the gate."  
  
It seems it was far from a strike.  
  
*'Chloe… what did you just do? The enemy soldiers at the East Gate were
blown away.'*  
"What do you mean? I fired a Dark Burst."  
*'Was that really a Dark Burst…?'*  
"You watch it often, Kyle-san, so you know it right? My Dark Burst."  
*'—Your Dark Burst is ridiculously powerful!!'*  
  
Kyle-san shouted, forgetting his role-play. Thank you for the
compliment.  
Even though I'm fighting while putting my life on the line, you know. If
I don't get praised, it’ll be a waste of nearly dying.  
I applied 13 status ailments with the \[All-Purpose Poison\], and
activated the \[Dark Magic\] skill, \[Dark Compensation\], to increase
my firepower.  
This time, I also used the \[Black Mark\] to increase my attack power in
exchange for my defense.  
Because of this, my health decreased rapidly. The moment I cast the
spell, I'm practically on the verge of death.  
To prevent this from happening, Earl threw an \[All-Purpose Potion\] at
me right before I died.  
Furthermore, this time, another effect that boosts firepower was
added.  
The only one who could withstand this Dark Burst directly would probably
be a monster-class being like Willamedes.  
  
*'Ahahahaha! That's amazing, Witch-chan! Keep it up!'*  
  
John-san said so with a high-pitched, beautiful female laugh.  
  
*"Yes, of course. Now, let's go for the second shot!"*  
*'Eh?'*  
  
It can't end here, can it, Kyle-san?  
Since the cooldown for Dark Burst is over, it goes without saying that
I’ll shoot it again, right?  
I can fire roughly every 30 seconds.  
I still have a lot of potions and medicines left, you know. Let's fire
away.  
  
*'Hey, Chloe. We're at war, right?'*  
"That should be the case."  
*'Then… how come all the enemy soldiers have been wiped out in less than
20 minutes!'*  
  
After about 20 minutes of raining Dark Bursts on the enemy army, the
area around Dairode Town was in hellish condition.  
Mountains of soldiers' corpses were piled up. All of them were Laptalica
soldiers in purple armor.  
  
The cooldown for \[Dark Burst\] is 30 seconds. One attack eliminates
about 30 people.  
That means 60 people per minute. 600 people in ten minutes. Over 1000 in
twenty minutes.  
The Laptalica army is approximately 1000 people, so I could annihilate
that army in less than twenty minutes. Correction, I did just now.  
Well, this is because the Laptalica army was divided into four groups to
surround the four gates, so there were only about 250 people per gate.
On the other hand, the Swaro army has about 120 people per gate.  
There was a difference in numbers, but since it was a battle across
gates, the disadvantage due to the difference in numbers wasn't
particularly noticeable, so the defense was successful.  
Thanks to that, I was able to wipe out the Laptalica army, who were
clustered in front of the narrow gates, with aerial bombing using \[Dark
Burst\] from above via a \[Portal Gate\].  
It's also thanks to having asked John-san and Kyle-san beforehand to
keep the enemies clustered together as much as possible.  
  
Plus, now we know that most of the enemy forces are NPCs.  
NPCs aren't stronger than players. Unless the Laptalica soldiers are set
to be exceptionally strong, they would be set as ordinary soldiers.  
According to John-san, the average level of our Swaro soldiers is around
20, so they’re probably around that level.  
In reality, there were a few people who seemed to be players on the
other side, and they were able to dodge or somehow endure my attacks
using their skills.  
If the enemy army had been all players, it wouldn't have gone so well.  
  
*'But where are you shooting from?'*  
"That's a secret."  
  
Behind the dimensional gate connected to the sky above Dairode is a
familiar forest landscape.  
The gentle breeze is creating ripples on the surface of the lake.  
It's so quiet and peaceful that you wouldn't think a battle was taking
place nearby.  
  
This time, to further increase the power of my magic, I chose a
particular location as my firing position.  
—East of Dairode, the \[Twilight Forest\], also known as the Forest of
the Dead.  
  
"Using the power of the Guardian like this…"  
"Come now. That army might invade this forest as well. If so, we have to
defeat them. Besides, Lucille-san, you want to protect Dairode Town too,
don’t you?"  
"Well, that's true…"  
  
Lucille-san seems a little unconvinced. That's right, I'm even more
enhanced than before, thanks to the power of the Guardian of the Seal.  
This Guardian's power only activates within the Twilight Forest. But by
using the dimensional gate, I can activate the Guardian's power and fire
magic from a long distance.  
  
"More importantly… it's not over yet."  
  
Just because we annihilated the enemy doesn't mean it's over. Because
they'll be resurrected.  
A purple army is approaching again from the Sealink direction.  
They must have been resurrected from the Star Stele in Sealink. Unless
we weaken the power of that town's stele, they'll keep coming.  
  
And I don't think the same tactic will work twice… the enemy must have
anticipated this.  
  
Siege defense versus siege attack. Siege attacks are more difficult.  
It's hard to break into a well-fortified defense.  
As John-san said, it might have been possible even without my magic
power.  
Moreover, in this case, if they take too long, the Swaro Kingdom's
reinforcements will arrive. So the enemy will aim to settle things as
quickly as possible.  
Putting aside my magic power, I don't think they would launch a
difficult siege attack without any strategy.  
  
*'W-what!?*  
*'Kyaaaaaaaaa!'*  
  
Screams echoed from within the walls of Dairode Town.  
Looking down at the town from above, people running away and red-hooded
figures rampaging could be seen everywhere.  
  
"...See? I thought so. I knew it would come to this."  
  
The same sight I had once seen in Iru before is now unfolding in
Dairode.
