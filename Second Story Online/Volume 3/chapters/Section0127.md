# 127・Young People and Being Inhuman (Intentional)

Don't give me that 'What the hell are you saying?' look.  
Seriously, that level of superhuman is common in tons of other games.  
Some of the people with fast reaction times have another reason...
they’re veterans, or rather, players of Psychic Sonic, a speed-focused
superhuman game.  
Even in speed-focused games, there are strong players.  
The deciding factor is, of course, player skill.  
  
*'If the opponent is a monster, then you just need to move at superhuman
levels too. Then do something that will throw them off.'*  
*‘I mean, I do understand the logic, but it's impossible to expect me to
act like that!?'*  
*'That's why I'll support you. From what I’ve seen, Light-kun, your
movement isn't bad. You should be able to follow my instructions. Just
move as I say, and you'll be fine.'*  
*'Move according to Chloe's instructions…?'*  
*'Yes. Well, it's a bit of a cheat, though.'*  
  
I was watching Mietia swinging her sword at Kyle-san.  
...Yeah, if she moves like that, we can do this.  
  
*'Hey... am I really doing this? Isn't Tsubaki better?'*  
*'Do you expect her to help you retrieve your sword as the one who stole
it?'*  
*'No... Well, I'd like to get it back, but... facing her is scary...'*  
*'It'll be fine. Even if you fail, you'll revive, and you'll just get
blown away a bit.'*  
*'Easy for you to say! What would you do if you were told to do it?'*  
*'Of course, I wouldn't.'*  
  
I'll answer you clearly. There's no way I would do such a thing.  
There’s no way I could face someone wielding a weapon with such
extraordinary movements.  
  
*'You...! You're making someone else do what you can't…!'*  
*'Yes, that's why I won't do it. I'd find another way then.'*  
*'If you have another way, say it!'*  
*'Weren't you listening? If it were me, I'd find another way. If you're
going to imitate me, you should find another way, right?'*  
  
Like in this situation, for example.  
Like goading Light-kun to deal with Mietia.  
  
*'I have to find another way... damn it.'*  
  
Light-kun is groaning and thinking, but it doesn't look like an
alternative will come up.  
  
*‘If you absolutely won’t do it, I'll ask Tsubaki-san… but Light-kun has
a higher success rate.'*  
*'Eh...? Why?'*  
*'Hey! Hurry up! I'm almost at my limit!!'*  
  
We don't have time for chit-chat. Kyle-san seems to be reaching his
limit.  
He was blocking Mietia's attacks using his shield and skills, but she
must have figured out the skill cooldown timing.  
She attacked when his skills were unavailable.  
But Kyle-san was able to avoid it thanks to his superior player
experience  
However, it doesn't look like he can do it again. Kyle-san must have
realized that, which is why he told us he had reached his limit.  
  
"Ugh, fine! I can't help it! So what am I supposed to do?!"  
  
Light-kun shouted after cutting the communication.  
Niru picked up the sound, so it's fine even if he said it on the spot.  
I’m glad that he's finally motivated.  
So, I'll support you with all my might.  
  
"...You're my opponent this time?"  
  
Light-kun leapt in front of Mietia, taking Kyle-san's place.  
A head-on kamikaze attack. She seemed a little surprised.  
Light-kun swung his sword.  
It's a common sword, the kind you see everywhere.  
In terms of both performance and appearance, the difference between the
two swords is like heaven and earth.  
There's no need to defend against an attack from such a sword.  
Mietia is protected by her shield, so she won't be hurt.  
  
*'A diagonal slash from the left. Shift your body to the right to
dodge.'*  
  
Mietia just stood there and launched an attack at Light-kun, but it was
dodged.  
  
*'Now a horizontal slash. Crouch.'*  
  
A horizontal slash followed Light-kun's near miss, but he dodged it by
crouching.  
  
*'A downward slash from above. Backstep to avoid it.'*  
  
Light-kun, who had crouched, was chased by the silver sword falling from
above, but he quickly stepped back and avoided it.  
  
"Amazing. How are you able to predict attacks in advance?"  
*'The movements are fast, but the attack motions themselves are
monotonous. Next, a straight thrust from the front. Sidestep to the
left.'*  
  
Although he was surprised, Light-kun followed my instructions and
avoided the thrust attack.  
From the side, it looks like he's dodging extremely fast attacks at an
equally lightning fast speed.  
At a speed that seems impossible for a human to move.  
  
Although her attacks are fast, Mietia's attacks are monotonous enough to
be understood after just a little observation.  
She only has a few attack patterns.  
It’s like those characters in old games that only do the same attack
motion when you press the attack button.  
That's why both Tsubaki-san and Kyle-san were able to handle her.  
Well, the attack motion is incredibly fast, so if you don't see the
first attack, it's all over.  
The reason why both of them could deal with her even when they couldn't
see her movements is due to their high level of player skill.  
After seeing her movements, both were easily able to avoid her
attacks.  
Well, Kyle-san lacked the speed to dodge, so he seemed to be trying to
nullify the attacks with defense or invulnerability skills.  
It’s only possible because she uses the same attacks without the
slightest deviation.  
  
Mietia is a beginner. It's even her first game.  
There's no way a child who's only held a sword for less than a month
could suddenly become so skilled.  
She's really just swinging the sword around.  
The fact that she has the Hero's Sword, with its official cheat-level
power, just made her a little harder to beat.  
  
"But what good is just dodging!?"  
*'Ah, sorry. I hadn't thought about what comes next.'*  
"Huh!?"  
  
Light-kun replied in surprise. Thank you for the expected reaction.  
Certainly, he can dodge, but he has no means of attacking.  
The opponent is still protected by a strong shield.  
Even if we were to try and break that barrier, Light-kun's sword won’t
be able to do it.  
  
And he can't keep dodging forever.  
――Because learning the movements applies to the opponent, too.  
  
"...!? Hey, that attack just now was almost a hit!?"  
*'It's only natural, since she's gradually learning our movements.'*  
  
If you dodge the same attack in the same way repeatedly, you'll learn
the dodge pattern.  
That's how Tsubaki-san got hit. Because her evasion pattern was read.  
Kyle-san probably realized it halfway through.  
She had started to anticipate his movements. Even if Mietia's movements
are monotonous, if you can predict the opponent’s actions, you can land
your attacks.  
Just like we've been avoiding her attacks.  
She's probably better at this sort of thing than the average person.  
That kind of data mining is right up her alley.  
  
*'The next attack, you probably won't be able to dodge it. She's
completely read our movements.'*  
"Are you giving up?! I'm going to die!"  
*'If you don't want to die, you should think a little.'*  
  
Now, her attack is coming.  
I would twist my body slightly to the right to avoid the swung
greatsword, but…  
  
"Damn it! Listening to your orders was a mistake!"  
  
Light-kun somehow avoided the greatsword attack by jumping.  
Yes, he avoided the attack that I said was unavoidable.  
  
"Give me back my sword!!"  
"Wh-What!?"  
  
Then, he grabbed the blade of the greatsword, as if pouncing on it. His
movements were like those of a wild monkey.  
This behavior seemed unexpected, and even Mietia was surprised.  
Considering Light-kun’s patterns up until now, she wouldn't have thought
he'd do something like that.  
Of course. After all, the actions she'd seen until now were Light-kun
moving according to my instructions.  
In other words, Mietia had only memorized my dodge patterns.  
And then, right after she thought she had learned his movements, she was
met with an unexpected action, so she was left confused.  
Because what she had memorized until now was the actions of a third
person, not the person in front of her.  
For her, it was like he had suddenly switched places with someone
else.  
  
However, there were a number of prerequisites that had to be met for
this method to work.  
He needed to be able to keep up with her pace and quickly understand and
act on the instructions I gave him, both of which require fast reaction
times.  
In addition, it needed to be someone whose action patterns she hadn't
figured out yet.  
This is why I said Light-kun had a higher chance of success than
Tsubaki-san earlier.  
Tsubaki-san had already been read, so this trick wouldn’t have worked.  
Besides—.  
  
"I knew you'd come up with something different and unexpected."  
  
I didn't think he'd grab the sword. I was surprised he was able to grab
the sword, which has an attack that wipes out your HP with just a
touch.  
It must have been because he grabbed it right after the attack ended, so
he didn't take any damage  
Conveniently, because he was holding her weapon, Mietia entered a
\[Restrained\] state.  
In this state, she can't activate her skills. To cancel it, she must
either deal with Light-kun, who's holding her sword, or let go of it.  
  
"Ha! You're surprisingly weak!"  
  
As Light-kun says, it seems that he has more strength.  
There’s also a level difference, I guess.  
Since I don't think Mietia is high level, her base stats are probably
lower than Light-kun's.  
  
"...Is this sword yours?"  
"Yeah, it is! That's why I've been telling you to return it—"  
"Understood. Then, I'll return it."  
"He...?"  
  
Casually. Saying that, Mietia let go of the sword.  
Light-kun, who was pulling the sword, fell back as if sitting down
heavily. Taking the greatsword down with him.  
  
"Wh-What are you doing…?"  
"Since he said this sword belonged to him, I simply returned it.
Oswald-sama."  
  
Even Oswald seemed surprised by this action.  
Meanwhile, Mietia tilted her head, wondering what was wrong.  
  
"Was something wrong?"  
"...No, Mietia. You did the right thing."  
"I see, that's good."  
  
Mietia is a newly born homunculus.  
In a sense, she's still a child who doesn't quite understand right from
wrong.  
She also doesn't seem to fully understand the importance of the sword
either.  
That's why she obeyed Light-kun's request to return it.  
  
At that moment, a communication from an allied force came in.  
It seems they've wiped out the red-hooded group that had infiltrated
Dairode Town.  
It looks like Oswald also received the same communication, and his
expression worsened.  
  
"Bad timing…! Fine, let's give up on the sword and go."  
"Wait! I'm not going to let you get away!"  
"Chloe, we’ll chase them, but you…"  
"I'm fine here. Please go after them."  
  
Kyle-san and the others chased after Oswald and Mietia, who were trying
to escape.  
Well, whatever the case… we've neutralized a troublesome opponent.  
There was a way to break that shield, but it became unnecessary.  
Since we've dealt with the rats in the town, this battlefield should be
safe.  
  
"Ahahaha! Now that I think about it, I didn't tell Mietia not to give
the sword away..."  
  
...No, correction. One red rat remains.  
The most troublesome one.  
During the fight with Mietia, I noticed he had slipped away without a
trace.  
  
"I figured you'd be coming right about now, Ignis."  
  
He probably came through the crack that Mietia opened.  
He slowly walked toward me.
