# 123・The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend

In SSO’s wars, the goal is to weaken the power of the \[Star Stele\]. To
do this, you defeat enemy troops, reducing the power of the \[Star
Stele\] as they resurrect, to a certain amount.  
However, the Stele doesn't just resurrect soldiers on the front lines;
it also resurrects civilians who aren't participating in combat.  
Therefore, you can weaken the Stele by killing civilians instead of
soldiers. Moreover, unlike soldiers, there are many non-combatants, so
it’s very easy to defeat them.  
  
"But I never thought they'd actually do it…"  
  
A group of red hooded people appeared in Dairode Town, mercilessly
attacking the residents. Many were killed, and the power of our own
Stele was rapidly decreasing.  
Even though they don't die permanently, it's unpleasant to watch
innocent people being slaughtered. Well, they are an evil organization,
so I guess such inhumane tactics are to be expected.  
  
*'I heard about it, but I didn't expect them to actually show up.'*  
"We've already identified the areas with the most casualties. Please
respond there. We'll also deploy our golems to assist where needed."  
  
Lucille-san gave Ange-san the compiled information on the town's
situation, then used a dimensional gate to deploy golems to the town.
This is where we’ll put the golem drop technique to good use.  
  
*'Understood. But when did they infiltrate…?'*  
"They didn't just sneak in. They were hiding there from the start."  
  
I answered John-san, who was in Ange-san mode.  
—The Crimson Apostles of Chaos.  
They lurk everywhere, bringing Chaos to the world, only appearing in
their blood-soaked red hoods when the opportunity arises.  
They’re connected to the Laptalica army, and if the previous incident
wasn't a bluff… then it was inevitable that they would emerge like
this.  
  
"As casualties increase, more people will gather at the Star Stele. If
people are attacked and re-killed there, the power of the stele will
decrease again."  
*'I know. I've ordered troops to protect the area around the Stele. But
if we defeat the enemy, we can force them out, so let's prioritize
suppression, alright?'*  
"…Yes, that sounds like the best approach."  
  
In war zones, the system mandates joining one side or the other.  
The red-hooded group must be on the Laptalica side. Otherwise, they
wouldn't be able to attack the inhabitants belonging to the Swaro side,
as friendly fire is prevented.  
Once they’re defeated, they’ll respawn at the Sealink Stele, not the
Dairode Stele. Once driven out, they won't reappear in town.  
  
So we want to suppress them quickly, but…  
  
"The Laptalica army is counterattacking… but they're quite dispersed."  
  
Through Niru's eyes, the army, which was a solid purple mass earlier,
was now scattered, looking like a polka dot pattern.  
I expected them to take countermeasures against Dark Burst. However,
when attacking the gate, they'll have to concentrate their forces there,
so we can target that moment.  
The problem is the difference in military strength. We're already
deploying troops to suppress the enemy within the town. If we also have
to defend the gate in this situation, it'll be tough.  
  
"Chloe… the troublesome people in town are causing even more trouble."  
"It's probably that red drug again, right?"  
  
Unpleasant predictions often come true.  
Looking around the town, the red medicine seems to have been scattered
everywhere, causing the civilians to rampage and increasing
casualties.  
Also, some of the red-hooded individuals have also become chaotic. Those
maintaining their sanity are likely using an improved version of the
drug. Inflicted Chaos has an abnormally large stat increase effect.  
Before, even with this power, one would lose their sanity and couldn't
use it effectively, but the improvements have removed that drawback.  
  
The recent series of red drug incidents were probably experiments for
this. There’s no way they wouldn't waste precious material
meaninglessly.  
Fortunately, both effects can be neutralized with holy water. I've
already sold some potions with that power to Ange-san's side, so I think
it should be fine if they use those…  
…The red-hooded group's movements are suspiciously good. Their numbers
aren't that high, but their actions are very skillful, making them
extremely troublesome. It's probably because many of them aren't NPCs,
but players.  
Who would have thought they'd send a small elite group to set up an
ambush here?  
I didn't expect there to be so many players, but they're the type who
would play villains. They seem like the kind of people who wouldn't
carelessly leak information, making them perfect for the role.  
  
I don't have time to admire the enemy's tactics. Besides, there are
still many uncertainties.  
Well, first of all, we need to decide on what to do about the current
situation. Honestly, I can only leave the town's defense to our allies
like Ange-san and Kyle-san.  
We've already taken action regarding manpower, but… if possible, I would
like to have just a few more people.  
  
For now, I'll defeat as many of the enemies outside as I can… and
prevent them from getting inside…  
  
"――Chloe!!"  
  
The moment I was about to cast my next spell, something flew towards me
with a whoosh. It pierced my chest without mercy.  
Looking at my chest, I saw a long rod and arrow feathers protruding. —I
was hit. A sniper shot.  
It's clear where the arrow came from. It’s the portal gate I opened.  
It allows my attacks through, but this time it also let theirs through
as well.  
To make things worse, I'm now so weak that even the slightest touch
would kill me in one hit. That's because I applied over ten status
ailments to unleash a full-power shot, so my defense is below zero. My
armor is practically paper-thin.  
  
My death released Niru and Lucille-san's summons, leaving Earl alone and
flustered near me. Please don’t panic. I'll revive anyway. Right now,
more importantly…  
  
"――Tsubaki-san, do you know who the sniper was just now?"  
*'I've already taken care of them.'*  
"Wow, that was fast. As expected."  
  
Tsubaki-san is currently in the air above the battlefield with Haku. Her
role is to quickly eliminate enemy soldiers who pose a threat. In short,
she's eliminating troublesome players.  
Players are more skilled than NPCs after all. Earlier, they sniped me,
tried to shoot down the flying Niru, and even nullified my magic
itself.  
So I’m having her eliminate those players beforehand.  
  
*'Chloe-dono, are you alright!'*  
"I'm fine. I've already resurrected. I can resume fighting
immediately."  
  
I can set my \[Sealed Star Stone\] as my resurrection point, allowing me
to instantly revive here.  
It doesn't consume the power of the Dairode Stele, so it won't affect
the battle situation.  
  
Having revived, I resummoned Niru and Lucille-san, and we regrouped.  
Niru looks a bit tired. I'll let him eat whatever he wants after this,
so do your best.  
Niru, with a weary sigh, flew into the sky through the dimensional
gate.  
  
*'Chloe-dono… I apologize… If only I had been more careful…'*  
"No, it's my fault for being careless. Don't worry about it."  
*'That won't do!!'*  
  
Your voice was a little loud just now... It sounded desperate and
loud.  
  
*'To have caused the death of a friend who trusted me… I will atone with
my life!'*  
"You don't need to atone. Don't waste your life."  
*'I can’t believe… that you would show mercy to someone like me…'*  
  
No, if you die now, you'll only waste the Stele's power, so please
don't.  
And you've also killed Chloe before.  
But this isn't the right atmosphere to mention that, so I'll keep
quiet.  
  
*'Indeed, Chloe-dono is worthy of being the master I should serve… May I
call you my lord?'*  
"Is a master-servant relationship necessary in a friendship? Well, it's
up to you."  
*'…! I am grateful for this happiness! I will do my best and risk my
life for my lord!'*  
  
Please don't risk your life. Life is precious.  
  
"Even so, you seem quite happy, Tsubaki-san. Ah, this is purely as a
player's observation."  
*'Eh!? How did you know?'*  
  
Rather, who do you think wouldn't understand after all that? Your
happiness is overflowing.  
  
*'Ehehe… I'm so happy to finally meet someone I can call my lord, and to
be able to work as a ninja for them!'*  
  
Come to think of it, I remember she mentioned wanting to be a ninja like
that before. I'm not sure if Chloe is a suitable master, but I’m glad
that she's getting closer to her ideal.  
…Also, I'll keep quiet about the fact that I can see Tsubaki-san rolling
around on Haku's back in joy through Niru's eyes.  
Well, now we know that the chances of Tsubaki-san betraying us are
extremely low.  
  
Just because some uncertainties have been reduced doesn't mean the
situation has improved. Things might get problematic if we continue like
this…  
  
"Oh my, you seem quite troubled."  
"yeah, I'm really in a bind――!?"  
  
I heard a childish voice, and there she was, Lily-chan. Unlike when I
saw her at the shop, she’s in proper little devil attire this time.  
  
"W-Why are you here!?"  
"Because the entrance was open, of course~"  
  
Looking in the direction she was pointing, a wide-open dimensional gate
can be seen. ...It can let magic and enemy arrows through, so even
people can pass through it. It's the correct way to use it though, since
its original purpose is for transportation.  
I let my guard down because I had placed it in the sky, but any player
who can fly could get in. For now, I’ll quickly deactivate the skill and
close the gate.  
  
"Wow! Such a beautiful lake~! The rumors were true~!"  
  
Lily was ecstatic about the lake. A troublesome child has infiltrated…  
Normally, only I as the guardian, along with Lucille-san and Earl, could
enter this place.  
Otherwise, a barrier protects this location, hiding it from view.  
But this time, my gate allowed entry from the inside.  
  
"You… why are you here?"  
"Don't be so wary, Belcy-chan? I'm not interested in seals or Chaos~.
Ah, is that the Sealed Star Stone? It's pretty!"  
"If you're not interested, why did you come here?"  
  
Since she's seen this place, there's no point in hiding that I'm the
guardian, but it’s a different story if she tries to harm the seal.  
  
"I told you, I'm not interested! I'd be in trouble if the seal was
broken too! Anyway, I came here about that deal earlier."  
"Ah, about the cooperation? Honestly, there's no point in cooperating.
And if you want to defeat the red-hooded gang, you can go ahead and do
it yourself. I won't stop you."  
"That's true, but…"  
  
After sighing, she began speaking again, seemingly resigned.  
  
"Lily is a demon… so I'm repelled by this side's \[Star Stele\]. I was
sent back to the demon realm after dying. To be honest, it took a really
long time to get back here."  
"Ah, I see."  
  
Demons can't use the Star Stele. They are resurrected, but they must
return to the Demon Realm. I’ve never seen her die before, or rather,
she usually escapes at the last moment.  
Now I think I understand why she’s been running away. She was trying to
avoid death as much as possible.  
Being repelled by the Star Stele means she can't participate in this war
on either side, so she gets thrown out.  
  
"It's incredibly inconvenient to return. So… could you let me use this
Stele?"  
"This Star Stone is for sealing, so it can't be used for
resurrection."  
"Liar, onee-chan just resurrected earlier! Please~! If I can use it, I
can freely defeat the red hoods without any hesitation~ and it's not a
bad deal for onee-chan either!"  
  
It's true that we need more manpower, so there are advantages, but if
possible, I'd prefer to avoid making a pact with this devil.  
  
"Also, it seems like other demons are cooperating with the Laptalica
army. That faction is opposed to the current Demon King… I don't want
them to gain too much power, so I decided to side with Swaro."  
"…You should have told me that earlier."  
  
That information lowered the barrier slightly. I see, so the demon’s
side also has its own circumstances.  
  
"If it's something you don't need to say, it's best not to say it,
right?"  
  
If the objective isn't clear, it's impossible to know what’ll happen, so
there’s no way we could've worked together.  
  
"In that case, I'll make it usable for you temporarily."  
"Really!? Yay! Thank you, onee-chan!"  
"But only temporarily, for the duration of this war."  
"That's fine!"  
  
I used my guardian authority to register Lily-chan so she could
resurrect from the \[Sealed Star Stone\]. Now, even if she dies, she can
choose this as her resurrection point.  
  
"Chloe, I can’t believe you actually made a contract with a demon."  
"I'll immediately unregister her if anything happens. Besides, it's not
all bad."  
  
The \[Sealed Star Stone\] isn't related to this war. So, even if she
resurrects from here, the town's \[Star Stele\] won't be weakened, and
the outcome won't be affected.  
Moreover, Lily-chan is quite strong. If she can resurrect almost
endlessly, she'll be a powerful ally.  
  
"Now that I think of it, I saw a rabbit in town earlier."  
"Oh really? Good to know… I was just wanting to hunt rabbits."  
"Rabbit hunting is good, but please hunt other things too, okay?"  
"Yes! I understand!"  
  
I opened a dimensional gate above Dairode Town and sent Lily-chan
there.  
I don't trust the demon Lily-chan, but I trust her killing intent, so it
should be fine.
