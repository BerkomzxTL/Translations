# 98・Money Flying Away

“……Earl’s not here?”  
  
Even after looking around the now-familiar log cabin, I couldn't find
that round, massive body. Only Belle, the black cat, was here, napping.
He's usually the one to greet me right after I log in…  
  
"Maybe he went to town."  
  
Lucille-san said this as she possessed Belle immediately after being
summoned.  
  
“That one’s been going outside the forest lately.”  
“Really? But I told him not to go out on his own when I'm not around…”  
  
I opened the map to check his location. Since Earl is my servant, his
position is displayed on the map.  
  
“…He seems to be in town after all. Is this location Miranda-san's
shop?”  
  
If he’s at her place, I can rest easy for now. Let's go pick him up.  
Seriously, going out on your own… It would be dangerous if people found
out he was an Orc.  
  
  
  
“Welcome~! Ah, Chloe-chan!”  
  
I hopped on my broom and arrived at Miranda-san’s shop in a flash.
Inside the shop is Miranda-san, greeting me with a gentle smile, and
Earl, who flinched and shrank at the sight of me.  
  
“Earl, I’ve been looking for you. I told you before not to go out on
your own!”  
  
Earl bowed his head in apology. It’s Earl. I'm sure he understands that.
But, to go out knowing the danger…  
  
“What if something were to happen to you? Don't worry me so much.
…There's no one who can replace you.”  
  
Even now, Earl can be revived with the power of the Star Stele if he
dies. But that's not absolute. If there’s some kind of… special
circumstance leading to death, the effect will be nullified. Judging
from the way the cause of death is verified, that seems to be the case
anyways. Given the nature of this game, if a special circumstance is
created, it seems it would be difficult to overturn it.  
  
“Now, now, Chloe-chan. Please don't be so angry~”  
  
Miranda-san tried to soothe me with a cheerful smile but… I wonder. It's
certainly her usual smile, but today's smile has something… hidden
within it.  
  
“……Are you hiding something?”  
“Eh~, I'm not hiding anything~. More importantly, I got the money from
Iru!”  
  
As if changing the subject, Miranda-san placed a leather bag packed full
of things on the table. …No way.  
  
"The shortfall in the potion costs Chloe-chan used and the potion costs
I was able to gather... it's a total of 1,200,000 gold!"  
“1.2 million gold!? You're kidding!?”  
  
Wait. Why is it such a huge amount of money!?  
  
“See~ this is a potion with the purification power of holy water,
right?”  
  
She took out a potion. It was indeed the potion I sold her, the one made
containing the power of the lake’s water.  
  
“Chloe-chan, do you know the price of holy water?”  
“……No.”  
“Ten thousand. Well, that’s the church price, so it's probably a little
lower in reality. And after I had it appraised, it seems the
purification power is weaker than actual holy water, so I calculated the
amount to be a bit lower~”  
“Even so, this much?”  
“This is the price~”  
  
Miranda-san's smiling face is scary….  
  
“Hey, Chloe-chan. I’ve been wondering this for a while now… what is
this? You made this many potions with the effectiveness of holy water?
Where did you make them?"  
  
Miranda-san leaned over the counter and asked, putting her face close to
mine.  
  
“That…”  
“Is it related to Grandma Lucille who suddenly appeared the other
day?”  
“…………”  
  
I glanced at the black cat at my feet. A message from Lucille-san:
‘Cover it up’. …What should I do? Even a small lie will be seen
through.  
  
"Sorry, sorry. I ended up interrogating you."  
  
Perhaps unable to bear seeing me remain silent, she shrugged her
shoulders, laughed, and returned to her seat.  
  
“It’s fine as long as Grandma Lucille is healthy. I won't ask anything
more. Everyone has things they don’t want to be asked about~. Besides,
you’re an important client, so I want you to continue patronizing me.”  
  
Miranda-san said this with a kind smile… truly, a Miranda-san-like
smile.  
  
“Thank you. Yes, if possible, please don’t ask. I can only say that I
make it through legitimate means.”  
“Yes, yes, there’s no problem if it’s a legitimate product. But, this is
unlikely to sell…”  
“……Why?”  
“I told you before. Holy water isn’t something you’d normally use in
potions. …And with this quantity, the church might say something.”  
  
Ah, that's certainly true. The Star Church distributes holy water. If
someone who isn’t a church member sells potions with the power of holy
water, they're likely to attract attention.  
  
“You too, Chloe-chan, be careful. I managed to fool the guards in Iru
who had been given the potions but…”  
"That must have been a lot of trouble for you."  
  
However… now that the player guardian is known, it looks like the church
will be keeping an eye on us soon.  
  
For now, no players have come to the forest looking for the seal.
Role-players probably won’t come if it’s not relevant to their
character, and there’s no particular benefit for ordinary players
either. Of course, pranksters and the like are an exception...  
  
“By the way, what is this on the counter?”  
  
A golden frog-shaped ornament, which wasn't there before, was sitting on
the counter. It has a gold coin in its mouth.  
  
‘It’s a money frog. In reality, it’s a popular item that brings good
fortune~. With this, this shop and my real-life shop are sure to
prosper~!  
  
I wonder if the in-game item will actually have an effect in reality…  
  
  
  
“Earl, you’ve been going out without my permission, haven’t you?”  
  
Leaving Miranda-san’s shop, I asked Earl as we walked along the road.
With a guilty expression, Earl slowly nodded.  
  
“I don't want you wandering around carelessly. There's also the issue of
the seal in the forest..."  
  
I don't want Earl to go out much because he’s risking his own safety.
And he’s going in and out of town by going through the barrier in the
sealed part of the Forest. It’d be bad if he was seen doing that.  
  
“I also don't want to go in and out of the forest too much, but…”  
"About that, there is one thing you can do."  
  
Lucille-san, who was walking beside me, spoke up.  
  
“My house used to be in this town. Do you remember?”  
"Ah, right, it certainly was."  
  
During the previous Red Beast incident, I first met Lucille-san in that
house. At that time, she had already become the Red Beast, so it wasn't
her true form, but an illusion created by illusion magic.  
  
“That house has a magical entrance that connects dimensions. It’s
connected to the house in the forest.”  
“Eh, really? Why didn't you tell me sooner!?”  
  
Then I can go to town immediately without having to go through the
forest or grasslands.  
  
“Then let's hurry to Lucille-san's house. I’m curious about this
dimensional entrance thing.”  
“Hey! Wait a minute!"  
  
I think Lucille-san's house in town is… this way. Using my \[Local
Knowledge\], I was able to get to Lucille-san's house without getting
lost.  
  
  
  
“……Vacant?”  
  
When we arrived at Lucille-san’s house, there was a white notice on the
door. The writing was in the Swaro Kingdom language. The barely legible
words said the house was vacant.  
  
"Just as I thought..."  
“……What is this? Or rather, an abandoned house… isn’t this Lucille-san’s
house?”  
“Ah, it was. Until a few weeks ago. …If you don't pay taxes to the lord,
this is inevitable.”  
“Tax?”  
“This area is managed by the lord. Since we are allowed to live here,
isn’t it natural that we should pay money?”  
“That's right. So this house is now…”  
“It’s no longer my house.”  
“That’s why you didn’t tell me until now.”  
  
What a shame. I thought it would make traveling back and forth much
easier…  
  
“What are you doing there?”  
  
A soldier from this town called out to us who were in front of
Lucille-san's former house. I think he's one of the lord's private
soldiers?  
  
“Could you be the former owner of this house?”  
"Um... that's not it."  
  
The former owner is at your feet right now.  
  
“I see… If you find her, please bring her to the station. We need to
collect the overdue taxes.”  
“Is that so-”  
“Meow”  
  
Lucille-san, why are you pretending not to know anything and meowing…?  
  
“Um, what should I do if I want to live in this house?”  
“Then go to the city hall. You can do the paperwork there.”  
  
With that, the soldier, who seemed to be on patrol, left.  
  
“Is the dimensional magic still in the house?”  
“Yes, it is. The magic was set up not by me, but by the previous
Guardian.”  
“You left the back door to the forest as it was? What would you have
done if the house had been handed over to someone else…”  
“Only the Guardian and those who have permission can use it. And it's
hidden, so most people shouldn’t be able to find it.”  
  
That's what she says, but it still feels unsettling to leave the back
door as it is.  
  
"I guess I should buy this house after all..."  
“I thought you would say that. The price is probably… around 1,500,000
gold.”  
“……Seriously?”  
  
When I went to the office, that was really the price. …I somehow managed
to reach 1,500,000 gold by combining the 1.2 million I got from
Miranda-san earlier with my remaining money, so I bought it on the
spot.  
  
Ah, I had saved up such a large sum of money... I thought I could use it
to buy new equipment...  
  
  
  
“Wow, it really connects…!”  
  
Lucille-san's house in Dairode Town… no, it's my house now. When I
opened the hidden door there, it led to the familiar log cabin in the
sealed section of the forest.  
  
“Is this magic an application of spatial magic?”  
“It seems so. Well, I think it's probably better to assume that it's
something more advanced than what you're used to."  
  
I guess so. But if my spatial magic level goes up, will I be able to do
this too? Up until now, I've only used it to drop golems...  
  
That’s right. I wanted to check my skills. When I looked at the bulletin
board the other day, there was a discussion about the number of basic
skill slots. My current number of basic skills is 27. The initial limit
is 30 slots. I'm three away from reaching the limit.  
  
To uncap the slot limit… does that mean you need 10 SP per slot!?  
I currently have 18 SP. I only have enough to increase by one slot. I
checked, and it seems that raising the skill level cap also requires 10
SP. None of my skills have reached the level cap of 50 yet, so I don't
have to worry too much. By the way, it seems that skills that reach the
max level can be turned into unique skills.  
  
There were more skills that I could acquire, but I needed to consider…
oh, wait, isn't this a language skill?  
Among the skills that appeared in the skills list were \[Language:
Laptalica Kingdom Language\], \[Language: Dwarven Language - Duo
Regional Dialect\], and \[Language: Old Duo Language\]. The reason so
many languages appeared is probably because of my recent trip to the Iru
Mining Town. Many people gathered there, so the languages spoken were
quite diverse.  
  
These are apparently the main languages spoken in the Duo Region.
\[Language: Laptalica Kingdom Language\] is the language spoken in the
Laptalica Kingdom, a large country next to the Swaro Kingdom and on par
with it in size. So it’s a language often used in this region alongside
the Swaro language.  
  
\[Language: Dwarven Language - Duo Regional Dialect\] is as its name
suggests. \[Language: Old Duo Language\] is described as an ancient
language that is said to be the origin of Swaro Kingdom language and
Laptalica Kingdom language.  
  
And… if I learn all of them, they will be integrated with the
\[Language: Swaro Kingdom Language\] that I currently know, and will
change to \[Language: Duo Regional Language\]. It'll be treated the same
as my unique skill \[Language: Heiss Regional Language\].  
  
I have exactly three slots left… I can get all of them with 3 SP each,
so I have enough SP… If I integrate them, I won’t have any trouble with
the languages of this region in the future.  
  
So, I acquired \[Language: Laptalica Kingdom Language\], \[Language:
Dwarven Language - Duo Regional Dialect\], and \[Language: Old Duo
Language\], paying a total of 9 SP, and they were integrated into
\[Language: Duo Regional Language\]. The level seems to inherit the
level of the Swaro Kingdom language. If I had started at level 1, I
would have been in trouble again.  
  
Oh, that’s right. While researching, I found out that four resistances
can be integrated once you learn them.  
  
I currently have \[Poison Resistance\], \[Paralysis Resistance\], and
\[Sleep Resistance\]. I'm missing one.  
  
And besides――don't you think poison resistance is unnecessary?  
  
Having \[Dark Compensation\], I want at least one status ailment.
Compared to paralysis and sleep, which restrict movement, poison only
reduces your HP. Yes, it only reduces HP.  
  
If that’s all, I don't need this \[Poison Resistance\]. I want to
increase my firepower.  
  
It seems that you can remove skills, but… I have to go to a special NPC
who can do that. For now… Oh, \[Curse Resistance\] and \[Stun
Resistance\] are in the list. They also cost 3 SP each. A total of 6 SP
is needed. If I combine them, I’ll have one slot left… let’s get them.  
  
I picked up \[Curse Resistance\] and \[Stun Resistance\]. Combining them
with \[Paralysis Resistance\] and \[Sleep Resistance\] resulted in
\[Resistance (Paralysis : Sleep : Curse : Stun)\]. The levels carried
over as well.  
  
That should be it for now. I took a breath and looked around the house.
Earl is still carving wood and making something. Niru is sleeping on his
perch. He looks annoyed at the glass skull next to him.  
  
Lucille-san seems to have returned Belle’s body to her, and Belle is
sleeping soundly. …At some point, a basket bed with a fluffy cushion
popped up, and she was sleeping in there. Earl must have made it.  
  
It feels like peace has finally come since the last incident, but there
are still many problems to be solved.  
  
“I can't let my guard down.”  
  
But, I don't mind this tension. Perhaps the reason I can enjoy the sense
of crisis that I can't experience in reality is because I can relax
knowing that this is a game.  
  
――Beep!  
  
A message? Who could it be? Ah, it’s my friend. What’s this…?  
  
――I was selected for the third group!  
  
Great! My friend seems to have won the lottery. Now we can play the game
together.  
The start of the third season is coming soon. …Wait, that means?  
  
"...Are the beginners for the third batch coming to town?"  
  
This is Dairode Town. Among the many initial starting points, this is
one of the recommended starting towns for beginners along with the towns
in the Ente Kingdom.  
When I first started, a considerable number of people chose this place,
and it was very lively. And after they level up, they'll go through the
Twilight Forest to head to the Capital…  
  
…I feel like I have a few more things to worry about now.  
  
While feeling anxious about the future, and looking forward to my
friend's visit, I decided to make some herbal tea.
