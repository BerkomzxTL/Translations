# 102・Let’s Form a Party

We quickly arrived at the Iru Mining Town.  
  
Before coming here, I was scolded by Lucille-san.  
Of course, I haven't forgotten my role as a guardian. Not at all… but
both Lucille-san and I have felt for a while now that I need appropriate
strength for the role.  
  
This is necessary for me to be a suitable guardian, and Lucille-san
didn't seem seriously opposed to it.  
I left Earl in charge while I'm away. It's better than having nobody
there at all, and it's probably like this whenever I'm logged out. I'll
jump back (die) if anything happens.  
  
"It's a lot nicer than it was before."  
"Mhm, and the residents look happier."  
  
From a vantage point overlooking the town after passing through the
cave, it's changed from the first time I saw it. The scars from
Willamedes' rampage were still visible. I could clearly see houses that
had been crushed by the demonic beast.  
  
The town is in the midst of reconstruction. However, the expressions of
the residents going about their business aren't that gloomy. Apparently,
the Prince of the Swaro Kingdom is leading the reconstruction efforts,
and many player craftsmen and volunteers have come to help rebuild, so
things are progressing quite quickly.  
  
And the best part is the discovery of a new dungeon. Some players are
gathering just for that, and despite the reconstruction, Iru is bustling
with activity.  
  
Swept along by the significantly increased flow of people compared to my
last visit, I reached the center of town- the entrance to the
underground mine. The entrance is a large, gaping hole, and it continues
in the same way beyond. It was from here that Willamedes emerged from
underground, so it was only natural that a hole of this size would be
formed.  
  
Many people crowded in front of the large hole. I can see some miners
with pickaxes, but the overwhelming majority are armed. They're
obviously players who have come to challenge the dungeon.  
  
"Our party is recruiting two more healers!"  
"Recruiting frontliners! We need a mage and a healer!"  
"I can use thief skills, so someone please pick me up!"  
  
This seems to have also become a temporary party recruitment area, with
recruitment calls coming from everywhere. Apparently, the Iru dungeon
can be tackled by up to eight people, and the more people there are, the
stronger the enemies become, but the experience points and drops also
improve.  
  
In that case, I think it would be best if I joined a party. While it’s
possible to challenge it solo, the dungeon is really adjusted for
multiple players. It's quite difficult to challenge alone, especially as
a mage who needs to cast spells. Ah, I mean witch.  
  
"That pointy thing looks awfully familiar…"  
  
…Who's pointy? Well, I do always wear a pointy witch's hat!  
  
"Oh, there's someone here who looks very familiar. It's good to see you
haven't changed at all, Light-kun."  
"I haven't stayed completely the same. Look closely, my equipment is
new."  
  
Turning towards the voice, there was Light-kun with a sullen expression.
His equipment has certainly changed, but he himself doesn't seem to have
changed much. Neither has the person next to him.  
  
"It doesn't seem like that's what you were saying... but maybe it's best
not to say anything."  
"It's been a while, Kyle-san. You seem to be the same as always…"  
"It's good to see you too, Chloe."  
  
Kyle-san is smiling and returning the greeting with a slightly
embarrassed look on his face.  
It seems that the two of them had heard about the dungeon just like me.
They had already traveled back to the royal capital and heard the rumors
there.  
  
"It seems I’m not yet strong enough to take the Royal Knight Order
entrance exam. I thought I'd hone my skills here."  
  
Come to think of it, Kyle-san did want to become a knight like his
father.  
  
"But there were no clues about the sword."  
  
Light-kun followed up with a shrug. They haven't found Tsubaki-san, who
might know the whereabouts of the sword. On the other hand, they’ve been
running into Red Hoods recently, but it seems that they are either
low-ranking members or weirdos who make up random names and cause
trouble, and they can't find any useful information to work off of.  
  
"After making such a fuss here before, now there's no sign of them.
Chloe, don't you know anything? Anything at all will do."  
"I don't know anything."  
  
Actually, it seems a real-life friend of mine is with Ignis and the
others. I supposedly met and talked with them the other day. But that's
irrelevant to this matter. Besides, Chloe (the character) couldn't
possibly know anything about that, so there's nothing to talk about.  
  
"…Really?"  
"It’s true. I don't know anything. I'd like to be the one asking for
information. I also want to take them down."  
"Okay, okay, stop glaring at me with that scary face."  
  
I'm irritated, like I've remembered something I'd rather forget, and I'm
pretending to act like I don't know. I really want to crush them
immediately once I find them.  
  
"So, Chloe, you came to challenge this dungeon too. Why don't you come
with us?"  
"I was thinking of teaming up with someone, so this is perfect."  
"Then we need five more. With this lineup, we’ll definitely need a scout
and a healer."  
  
The scout's role includes discovering enemies, finding and disarming
traps, and unlocking doors. Basically, a thief. A healer goes without
saying.  
Kyle-san is already our shield, and we have Light-kun and me as front
and back line attackers, so there shouldn't be any problems.  
  
"In a worst-case scenario, I can act as a healer, but… it’s not my
specialty so don't expect too much."  
  
Kyle-san can use healing magic, but the healing amount is inferior to
that of a specialist. It might be fine as a sub-healer, but not as the
main healer. Besides, he's also the shield.  
  
With those conditions, we also started recruiting members… but nobody's
coming. Especially healers; everyone's looking for them. They're in high
demand.  
  
"Saval, over here! That group's recruiting conditions look good! Wait,
is that…?"  
"Azi, don't pull me! —Wait, is that from last time…?"  
  
A girl with cat ears and a young elf man rushed towards us from the
crowd. They must have heard Kyle-san's voice. They didn't expect it to
be us, and they both had surprised expressions.  
  
"My, my. If it isn't Saval-kun and Azi-chan."  
"U-um, hello, Chloe-san."  
  
...When our eyes met, Azi-chan hid behind Saval-kun. Are you still
scared of me?  
  
"You two, wait up! Don't leave us behind!"  
"It's way more crowded than usual!"  
  
After them, two young dwarves appeared, chasing after the two of them.
The dwarf priest with a crosier is Bluey-kun, and the one with a
craftsman's attire and a pickaxe on his back is Oliver-kun.  
  
"Bluey-kun and Oliver-kun… It's unusual to see you two together."  
"There are a number of reasons for this."  
  
Saval-kun explained with a wry smile. Apparently, since they had stolen
from Oliver-kun last time, they decided to help him with his request as
atonement.  
  
"You really aren't suited to be thieves…"  
"Ehehe… well it's true that we were a well-known group of thieves."  
"No, we weren't that well-known."  
"W-what? Really?"  
"We kept failing, didn't we?"  
  
Seeing Saval-kun nod at Bluey-kun's words, Azi-chan became dejected but
started talking again while hiding behind Saval-kun.  
  
"…W-we were a somewhat famous thief guild to those in the know, but
we've already quit the thieving business! From now on, we’re starting a
new initiative to help those in need as righteous thieves!"  
"So we're doing this to clear up our rather numerous criminal
records."  
  
Apparently, that activity involved tackling the dungeon. Oliver-kun
wanted to go to the dungeon as a craftsman.  
  
"But, there aren't many parties that take specialized craftsmen. I was
in a tight spot when these guys showed up, so it was perfect."  
  
Dungeon-produced ore seems to be circulating in the market, but as
Oliver-kun’s motto is to source locally rather than buy it, he wanted to
go and mine the ore himself this time as well, because he feels he can
make better things that way.  
  
"You seem to be looking for a scout and a healer. How about teaming up
with us? Azi and Saval can be scouts. Leave the healing to me."  
"But would it be okay if Oliver-kun comes too as a craftsman?"  
"Honestly, you can think of me as a non-combatant. I'm not good at
fighting."  
  
Kyle-san glanced at me and Light-kun. We nodded to indicate we didn't
mind.  
  
"Of course it's okay. We'll be counting on you from now on."  
"Yeah, thanks. We really appreciate this. We've been turned down by
other parties over and over."  
  
Saval-kun seemed relieved by Kyle-san's reply. It’s true that it'd be
difficult to find a party focused on clearing the dungeon willing to
include Oliver-kun as a non-combatant.  
  
"That makes seven. The maximum is eight, but…"  
"This is fine, isn't it? We have all the necessary jobs… hmm?"  
  
I can feel someone looking at me. Or rather, Lucille-san's presence is
sensing something. Niru on my shoulder is also glaring in that direction
with a wary look on his face.  
  
Someone was watching us, hidden in the shadows of the crowd. They were
wearing a cloak and hood, so their face was hidden. The only thing I
could see was that they were accompanied by a Twilight Owl, similar to
Niru.  
  
…No way. That's impossible, right? But what should I do? If
Lucille-san's presence sensing picked them up, it's only natural that
Chloe would also be aware of their presence.  
  
*'Chloe, what should we do with them?'*  
*'…Let's ignore them for now.'*  
  
As for their identity… well, I don't know (yet). So let's be wary of the
suspicious presence but not interact.  
  
"Now that we have our members, let's get started—"  
"Excuse me, are you still recruiting members?"  
  
Whoa. I was surprised when I heard a voice from behind me. I never
thought someone would call out to me! I turned around and sure enough,
it was the same someone in a cloak that had been watching us from the
crowd.  
  
"We can take one more."  
  
Kyle-san responded to the person who spoke, treating them like a
stranger. He doesn't seem particularly wary.  
  
"In that case, would you take me? I can act as a scout and also as a
vanguard."  
"Ah, sure."  
"I'm grateful. I am… Sazanka."  
  
Eh, are you really going to join, Tsuba...Sazanka-san? But why are you
in a place like this...?  
  
"Sazanka, I'm Light. Nice to meet you!"  
  
…Light-kun, the person you've been searching for is right in front of
you! He doesn't seem to have noticed at all.  
  
"Nice to meet you!"  
"Yeah, nice to meet you."  
"I look forward to working with you."  
  
Azi-chan and the others greeted her enthusiastically… No, Azi-chan was
the only one who was cheerful. The other two seemed to frown a little.
Perhaps because of her suspicious cloaked appearance…  
  
Will this party be okay? I'm starting to feel a little uneasy about the
future.
