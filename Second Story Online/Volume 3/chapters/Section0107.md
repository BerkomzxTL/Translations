# 107・Is It Okay To Kill the Boss in One Hit?

"Whoa! This is a treasure trove!"  
  
The one who shouted upon descending was Oliver-kun. He immediately ran
towards the corpses of the Crystal Rollers nearby.  
  
"Where's the treasure trove?"  
"Can't you see? The lumps on these Crystal Rollers are considered
mineral veins. So, if you use the excavation skill, you can dig up ore
and raw materials."  
  
Apparently we could’ve done the same with the Stone Rollers on the upper
floors if we wanted to, but all they dropped were stones and other
low-rank items. However, the Crystal Rollers seem to produce a lot of
rare items.  
  
After explaining, Oliver-kun began the excavation with a pickaxe,
digging with a zac-zac sound. The ore obtained would be distributed
among everyone in the party. Apparently, it's a special looting bonus.  
But monsters being treated as ore veins… We didn't have anyone besides
Oliver-kun who possessed the excavation skill. Oliver-kun isn't useful
in combat, but he's really helpful outside of it like this. I'm actually
glad he’s here.  
  
The results of the excavation. Additional enemy drops appeared. Hmm…
gold ore, silver ore, and… oh a \[Moonlight Stone\]! I think Oliver-kun
found one before, didn't he? It was what caused the previous incident.  
  
"This is an unexpected harvest."  
"Yay! Gold ore! It'll probably sell for a high price! Hey, hey, if I
sell this, I can buy my next piece of equipment, right?"  
"I think so? Bluey, what did you get?"  
"Silver ore. That’s good. I needed it for my next staff."  
  
Azi-chan and the others seemed to have also received additional ore. And
then they started discussing their next equipment.  
  
"I was just thinking of getting new equipment soon. This ore looks like
it'll be useful."  
"I just changed mine… but I'd like a new weapon. Ideally, I want my
sword back…"  
  
Kyle-san and Light-kun were talking about something similar. Although
she didn't speak, Sazanka-san seems to be pondering over weapons and
equipment. By the way, her slight reaction to Light-kun's words earlier
is secret between the two of us.  
I see that everyone wants new equipment. I came here wanting new
equipment too.  
  
"By the way… what floor are we on?"  
  
After checking the drops, I looked around again. I feel like we fell
quite far down, but I don't know how many floors.  
  
"Since there are Crystal Rollers, it seems we fell pretty deep. Maybe
we're on the very bottom."  
  
What Oliver-kun said turned out to be true. After leaving the room and
defeating enemies while advancing down the passage, we found a heavy,
ominous-looking door.  
  
"Do you have any information about the boss enemy?"  
"Maybe because it's a newly implemented dungeon, the information is a
mess and I don't know…"  
  
Light-kun and Oliver-kun had this exchange.  
  
"Hey, hey, it's a boss fight! A boss fight! Let's go, let's go!"  
"No, Azi! We're not going yet."  
"That's right, we need to re-apply the support magic first, right?"  
  
Azi-chan, who looked as if she's about to open the door and rush in, was
stopped by Saval-kun who grabbed her by the scruff of her neck while
Bluey-kun reasoned with her.  
  
"Is everyone ready?”  
"Yes, of course."  
  
I answered Kyle-san. Sazanka-san nodded in agreement.  
  
"Well, it'll be alright! No matter what happens, leave it to me!"  
  
What exactly should we leave to you, Light-kun? Lighting?  
While joking to myself, the door to the boss of the labyrinth opened.  
  
When the door opened, it was pitch black. The moment we took a step
forward, flames lit up the torches along the walls one by one,
illuminating the inside. A circular space spread out, and the ceiling
was high despite being underground.  
On the opposite side of the door, directly in front of us, was something
humanoid that stood between two pedestals with red and blue gems. It
looks like a silver giant golem?  
  
*‘Intrusion… detected. Eliminating…’*  
  
A broken, distorted mechanical voice was heard, and the silver golem
began to move. Intrusion, elimination? Considering the traps and golems
in this labyrinth, this silver golem must be part of the security
system.  
  
"Everyone, behind me! Light, go forward!"  
"Understood, Kyle!"  
  
Oh, I guess I'll put my thoughts aside for now. Kyle-san and Light-kun
went forward. Azi-chan followed them. Kyle-san intercepted the wildly
swinging arm, and Light-kun and Azi-chan immediately attacked…  
  
"Huh? Why!?"  
"The damage isn't going through!"  
  
The greatsword and dagger were deflected, and sparks of a white effect,
which appears when damage doesn't go through, scattered. …I've seen this
against enemies along the way. It’s typical to see such an effect
against opponents with high physical resistance.  
Kyle-san defended against the enemy's attack with his shield, while
Sazanka-san dragged Light-kun to safety. Azi-chan? Of course, she got
away on her own. I think Azi-chan is good at making quick decisions. The
difference in experience is showing here.  
  
"So, it's magic? Chloe-san!"  
"Yes, I understand, Saval-kun."  
  
The spell was already chanted. Let's unleash it!  
  
"Sylph, spirit of the wind, lend your power to my arrows!"  
"Power of darkness, blow away the enemy!"  
  
My \[Dark Burst\] and Saval-kun's magic-attributed arrow, \[Wind
Arrow\], hit the golem. But…  
  
"White again!"  
"Does it also have magic resistance!?"  
  
The wind and darkness turned into white effects and disappeared as
meaningless light. No, wait. Did it reflect both of our attacks with
something white? As I explained earlier, the white effect is when damage
doesn't go through. If you have resistance, the effect is only halved,
but some damage should still go through. That's why I only see the white
effect occasionally.  
  
"Finished the analysis… A unique boss called the \[Guardian of Silver
Ridge\]. It seems to nullify both physical and magic attacks."  
  
Bluey-kun's analysis report came up, and the enemy's remaining HP and
information appeared in my vision. Nullify… it's not resistance, but
nullification abilities?  
  
*‘…Guardian of Silver Ridge. I've heard that name before.’*  
*‘Do you know something, Lucille-san?’*  
*‘In the age of calamity, many weapons were created to resist Chaos. I
think that name was listed in old documents as one of them.’*  
  
A cat who's very useful at times like this! No, I'm just kidding. But
I'll admit that Lucille-san, who gives accurate information, is
convenient. It's faster to ask her than to search things up.  
No, no, what I want to know right now is how to defeat it, not its
setting!  
  
*‘Creating technology like nullification is quite impressive. But how do
you defeat it?’*  
*‘If it were an invincible weapon, Chaos would have been defeated
quickly. It must have a weakness. That's right, if we could find out
where the nullification power is coming from...’*  
*‘The source of the ability…’*  
  
The battle is still ongoing. Kyle-san is drawing the enemy's attention,
while the other members were attacking while trying to find a solution.
The golem's weak point is already known. But even if we aim for it, it's
blocked by nullification. Attacking the weakness is meaningless if it
can't be reached… the weakness isn't in the golem, but in its
nullification ability—  
  
"That is…"  
  
What I saw was the red and blue gems at the back of the room. They had
been glowing with a mysterious power for some time now.  
  
"Saval-kun, aim for that!"  
" …Huh? I see, so that's it!"  
  
He must be used to this kind of thing. As if understanding what I meant,
Saval-kun shattered the red gem with an arrow. Then, the golem's body
glowed red, and a barrier scattered like it was breaking.  
  
"It's still no good. We need to destroy the other one too!"  
  
While Bluey-kun was speaking, the blue gem was also shattered. When I
looked, it was Sazanka-san. She works fast, as expected.  
  
"Oh, the attack went through!"  
"Okay, we can do this. Leave the defense to me!"  
  
After that, it went smoothly. We've overcome this dungeon together, even
if it was for a short time. Cooperating with each other, we suppressed
the silver golem's attacks and attacked one-sidedly.  
  
"Everyone, do your best! You can do it!"  
  
Oliver-kun was cheering from a safe distance. Well, it's been like this
along the way, so it's nothing new. But, it's true that at this rate, we
can defeat…  
  
"The gems! The gems are fixed!?"  
"Wait, what's with this recovery rate! It's not right!"  
  
A panicked voice was heard. The situation changed once again. Even
though the red and blue gems that gave the silver golem the
nullification ability were shattered, they regenerated without a single
scratch. Moreover, the regeneration time was only about a minute.  
As soon as it regenerated, the silver golem's HP recovered. It seems
that device also granted it self-recovery abilities. And the recovery
amount is extraordinary. The HP that we all chipped away at recovered in
an instant.  
  
"Let's break the gems again!"  
"Wait, Light-kun! Even if we break them, it's meaningless unless we
defeat it before those gems regenerate. We'll just end up repeating the
same thing again!"  
  
Light-kun, panicking, was about to rush to break them. Kyle-san
prevented him from getting hit by the enemy's attack and stopped him.  
  
"Considering the amount of damage we've dealt, it's impossible…"  
"We could also consider retreating at this point?"  
"What!? We're going to retreat after coming this far!?"  
  
Azi-chan shouted at Saval-kun and Bluey-kun. It'd be frustrating to
retreat after coming this far.  
  
"If we deal massive damage in an instant, it should work, right?"  
  
A glance. Sazanka-san, who was flying in the air, clinging to her owl
companion's leg, looked at me.  
—\*You can do it, right?\* Is that what she's asking?  
  
"Of course. That's right."  
  
I returned a smile to her gaze. It's actually something I was planning
to do earlier. It would have been better to use it sooner without
holding back.  
  
"…Ahaha. That’s certainly true. Azi! Get ready!"  
"I get to see Chloe-san...? Yes! I got it!"  
"…However, considering the effect duration, we must match the timing
precisely."  
"Time management is necessary. The timing of destroying the gems,
chanting time, the effect time of the ability change, they must all fit
perfectly together… Oliver-kun, your voice has been very clear since
earlier. Please be the timekeeper."  
"Is that sarcasm? Well, of course. If it's something I can do outside of
combat, I'll do it."  
"Leave the golem suppression to us. Let's go, Light."  
"Eh, o-okay. No, wait, what are you talking about? Damn it, don't drag
me into this again!"  
"Leave the healing to me. Ah, but I might not be able to reach
Chloe-san."  
"Don't worry about that. …Niru, please lend me a hand. I'll need the
potions."  
  
While handing potions to Niru and finishing the discussion, everyone
started moving to carry out their respective roles.  
—Well then, let's go and defeat the invincible boss.  
  
"Alright, thirty seconds!"  
  
Oliver-kun shouted. Kyle-san and Light-kun were suppressing the golem,
and Saval-kun, aided by the wind, was running next to them.  
  
"This time, we just need to destroy both of them properly, right?"  
  
He nocked an arrow and shot it while running. The arrow, carried by a
gust of wind, destroyed the red gem. It then destroyed the blue gem as
well. He aimed for the space directly between the two. He had a line of
sight that allowed him to aim for both simultaneously.  
  
"Twenty seconds!"  
"――《Power of the deep darkness》"  
  
The chanting began in response to my words. A purple magic circle
appeared at my feet and glowed. I activated \[Black Mark\] with a double
cast and cast it on myself. My defense decreased, but my attack power
increased in exchange.  
  
"Hey, the golem!"  
  
Reacting to the magic circle's magic power, the golem started coming
towards me. As I thought, the hate value of this magic seems to be quite
high.  
  
"I won't let you get any further!"  
  
Kyle-san immediately stood in front of the golem and gained aggro using
a provocation skill. It seems he also used \[Brave Armor\]. Shrouded in
blue light, Kyle-san has become an unbreakable wall.  
  
"Ten seconds!"  
  
After taking a cold medicine for \[Cold\], I added the \[Blind\] status
ailment with \[Fine Sand\]. Two ailments to influence \[Dark
Compensation\]. That's not enough. I haven't taken that thing yet.  
I took out the \[Dark Soup\] and drank it all in one gulp. Azi-chan, who
was watching nearby, had a very disgusted expression. You'll get used to
it. The taste disappears.  
With this, \[Stomach Ache\], \[High Fever\], \[Weakened\], \[Frailty\],
\[Slow\], \[Dizzy\], and \[Food Ineffective\] were added, bringing the
number of status ailments to nine. It's a little less than during the
time with Willamedes. I wish Azi-chan could have added status ailments,
but unfortunately, our attacks can’t hit party members. We can't escape
the dungeon either.  
  
But this is enough. My preparations are complete.  
  
"Five seconds!"  
"Light!"  
"Okay!"  
  
Light-kun went behind the golem and used \[Light\] magic. Sorry for the
pun. But now, thanks to the light he created, the golem's shadow
extended towards me. Dark magic is more effective in shadowy places.  
  
"It's up to us from here!"  
"Let's go!"  
  
Sazanka-san used the backlighting to add a \[Magic Armor Break\] attack
from the golem's blind spot, inflicting a \[Magic Defense Down\] status
ailment on it. Then, Azi-chan also applied \[Magic Armor Break\],
stacking the \[Magic Defense Down\] status ailment.  
  
Let's do our usual thing. But this time, it's a bit different.  
  
"Let me show you my new dark magic. Great power of darkness… crush my
enemy! Darkness Crush!"  
  
Darkness enveloped the silver golem, and the next moment, the compressed
power was released, exploding and engulfing the golem.  
\[Darkness Crush\], a skill I learned when my \[Dark Magic\] reached
level 30. It deals high-damage dark magic to a single target.  
  
"Yes!"  
  
I carefully targeted the enemy's weak spot. Thanks to everyone's
cooperation, an incredible amount of damage was dealt. With this, we
were able to defeat the golem.  
  
"As expected from Chloe-san's magic! The boss was defeated in one hit…
eh, what? It's still there!"  
"No way!?"  
  
What a shame. The golem's health is almost gone. I thought it was
completely destroyed!  
  
"Not yet!"  
  
That's when a voice came from above, and something fell. Is that…
Light-kun?  
When did he get up there… Ah, he was blown away by my magic again.  
Light-kun, using the momentum of his fall, plunged his greatsword into
the silver golem.  
  
*‘――intrusion, intr… ———’*  
  
The silver golem fell with a dying mechanical sound. Its HP is zero.  
Looks like we defeated it this time.  
  
"It's over, right? Right? Yay! Thanks, Light-kun!"  
"H-heh…"  
"Yes, the final blow was excellent."  
  
Azi-chan called out to Light-kun, who had collapsed on the golem's
corpse, and Sazanka-san went to help him up.  
  
"Well done, Light. And of course, Chloe, you were great too. Thank
you."  
"Thank you for your hard work, Kyle-san. We were able to defeat the
enemy thanks to everyone. I couldn't have done it alone."  
  
I received a recovery potion from Niru and managed to survive, and
answered Kyle-san. I wouldn’t have been able to have defeated the silver
golem alone.  
  
"Ugh… I'm tired. Managing everyone's recovery without anyone dying is
really exhausting…"  
"Good job, Bluey. …Your tone’s back to normal."  
"You too, Saval. Yeah, good work."  
  
Bluey-kun and Saval-kun looked tired, forgetting their role-play and
complimenting each other. This strategy wouldn't have worked if even one
person had been missing.  
  
"Everyone, good job! Wow, that was quite a sight."  
  
Oliver-kun, who had been watching from a safe place, said this as he
approached. Seeing his figure, I realized that the battle was over, and
I could feel a sense of relief as my tension faded.  
  
*‘…Comrades are reliable, and a wonderful thing.’*  
*‘Yes, they really are.’*  
  
I looked around with Lucille-san on my shoulder. This party is made up
of really good comrades.
