# 110・I Could Use a Golem’s Help

I still had something I was curious about from the dungeon. It’s the
\[Golem Core\].  
Up until now, my golems lacked cores, making them instance golems that
disappeared shortly after being summoned. However, with a core, I can
create semi-permanent golems.  
  
Let's try making one!  
First, the \[Golem Core\]. Next, soil for the body.  
The soil quality affects the golem's strength, so for a highly defensive
golem, I need a hard material.  
  
I'll use some \[Iron Golem Fragments\]. As the name suggests, this is
material dropped by the Iron Golems we fought in the dungeon. Using this
will allow me to create the same Iron Golem.  
  
One isn't enough, so I'll prepare about twenty. Now I’m ready. I held my
staff and activated the \[Golem Creation\] skill. A magic circle
appeared before me. It's a brown magic circle, fitting for an earth
attribute.  
…Hmm, it seems it will take an hour to complete. I see. The simplified
creation without a core completes instantly after the incantation, but
it seems that it takes time to create it when a core is used.  
  
An hour later, the golem was complete. Thanks to the materials used, it
looks exactly like the Iron Golem from the dungeon. And its performance
seems to be the same.  
In other words, it's better than the instance golems made without a
core.  
However, it takes an hour to make. If I need a golem quickly, even if
its performance is lower, I should use a coreless method. If I want a
high-performance golem, even if it takes time, I should use a core.  
  
"From now on, I am your master. I'm looking forward to working with
you."  
  
When I spoke to the golem, it nodded in response.  
As expected, golems made with a core possess intelligence and can
understand commands, even complex ones.  
So, as a test, I tried assigning it tasks like watering the herb garden.
It seemed to listen to my orders and carried out the task properly.  
  
This is perfect. I've been wondering how to manage the expanded herb
garden.  
Earl and I don't have enough hands on our own. With the help of the
golems, it'll be easier to manage the fields, and we'll be able to make
the fields a little bigger and increase the yield.  
  
I still have some \[Golem Cores\]. Even damaged cores can be combined
into a single \[Golem Core\] if I have enough. With those, I can make
five golems. I'll make them when I have some free time.  
  
If I gather enough golems, they could become a fighting force in times
of emergency. In fact, I've seen information on message boards about
golems being used as soldiers in warring kingdoms.  
  
That makes me want to gather as many \[Golem Cores\] as possible. I
could try and collect them myself, but it takes time, so it might be
better to buy them.  
Fortunately, many people are still challenging the dungeon, so the
market should be overflowing with dungeon materials. I should visit the
Iru Mines again. I also have something I want to discuss with
Oliver-kun.  
  
"Lucille-san, I'm going to Miranda-san's shop… what are you going to
do?"  
  
I've finished organizing my items, so I'm going to Miranda-san's shop.
Usually, Lucille-san would come with me, but… her appearance is
different, so I’ll ask her anyway.  
Her current form is that of a teenage girl. Lucille-san says that while
her hair and eye color are different, her appearance is very similar to
her childhood self. Unless someone knows her from her past, they
probably won’t recognize her in this form.  
  
"Of course I'm going! It's been a while since I could walk around town
without being stared at!"  
"Okay. Then let's do something about that outfit and then go."  
  
The long sleeves hide her hands, and the robe's hem is dragging on the
ground… system-wise, re-equipping the clothes should adjust the size to
fit her body and shrink, but the clothes don't quite suit her. They
suited the old witch Lucille-san, but now they don't fit her age.  
  
"My… it's been a while since I wore such a cute dress!"  
  
For now, I had her wear the \[Noble Lady's Dress\] I started in. It
suits her better. Lucille-san also seems to like it, as she was happily
twirling the hem of the dress. She looks like a young lady from
somewhere, probably because of the clothes.  
  
"Well then, let's go, Lucille-san."  
"Yes!"  
  
Lucille-san followed, happily skipping along…. Her appearance makes her
look younger and more girlish. She's older than Chloe by age, but… no,
the AI used for NPCs is only about five or six years old, so in a way
maybe it's age-appropriate.  
  
  
"Hello, Miranda-san."  
"Chloe-chan, welcome~… wait, what?"  
  
When I opened the door to Miranda-san's shop, her kind, droopy eyes
looked curiously at Lucille-san behind me.  
  
"Chloe-chan, what's with that kitsune child?"  
  
Oh no… I hadn't thought about how to explain Lucille-san's presence!
It's hard to say it's Lucille-san… uhm.  
  
"Me? I'm Chloe-oneechan's younger sister!"  
  
Eh, Lucille-san, what are you talking about...?!  
  
"Younger sister…?"  
"Umm… She's like a little sister to me, a relative! I'm looking after
her for a while…"  
"I see~"  
  
I hastily corrected myself. Saying she's a relative is easier to explain
than saying she's my sister.  
  
*'Lucille-san, why did you say sister…'*  
*'Kakaka! I thought saying sister would be fine. Well, relative is
probably better.'*  
  
That must be on purpose, right? Seeing her gleefully grinning with her
canines showing, it's definitely on purpose.  
  
"Nice to meet you. I'm Miranda. What's your name?"  
"Um… Belcy!"  
  
Belle and Lucille combined to make Belcy? It's a healthy-sounding name.
But it's not healthy at all, considering the pranks we're getting
into.  
  
*'Even so... is the little girl act necessary?'*  
*'Wouldn't it be strange to talk normally in this form? This is more
natural and avoids suspicion.'*  
  
…Even Lucille-san is role-playing. Well, she seems to be enjoying
herself, and as she said, it avoids suspicion, so it's fine.

Additional note: Support robots have existed for over thirty years, but
the problematic AI used for SSO was created only a few years ago.
Incidentally, the Human Rights Act for Robots was passed about three
years ago.  
The Noble Lady's Dress from the book's illustrations, if made smaller,
would fit Belcy perfectly.
