# 119・Sweets, the Devil, and a Deal

Several days passed after forming a deal with Ange-san, the lord of
Dairode Town.  
The delivery went perfectly, so thankfully a considerable sum of money
has rolled into my purse.  
Not only that, but the shop's sales have been good lately, so it seems I
won't have to worry about being broke anymore.  
Well… most of the shop's sales are from Earl's cakes, though.  
  
"It can't be helped, Earl's cakes are delicious,"  
  
It was a time when there were few customers, so I decided to have some
of Earl's cake as a break.  
  
"Ah… this apple tart is also sweet and delicious!"  
  
Candied apples simmered in sweet yellow lily honey were rolled and
decorated like flowers, looking beautiful like a red bouquet. The crispy
baked tart crust was also superb.  
  
"Mmm-hmm. Really, the cakes here are exquisite~"  
  
I suddenly looked beside me and saw a little girl alone.  
She was taking small, bite-sized pieces of the same apple tart and
gobbling them down with a fork.  
  
"Wha…!?"  
"Oh my, what's wrong, onee-chan? You look like you've seen a ghost?"  
  
Ghost or not… the girl sitting before me is a girl who was supposed to
have died in a small village long ago.  
  
"You… are you Lily?"  
"That's right!"  
  
Just like back then, Lily, the demon, is here disguised as a little
girl.  
  
"Ah! Don't pull out any weapons. I'm here as a customer today."  
"I don’t recall giving permission to any demons to enter the store."  
"And I don't remember hearing that it's forbidden~. Oh well. Making a
fuss will bother the other customers, you know?"  
  
To be told by Lily the lines a shop employee should be saying. …But
judging by her appearance, she really seems to be doing nothing but
enjoying her cake.  
  
"Why… are you here?"  
"It's my day off. Are you the type who doesn't relax and have tea at a
cafe on their day off? I heard this place had a good reputation, so I
came to check it out… and it lives up to the rumors, Lily is
thrilled!"  
  
Oh, thank you very much. …I never thought that the reputation of our
cakes would reach no only the lord’s ears, but also that of the
demons.  
  
"Hey, hey, that orc pastry chef is really good. Won't you give him to
Lily?"  
"No way."  
"Eeeh, stingy!"  
  
Earl isn't a pastry chef; he's my servant.  
Well, lately he's become capable of doing all sorts of things, beyond
just being a pastry chef. Furniture making, wand making, cake making…
My, my, could Earl possibly be a genius?  
  
"But even so… do you really have no reason for being here?"  
"Aw, zero credibility! Well, I did have a purpose, sort of. But if
you're going to be so suspicious, I guess I'll forget it?"  
"What is it?"  
"Hey, won't you make a deal with Lily?"  
"Let's not."  
"Hey! Don't refuse without even hearing me out!"  
"A deal with a demon is bound to be no good. If I resort to such a
thing, it'll only be when I'm truly desperate."  
"…That's exactly why I made the offer."  
"Who's desperate?"  
"Chloe-oneechan, of course!"  
  
Lily-chan is currently in human form. No horns, no wings, just a child.
But her sly smile has a devilish glint, a distinctly demonic smirk.  
  
"Just so you know, Lily also has a benefit from this offer."  
"Isn't it just Lily who benefits?"  
"No, it's not. …Hey, Chloe-oneechan, you're being troubled by those guys
in red hoods, right?"  
"Why do you think that?"  
"Because, onee-chan… it seems like you’re being targeted by them. I
figured there must be a reason why you're a target."  
  
Lily-chan stirred her iced tea straw. …From Lily-chan's perspective, she
wouldn't know the exact reason I'm being targeted. But rumors are
circulating, so she can make some assumptions.  
  
"Lily also wants to crush those guys in red hoods."  
"An offer to join forces… is it?"  
"That's right! Not a bad deal, right?"  
  
…Apparently, Lily is an enemy of those guys in red hoods. Is it a case
of the enemy of my enemy being my friend? But cooperating with her,
frankly, is difficult.  
  
"I can't agree unless I understand your scheme."  
"…Oh well, that's too bad. But I don't think you have much time, you
know?"  
"No time…?"  
"Because soon—"  
  
A loud noise interrupted Lily-chan's words. The noise came from the shop
door, which had been thrown open violently. Simultaneously, there was
the sound of someone collapsing.  
  
"… Tsubaki…san?"  
  
A tall girl dressed in black was lying collapsed in front of the shop -
Tsubaki-san.  
  
"What happened!? What on earth…"  
"Chloe… dono"  
  
Looking at her, she was in terrible condition… her HP is low. She could
die at any moment.  
  
"…Sealink has fallen into the hands of the Laptalica Kingdom army…"  
"Eh? Laptalica…?"  
"―Ah, it's already fallen. That was fast."  
  
Lily's voice was so quiet that no one else could have heard it. But
strangely enough, I managed to catch it.  
  
"It seems the war between the Swaro Kingdom and the Laptalica Kingdom
has already begun, huh?"

TN: It was a while ago, but I believe Lily is appearing as the dead
daughter of the chief of Berry Village
