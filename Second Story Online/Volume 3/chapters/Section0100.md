# 100・See You on Stage

Today is the start day for the third group of recruits. It's been two
months since the official service began. I’ve been playing for exactly
one month now.  
  
I came to the starting plaza in Dairode to wait for my friend's login.
Oh, she must have already finished the character creation. One after
another, new players appeared in the square, enveloped in light.  
  
Everyone is strikingly handsome or beautiful. I understand why just
being good-looking is considered "average" here.  
  
This sight is nostalgic. I experienced it a month ago. I think after
that, I tried to go to the soldier to receive a quest, only to discover
that I couldn't understand the language.  
  
Looking around, as expected, players were gathering around the soldier
who was recruiting.  
  
"The Swaro Kingdom seeks new soldiers. Those who wish to serve, gather
here!"  
  
…The words I didn't understand then, I now understand perfectly. So
that's what he was saying.  
  
*'…Are they recruiting soldiers again?'*  
*'Again…?'*  
  
I unconsciously reacted to the black cat's murmur at my feet.
Lucille-san, who’s possessing the cat, looks uneasy and is swaying her
tail as she watches the soldier and the players gathering there.  
  
That's supposed to be a tutorial quest for beginners. Isn’t it?  
  
*'I hear that relations with the neighboring Laptalica Kingdom have
gotten quite bad recently.'*  
*'Is that right?'*  
*'For many years, the Swaro and Laptalica Kingdoms have enjoyed friendly
relations… but since the new king of Laptalica ascended the throne,
there haven't been many good rumors. The fact that they're recruiting
soldiers… the situation might become quite troublesome.'*  
  
It's a disturbing story that seems out of place in this peaceful
countryside town. After looking into it, it seems that it’s just a
simple test for kingdom soldiers. It apparently also serves as a
tutorial to guide beginners.  
  
Oh, that group of shiny gold people there… maybe…? It's Rush-san and the
others, everyone from the \[El Dorado\] clan. Why are so many of them
gathered here… ah, could it be?  
  
Another new player has arrived in the plaza. A woman Oni with horns on
her forehead.  
  
"I've been waiting for you, Master!"  
"We've been waiting for you, Master."  
"Ah, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long."  
  
Following Rush-san and Friday-san, other members gathered around the
woman called Master. I believe she was a beta tester, but she kept
losing the lottery until now. I'm glad she got in.  
  
…However. Is Master a woman? Or a man?  
  
Her avatar is a beautiful Oni-race woman, but that doesn't necessarily
mean that she’s really a woman. Next to her is Friday-san, who perfectly
role-plays a man but is actually a woman.  
  
Well, gender or personal information like that doesn't really matter in
this world. Unless they disclose it, it's better to accept them as they
appear. It's best not to pry unless they talk about it themselves.  
  
I also don't like being questioned about my real-life self.  
It's not that I dislike my real self; I actually like it enough to say
so confidently. It’s just that I don't want to talk about it.  
  
*'…Um, ah, I shouldn't have said that name. I think… it was Chloe,
wasn't it?'*  
  
Then an unfamiliar voice rang in my ear. A clear, bell-like voice. But I
recognize the way she spoke. This voice belongs to my friend.  
  
*'Yes, it's Chloe. You should have finished the character creation by
now. Where are you now? If you're in the Dairode Town plaza, I'm here
too—'*  
*'Well, um, I'm in a bit of a predicament…'*  
*'…Is there something wrong?'*  
  
It's rare to hear my friend so flustered. What happened?  
  
*'Um… when I started the game, there were two people in front of me. I'm
talking to them now, but I don't know how to respond…'*  
*'First, where are you? Not in the plaza, right?'*  
*'No. It's dimly lit, so I can't see well, but I think I'm indoors. And
I chose the Duo Region as the starting area, as you suggested.'*  
  
…Indoors, with two characters in front of her. This is different from a
normal start.  
Depending on your "Birth" and "Background," you may not start in the
plaza. If I hadn't rolled \[Background: Runaway\], I would have probably
started in a viscount's mansion.  
  
She ended up in one of those special cases.  
  
However, it seems that with the change in character creation
specifications, even with a random start, you can now choose your
starting region. This system change might be due to player requests. I
wish it had been implemented a little sooner…  
  
So, it's certain she's in the Duo Region, and it's unlikely that she’s
off in some far-flung area...but it's still troubling.  
  
*'What birth and background did you choose…'*  
*'Um… I was born as a homunculus, and my background is newly born.'*  
*'…A homunculus?'*  
*'Yes. As you recommended, I tried the random feature, and this is the
result.'*  
  
Born as a homunculus, with a background of being newly born—does that
mean she's just been created? That means the two characters in front of
her are the alchemists who created her.  
  
Still, for you to get a homunculus (artificial human)… what kind of
twist of fate is that?  
  
Anyway, what to do about this situation. I don’t think I’ll be able to
meet up with her until she’s completed this opening event. And she's a
beginner among beginners. She’s never played a game before in her life.
So let's support her a little.  
  
*'The two people in front of you are probably the alchemists who created
your character. What are they like?'*  
  
If they're the alchemists who created her character, they should be
NPCs. If she gives a vague answer, they should be able interpret it
accordingly and release her…  
  
*'Um, both of them are wearing red robes.'*  
  
Hmm, red robes. …Red robes?  
  
*'One is wearing glasses… and has slightly pointed ears. His brow is
very furrowed. Is he feeling unwell?'*  
  
Wearing glasses and having slightly pointed ears… a half-elf? No, no
way...  
  
*'The other one is a red-haired boy. He's been smiling at me since a
while ago. I don't quite understand what he's saying… but I think I saw
him in the Phantom City.'*  
*'Is that so…'*  
*'Chloe?'*  
  
I couldn't help but look up at the sky. What… what…?  
  
"Why on earth are you there of all places ————————!!!!"  
  
My voice echoed in the beautiful sunny sky, a sky so fitting for this
day. Hearing my voice, the surrounding players looked at me in surprise.
Lucille-san, Earl, and Niru were all surprised as well, but I'm the one
who should be surprised the most…  
  
Why are you with Ignis and the others of all places?! It just absolutely
had to be those two! More to the point, what are they plotting by
creating a homunculus…  
  
—First. What should I do about this situation? After thinking it over,
I've arrived at one conclusion.  
  
*'I know where you are. I'll contact the two people in front of you, so
please wait a moment.'*  
  
It's fortunate that they're not unfamiliar players. I was able to learn
their player IDs when we met in the Phantom City, so I can contact them
using that.  
  
But will they answer if I contact them out of the blue? Chloe and them
are enemies as characters. There are some role-players who don't even
accept individual chats… Whatever, let's contact them. The circumstances
are what they are.  
  
As soon as I put my hand to my ear, the individual chat system window
appeared. It's something added in this latest update. It’s a way to
easily call up the chat system. In the game's setting, it’s a method of
deploying magical communication formulas.  
  
*'I apologize for the sudden contact. The homunculus in front of you
right now, the player inside, is my friend. I'd like to discuss it with
you for a bit, if that's alright?'*  
*'…Ah, so that's why their reactions are so strange.'*  
  
A slightly surprised, child-like voice came over the line, quite
different from the usual relaxed tone of voice.  
  
*'For now, I don't want to talk about this in the game. I'm sorry, but
please wait for me in the Phantom City—Hey, what are you doing?! That’s
not an NPC, so don't do that!'*  
*'What's going on?!'*  
*'Ah, the communication—Anyway, wait for me in the Phantom City!'*  
  
The private chat was cut off. I'm very worried about my friend… is she
alright?  
  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
  
The Phantom City is a floating city where various players and NPCs roam
around. In a back alley, further isolated from the city, we gathered in
a dilapidated tavern.  
  
"To think that a player would enter the homunculus I created…"  
  
Putting his hand to his forehead, Oswald—no, Oz-san—said so in
surprise.  
  
"I apologize for the earlier rudeness."  
"No, it's nothing to worry about. Please don't mind it."  
  
My friend replied to Oz-san's apology. Her appearance is still the guest
avatar. You can use in-game character avatars, but… she probably forgot
to change it.  
  
Apparently Oz-san thought she was an NPC and grabbed her hand or arm. In
some cases, this could be considered harassment, so his earlier panic is
understandable.  
  
"So, she's your friend? And she's a complete beginner who just started
the game…"  
  
It was Ignis...san, leaning against the counter and crossing his arms in
a troubled expression.  
  
"We were planning to play together. Sorry for causing this."  
"No… First of all, I think it’s the developers that set this up that are
to blame."  
"Ah, that's certainly true. …Maybe it's the Word Link System's fault?"  
  
The Word Link System. I remember it being called a "Bride Gacha" on the
bulletin board. It's a system that, if a setting is said aloud, even if
it's a lie, if it sounds realistic, it becomes reality.  
  
"No, this case is a bit different. She directly entered the homunculus I
created. It probably assigned a player to the available setting instead
of an NPC."  
"Ah, I suppose that's a better way to look at it. In any case, it's
definitely the developers’ fault that this happened."  
  
From their conversation, I figured out the cause of this incident. It
seems that my friend, who chose random, was assigned to Oz-san's
homunculus based on the results of her setting.  
  
For a player to be summoned to another player… if things go wrong,
players could clash with each other… No, I heard that the developers
monitor the more prominent players closely. …Did they send her to a
place that seemed safe? Even if that's the case, problems are already
occurring...  
  
"So then… what should we do with her? She's with us now, but we should
probably bring her back to you, right?"  
"That would be appreciated."  
"In that case, should we erase all contact with her? If so, we can have
another alchemist create a setting for her—"  
"No, wait. That's not just a homunculus. We can't easily change its
settings."  
"Ah, you're right. …Yeah, it's impossible."  
  
Ignis-san and Oz-san were deeply engrossed in conversation, their faces
furrowed in concentration as they discussed her setting. Just what kind
of homunculus have they created…?  
  
"No, let's go ahead and tell the management. It was the developers who
caused this whole situation. So they can at least change the settings a
little, right?"  
"…Hmm, yeah, that's probably right."  
  
They seem to have arrived at this conclusion after much deliberation.
The setting must be difficult enough to require intervention from the
developers…  
  
"Then we'll have the developers do something about this, and I'll take
her to you. Dairode town is fine, right? Ah, please treat this entire
incident as if it never happened. I want her background to be treated in
the same way.."  
"Got it."  
  
…So that means we just need to change the setting so she’s not a
homunculus created by Oz-san. We’ll decide on the finer details of the
background with my friend—  
  
"Um, wait a minute!"  
  
That interjection was by none other than my friend.  
  
"I think it's fine as it is…"  
"Eh… but you were going to play with Chloe, weren’t you? Then you don’t
need to worry about this."  
  
To hear such words from Ignis-san… However, my friend still shook her
head from side to side.  
  
"That's true, but… this is also some kind of fate. This child, chosen by
chance… I'd like to role-play with her as she is. However, as explained
earlier, I am a beginner who has never played a game before. If it's too
much trouble, I'll do as you say—"  
"It's not troublesome at all, but…"  
  
Ignis-san shot a glance my way. Please don't look at me with such a
troubled expression. It's not like you.  
  
"It's true we promised to play together. But, if that’s what she wants,
then I’ll respect her opinion."  
  
My friend is saying that of her own free will. I want to respect her
wishes.  
  
"…Are you sure? Being with us means your characters will be enemies."  
"Yes, I'm fine with that."  
"Me too."  
  
Even if people are friends in reality, their characters might not be.
It's a little regrettable that we won’t be able to get along, but…  
  
"…Understood. If that's the case, leave her to me. I'll support her in
your stead."  
  
Ignis-san answered with a genuinely kind smile, but—  
  
"What's wrong?"  
"…When you say it with that face, I just don't trust you at all."  
"Even if you didn't say anything, I know that better than anyone."  
  
Even though I know that's not the case, it's hard to trust someone who
has the same face as "Ignis," who's been a terrible enemy in the game.
I’m influenced by your appearance…  
  
"Tell me if anything happens. I'll find a reason to help you, no matter
what!"  
"Yes, I understand."  
  
My friend nodded obediently. I was the one who invited her, so it would
be terrible if something were to happen.  
  
"You can't trust me that much?"  
"Of course, I trust you. …But I don’t trust your character."  
"……I agree with that."  
  
See, that’s the kind of face that I don’t trust! That smile! Ah, really,
will everything be alright? My friend, and her character…  
  
“You probably can’t trust our characters, but… I look forward to working
with you. If there’s anything you don’t understand, don’t hesitate to
ask. I’ll explain the setting and other details in depth later.”  
"Well, thank you for your kindness."  
  
...These two are surprisingly decent considering they’re villains.  
  
"Oh, right. I wanted to talk to you about something."  
"...What is it?"  
  
Ignis-san approached me. What could this be about...?  
  
"Ah, about that incident... Grass Witch?"  
"Please don't call me that!"  
  
I take back what I said. Calling me by that name, you really are good at
annoying people. As expected of the person behind Ignis. However,
regarding that video… you saw it too, didn’t you?  
  
"Or were you the one who gave me that name?"  
"Of course not! Besides, that video is bothering me too!"  
  
He frowned, making a bitter expression, then covered his face with his
hand as if to hide it.  
  
"Because of that video, people keep saying things like, 'But you lost to
grass the other day, right?' or 'You're acting all high and mighty, but
aren't you the guy who lost to grass!' ...That match isn't over yet, and
I didn't lose, you damn rabbit!"  
  
What is that scummy rabbit saying...? But, I'm really sorry about
that.  
  
"It couldn't be helped. At that point, that move was very effective."  
"But there are better ways to show it, right?"  
"So what would you have done?"  
"First of all, I wouldn't eat grass. I mean, it's not cool."  
  
Ugh... Not cool... Those words hit me right in the heart.  
  
"If you're going to decide, why don’t you make it more realistic? You
wanted to look cool, too, didn't you?"  
  
...To be told that by a villain. But, you're right. ...If I think about
the ideal witch I want to be, I wouldn't eat grass.  
  
"...I'll be more careful next time."  
"Please do. Win in a glorious way that satisfies me. That way I can
honestly play the part of the villain who falls humiliatingly and
shamelessly. Well, I don't plan on being easily defeated, and I intend
to completely crush you next time."  
  
He said that as if he were seducing me, and grinned.  
  
"...Next time, I'm sure I'll win."  
  
I responded with a declaration of war.  
Of course, I won't eat grass next time... probably.  
  
  
"Well then, I await you on the stage of the masked ball where everyone
hides their true faces and acts out their fantasies."  
  
As I was leaving, Ignis-san bowed to me with a theatrical and graceful
gesture. The whole sequence of movements was flawless. Is this also a
role? ...But somehow, it feels different.  
  
...A masquerade? A play of songs and dances performed with masks,
popular in ancient courts.  
This is the perfect way to describe the setting of SSO. We wear masks
called avatars and act out our imagined characters (roles).  
  
"Then, let's meet on stage (in the game). By then we'll be complete
strangers."  
"And enemies, wouldn't you say?"  
  
My friend and I looked at each other's unfamiliar faces and laughed.  
  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
  
I took off the VR equipment I had been using and took a breather. My
friend went back into the game afterward. She's probably playing while
getting instructions from those two.  
  
Originally, that role would have been mine... well, these things happen.
I’ll have to ask her about it later.  
  
Now, I'll go back to the game—  
  
*'Master, a delivery has arrived.'*  
  
A mechanical voice announced this, echoing through the room.  
Package? If it's not drone delivery, it must be a large package. What
could it be...?  
  
Opening the heavy front door, I found a delivery support robot. It
looked like the usual type: a drum-shaped body with arm-like appendages
and wheels for legs. On the part where the face would be, there was a
message written in Japanese saying, "If you wish to receive your
package, please authenticate your ID."  
  
"Authenticated with the recipient. Please accept your package."  
  
After presenting my wrist-mounted device for authentication, its body
made mechanical sounds and opened. The emotionless and indifferent stock
phrase also played along with it.  
  
"Yes, yes, thank you for your hard work."  
  
I thanked it appropriately, but when I put my hand out to pick up the
package, I felt a chill. …Is this refrigerated food? There's another
package in the compartment below. A white cardboard box with the Noah
Corporation logo.  
  
"Thank you for your patronage."  
  
After receiving the two packages, the support robot returned to its
drum-like form and rolled away. It’s a machine-like robot that could
hardly be called human. It's like a classic robot from a 20th-century
science fiction film. ...Well, in a way, it may have been a correct
depiction of history. Since that's how things are now.  
  
I looked at the delivered packages again back in my room. A small box
and a large box with the Noah Corporation logo. Both are white boxes.  
  
Opening the small box, I found a small whole cake topped with
strawberries. The larger box contained the latest model of Noah
Corporation's VR device, the \<Arc Connect\>.  
  
"What on earth... is going on?"  
  
Looking at the letter that came with the Arc Connect, I involuntarily
let out a groan. I can only think of one person who would go to the
trouble of sending an expensive real cake and writing a letter in this
day and age.  
  
*'Happy Birthday! This must be the thirteenth time we've celebrated our
birthdays together since we met. Time really flies... I can picture your
surprised face. Your actual birthday is still a long way off But it's
okay to celebrate today! Ah, but that's all for this year. Don't
complain if you don’t receive a present on your actual birthday.'*  
  
That was the opening sentence. A letter from an old friend of mine. It's
been several years since we last met, but we never forget to celebrate
each other's birthdays every year. However, as mentioned in the letter,
my birthday is not today.  
  
*'I heard you recently started playing games. You're still using the VR
device I gave you as a retirement gift, right? I thought it might be a
little difficult to play modern games with that device, so I sent you
this latest model as a present. Nowadays, you can use VR devices from
the age of thirteen, so I tought it would be a good present for you.'*  
  
The brand-new Arc Connect is sitting on the table. Shining like an
angel's halo, it’s the latest model released this year and I remembered
that it’s still hard to come by.  
  
...But if I had to choose, I’d rather have a CG Corporation one—  
  
*'Knowing you, you'd probably prefer a CG Corporation one. Sure, that
company built the foundation of current VR technology. But in recent
years, Noah has also been putting a lot of effort into the VR field
recently. I can guarantee that this latest model is better than CG
Corporation's latest one.'*  
  
The handwriting of the person who read my mind was full of confidence.
That's why they sent me the Noah Corporation model. Otherwise, they
would have sent a CG Corporation one.  
  
*'Have a good gaming life. From your dear friend.'*  
  
...Well, you always do unpredictable things. I carefully folded the
letter written in Japanese. What will I give this person for their next
birthday? They'd be happy with anything... but since this present was so
big, I should probably return something similar.
