# 128・Perseverance Is Also an Aesthetic

"Hey, Chloe. How long has it been since we last spoke here?"  
  
Ignis walked leisurely towards us, while we were standing with our backs
to the lake.  
I ordered Earl to leave, dismissed my familiars, and resummoned Niru who
had been outside the barrier.  
  
"Was it here, at this very place, that we first met? When you came to
break the seal."  
"Even though it hasn't been that long, it feels nostalgic."  
"……Enough small talk? Your goal is the same as before, right? To break
the seal?"  
"That's right. We can talk while we fight."  
  
Ignis smiled slyly, extending a hand towards me – a hand with a ring.  
Instantly, a red magic circle and a flame effect appear at his feet.  
…He just suddenly attacked.  
A skill cast with no chanting.  
This is possible thanks to the power of the ring on his hand, engraved
with a magical formula through \[Inscription Magic\].  
I evaded the silently cast \[Fire Shot\] and \[Flame Beat\] using my
broom.  
The spot where I was standing a moment ago was engulfed in flames.  
  
"It would be a problem if the forest caught fire."  
  
I said that, launching a \[Wind Magic\] \[Tornado\] while flying.  
I learned this skill at skill level 30. It's a skill that creates a
tornado.  
I used it to pull up lake water and offset his second batch of attacks,
\[Heat Burst\] and \[Flame Spark\].  
  
"Once you know the trick, it's easier to avoid it."  
  
Without showing any signs of disappointment, Ignis activated \[Wind
Step\] to increase his movement speed. He started running towards me in
the air above the lake.  
I thought he was going to fall into the lake… but then he started
running on its surface.  
…Maybe it’s the same as skipping stones. If you run fast enough, you can
run on water in this game. I‘ll have to give it a try next time.  
…There’s no time for that!  
I followed up with a relatively short-incantation spell, but he blocked
it with \[Wind Shield\]. That's why ranged attacks are no good!  
  
"Watch your head!"  
"Eh… Ow!?"  
  
There was loud thud, like I hit my head on the ceiling.  
That's weird. We're in the air, with a clear blue sky above.  
No, upon closer inspection, there's a thin wall of light. It looks like
a \[Barrier Magic\] \[Barrier\].  
It's a stationary defensive shield, a skill usually used to block enemy
attacks.  
This magic can be used like a wall, blocking not only enemy attacks but
also enemies themselves.  
Apparently, it can also be placed in mid-air to knock enemies down, like
me.  
  
Because I hit my head on the barrier, I lost my balance and I fell
straight down.  
And then I receive a punch from Ignis, who was waiting below.  
It was enhanced by a \[Combat\] skill, along with a close-range \[Fire
Shot\], which appears to have just come off cooldown.  
  
"…Oops!"  
  
While being sent flying, I cast \[Dark Burst\] to hit him as he chased
after me.  
It's an area-of-effect skill, and he wasn't expecting a counterattack in
this state, so it hit.  
  
"Weren't you a mage? When did you switch to being a fighter?"  
"I've never heard that mages can't use their fists."  
  
I was blown to the other side of the lake but managed to survive.  
My HP bar is bright red, so I quickly healed with a potion.  
So those rings can also be used as brass knuckles.  
  
"That's right. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to throw such a weak
punch."  
  
The only reason I survived is because he's not a professional fighter,
and because the \[Fire Shot\]’s power was suppressed due to its
activation via ring.  
Still, my HP being drastically reduced is a problem with my low
defense.  
Someone like Kyle-san would have easily shrugged that off.  
  
"Your magic is weak too. Maybe I should have come at night?"  
"I don't need such consideration."  
  
But it seems I’m in the same boat.  
The \[Dark Burst\] I used was cast during the day and received no buffs,
resulting in low power and failing to defeat him. He quickly healed with
a recovery potion.  
Even a skill that obliterated over thirty people in one hit just a while
ago is reduced to this when used without any buffs.  
  
"…Speaking of consideration, may I ask you something?"  
"What is it?"  
  
The place I was blown to was a medicinal herb field.  
Many colorful herbs were growing, but some were trampled due to my
landing.  
  
"You could have attacked here anytime, couldn't you? Why didn't you?"  
  
He didn't need to wait for wartime. In fact, it might have been
easier.  
If he'd broken the sealing barrier, only I would have been here to
defend it.  
If he'd come with reinforcements, they could have easily broken the
seal.  
  
"As you say, I could have done it anytime. And it would have been easy
if I'd brought comrades. But think about it. The moment the seal of
Chaos is broken, the surroundings will be swallowed up by Chaos. Won't
the people present be sacrificed?"  
"...Ah, so that's why you deliberately chose to do this during the
war."  
  
There are more people here now in wartime than in peacetime.  
There are Swaro soldiers, and even Laptalica soldiers.  
So the Red Hoods are going so far as to draw Laptalica into a war, even
though it means diverting personnel.  
All to gather everyone here and kill them.  
  
"If I'm going to do it, I have to do it spectacularly… or it won't be
any fun, right?"  
  
He took out a dark red stone. ...Could it be?  
  
"A Chaos Stone… What do you intend to do with that?"  
"Use it myself, of course. It wouldn't be fair to fight while only you
are empowered by the Star Stone of this forest."  
  
Without hesitation, he broke the seal on the stone.  
Instantly, a dark red aura of Chaos enveloped Ignis.  
  
"Huh, so this is what this power feels like."  
"To use that on yourself… You're insane."  
  
…He's insane, but Ignis seems to be perfectly sane.  
That's strange. Even the Chaos potion they brew is enough to drive
people mad.  
And yet, even being afflicted with the pure power of a Chaos Stone, he
remains sane.  
  
"Then, let's go for round two!"  
  
This time a \[Fire Shot\] came flying at me, so I used \[Earth Shield\]
to protect myself.  
The earthen wall was instantly destroyed… If a basic spell can destroy
the wall, his attack power must be high.  
I used the broken earth to summon a \[Golem\], sending it against him,
but it was quickly destroyed by magic.  
His attack power is definitely boosted by the power of Chaos.  
But I still don’t understand how he’s staying sane despite the Chaos.  
Thinking that, I can see a necklace he wasn't wearing before.  
Upon closer inspection, one of his rings is gone.  
…It seems he changed his equipment at one point without me realizing
it.  
  
"…That's a nice necklace."  
"It uses a rare stone called a Tear of God… Since you've noticed, I'll
tell you. The reason I can stay sane despite being consumed by Chaos is
thanks to this Tear of God. Heroes and Star Stones possess the power to
counteract the power of Chaos. So I thought that if I harnessed that
power, I could suppress and use the power of Chaos at the same time."  
  
He shook the stone on the necklace as if showing it off, while
destroying another Golem.  
  
"Let me warn you. This power of Chaos is not the half-hearted power
you've seen up until now. I’m willingly accepting this power.
…Therefore, my attacks will sever your connection with the Star Stone…
In other words, if you receive my attack, you’ll truly die!"  
"I figured as much!"  
  
That's why I've been desperately trying to avoid them for a while now.
Using brooms and magic.  
His attacks were already heavy, but to think it’s truly instant death…  
My magic can just send opponents to a Star Stone, but Ignis’s would send
them straight to the underworld.  
You said it was unfair that I had the guardian’s protection earlier, but
this is nothing short of unfair.  
  
"It's no fun if you keep running away like this!"  
  
He blocked my escape route with \[Flame Wall\] and \[Barrier\].  
…The level of his magic has been enhanced as well. Breaking these two
walls would require incredibly powerful magic, so it’s not realistic.  
  
"It would be troublesome if you did something like last time."  
  
Then something burst out from the flame wall… a bird enveloped in
flames, his familiar, a Phoenix.  
  
"This is…"  
  
I thought it was an attack… but nothing happened. Instead, a sparkling
effect enveloped me.  
It's almost like a recovery effect… wait, no way!  
  
"…Status Ailment Nullification."  
  
\[Status Ailment Nullification\] was added to my status icon list.  
I’m now immune to all status ailments.  
  
"What kind of curse did you put on me…!"  
"It's not a curse, it's the \[Phoenix's Blessing\]. Those who receive it
are supposed to be happy, but isn't that strange?"  
  
It's a curse to me!  
And the effect lasts a full ten minutes, why is it so unnecessarily
long?  
  
"Since I know your moves, it only makes sense to take countermeasures,
right?"  
  
I confronted him in Iru, so we both know each other's strengths and
weaknesses.  
It's only natural that I’d get the same treatment similarly to how I
handled his chantless magic.  
I got off my broom and put my feet on the ground. I’ll stop running, but
I haven't given up.  
  
"You seem eager to finish this quickly. What are you in such a hurry
for?"  
"Me rushing? Where?"  
  
I wish he’d look to his left, but he didn't look like he did last time.
Too bad.  
The information log is on the left side of my view. I can check the
abilities cast on myself there.  
  
There’s now way he can just use the power of the Chaos Stone without any
restrictions.  
I don’t think the Tear of God completely suppresses it either.  
After all, Ignis is not a hero chosen by the stars.  
Even if it's suppressed, there’s probably a time limit.  
About three minutes have already passed.  
This is just a guess, but I doubt his power will continue for much
longer.  
Considering that it’s been over three minutes, I’d guess the limit might
be around five minutes.  
  
"Well, I'm really impressed by your intuition. But even if you've
deduced that much, do you really think you can turn the situation
around?"  
  
A flame spell came flying without any incantation. I avoided it by
moving through the shadows with \[Shadow Move\].  
It’s not a continuous attack… mainly single shots? There are four slots
for accessories.  
One is for the necklace, which means he has three rings equipped.  
He could have used \[Double Cast\] to cast a skill twice, but he's only
using single shots, which means he's been chanting a larger spell.  
  
"…I won't let you! Niru!"  
  
I chant a counter-spell, using \[Double Cast\] to cast \[Dark Bind\]. I
also had Niru use \[Dark Mist\] to interfere, but…  
A sword made of light appeared, cutting through the chains of darkness,
the mist, and even Niru  
It was countered by the light magic \[Light Blade\].  
  
"You think that's enough to stop me?"  
  
What he cast after completing his incantation is \[Flame Spark\].  
It’s a high-powered fire magic skill against single targets.  
  
"The incantation time for this spell is fifteen seconds. …You can't cast
a spell that can counter it in time."  
  
To counter the power of his \[Flame Spark\], the only spell I know is
\[Darkness Crush\].  
While dark magic has the highest attack power among all magic types, it
takes a long time to cast.  
The casting time for \[Darkness Crush\] is twenty seconds. There's
absolutely no way I can cast it in time.  
  
"Yes, that's true."  
  
…But who said I’m casting the spell?  
  
"Wha…!"  
  
The flames were heading towards me, but a large amount of water appeared
right before it hit, negating the attack.  
The water then transformed into sharp blades and attacked Ignis.  
This is the water magic \[Hydro Blade\]  
  
"You've put up quite a fight, Ignis."  
"Just when I thought you weren’t around… you’ve made quite an entrance,
Lucille!"  
  
Appearing before me was Lucille-san, a white-haired old witch with a
spellbook in hand.  
The spell I cast was a summoning spell. I had dismissed all my familiars
earlier.  
I resummoned Niru, but not Lucille-san.  
This is why.  
Lucille-san can be summoned briefly in her original form, and during
that time she can use her original abilities  
Lucille-san was the one who cast the \[Hydro Blade\] earlier.  
  
"Really… That was cutting it close."  
"I knew Lucille could do something about it."  
"You overestimate me."  
"But you really did manage to make it work."  
  
Lucile-san seemed a little embarrassed, though not at all unhappy to
have been believed in for her abilities.  
Lucille-san then disappeared.  
This full-power summoning only lasts for a short time.  
  
"Even if you know my moves, you can’t deal with a sudden appearance from
someone else, can you?"  
  
Ignis isn't down yet. Lucille-san's attack was powerful, and it did
indeed reduce his HP to zero.  
However, he has the power of his familiar, the Phoenix. Naturally, he
was revived.  
But now he’s been forced to use his revival card.  
  
"You've used up all your trump cards."  
  
His recovery potion should still be on cooldown… I just need to deliver
a finishing blow.  
The spell is already chanted. This blow will end it.  
  
"No… A trump card is something you keep until the very end, Chloe."  
  
A pattern like script appeared on Ignis’ face as he smiled wickedly.  
A red magic circle appeared at his feet – that glow, the incantation is
already complete!  
  
"Burn it all to ashes, 《Inferno》!"  
  
He spoke the keyword to trigger the spell, and crimson flames rose.  
The spell cast is \[Inferno\] – a high-level fire magic spell with the
highest firepower of all fire magic.  
It was cast without chanting. And since his attack power is boosted by
the power of Chaos, even if it was cast using inscription magic, it’ll
still be powerful.  
He didn’t change rings.  
He shouldn't have a ring with \[Inferno\] engraved on it.  
  
A flame that could consume everything was approaching me.  
My vision was suddenly blocked.  
In front of me was a large back.  
  
"…Earl!"  
  
Earl stood there shielding me from the flames.  
The flames hit Earl fiercely, but not a single spark reached me.  
At that moment, my chant finished. I can’t let this opening slip away.  
  
"–Crush my enemy!"  
"Tch!"  
  
The crimson flames died down, and the surroundings were enveloped in
darkness.  
A darkness that does not allow even a speck of light to enter, and
possesses the pure power of destruction, assaulted Ignis.  
  
"Aaaaaahhhhhh!!"  
  
The small boy cried out as he was blown several meters away.  
The magic seemed to have hit him. But without letting down my guard, I
approached the spot where he landed.  
  
“…Hahaha, Ahahahaha! Gaha…!”  
  
A dry chuckle echoed.  
I instinctively raised my staff, but Ignis remained on the ground, not
attempting to get up.  
And the laughter ended with a pained groan.  
  
“Haa… …Never thought I would be beaten…”  
  
He turned towards us, still lying down.  
  
“…Why’s he still alive?”  
“Do you know about the \[Twin Gem Amulet\]?”  
  
Earl, who had protected me from the \[Inferno\] attack, is alive and
well.  
Earl survived thanks to the \[Twin Gem Amulet\].  
If something were to happen to me, I figured Earl might sacrifice
himself to protect me, and he truly did.  
I’m so glad I gave it to him…  
Ordinarily, he would have died without being able to revive due to the
power of Chaos.  
The amulet, having fulfilled its purpose, shattered and disappeared.  
  
"Sometimes it's better if your trump card isn't in your own hand.”  
“…Even so, the power of that final blow was unbelievable. To defeat me,
someone empowered by Chaos, with a single blow…! Even with the power of
dark magic, it’s daytime now, making it weaker, and you had your usual
tactics sealed. What kind of trick did you use?”  
  
The dark magic skill, \[Dark Compensation\], increases one’s attack
power when afflicted with status ailments. The effect is multiplicative,
doubling with each abnormal condition.  
Normally, I inflict over ten status ailments on myself to boost my
firepower.  
However, this time, I was afflicted with the \[Phoenix’s Blessing\]
‘curse’, which sealed that strategy.  
  
Dark magic is the most powerful type of magic. Even without any buffs,
it’s highly potent.  
However, it’s not enough against Ignis, whose stats were boosted by
Chaos.  
Plus, it’s daytime, further weakening my dark magic.  
  
I was able to unleash that power even with my usual tactics sealed and
the disadvantage of daytime because of a few factors.  
  
One was the \[Tears of the Moon\] accessory.  
Its effect lets me use the \[Moonlight\] skill once a day, even during
the day.  
This boosted my power.  
There’s also the guardian’s effect. With that, I can achieve around the
power of a normal cast.  
  
I also used the \[Black Mark\] to increase my attack power at the cost
of defense.  
But it still wasn’t enough. So, I used another method.  
  
“I only used legitimate methods; nothing underhanded.”  
  
I took out a \[Lady Black\] and kissed its black leaves, resembling a
noblewoman’s dress.  
Lady Black is an herb.  
When mixed with other ingredients while making potions, it enhances the
effects of other herbs.  
I have the \[Herbivore\] skill, and it’s currently level 30.  
Apparently, this allows me to efficiently absorb the effects of plants I
eat.  
Normally, eating herbs only provides a negligible amount of recovery,
but with the \[Herbivore\] skill, I get an effect equivalent to a
recovery potion.  
It also lets me gain effects from plants that normally have none if
eaten raw.  
\[Lady Black\] enhances the effects of other herbs… so eating it with
the \[Herbivore\] skill boosted my attack power.  
  
I told Ignis I wouldn’t eat any more herbs before, but I broke my
promise.  
However, I think it would be a waste not to use this power I gained by
continuously eating grass.  
  
“Ahahaha… ahahahahahaha!! You're always so interesting.”  
  
Ignis laughed heartily. It didn’t seem like an act.  
It was genuinely refreshing laughter.  
  
"So how did you manage to cast Inferno without chanting?"  
“It’s simple. I have the magic etched directly onto my body.”  
  
I see… so it’s possible to engrave magic not only onto rings but also
onto the body.  
He must have magic circles tattooed on his body.  
That allowed him to activate the Inferno skill.  
Since it’s etched directly onto his body, it doesn’t affect the
equipment slot limit.  
  
  
“…!!”  
  
Suddenly, the fallen Ignis began to writhe in pain.  
At the same time, a dark, viscous substance started oozing from his
body.  
That’s right, the five-minute time limit has long since passed. And upon
closer inspection, the Tear of God is cracked.  
If left unattended, Ignis will be consumed by Chaos… and become a red
beast like the former Lucille-san.  
  
“—Don’t interfere!”  
  
I wasn’t necessarily planning on saving him, but it would make things
worse if I just left him like that.  
As I raised my staff, Ignis’ sharp voice rang out.  
  
"You're planning on turning into a red beast and going on a rampage,
aren't you?"  
“Who do you think I am?”  
  
He moved his trembling hand as he lay here. He traced a symbol across
his body.  
He picked up a shard of the broken Tear of God, which was emitting a
blinding light.  
  
“It’s fine to use Chaos… but I don’t want to be consumed!”  
  
He stabbed the light, now shaped like a blade, into his own flesh
without hesitation.  
The Chaos, pierced by the light, writhed in agony and then vanished.  
  
“What did you do…?”  
“I just forced myself to use the power of the star stone… well, since
it’s forced, my body naturally can’t handle it…”  
  
His hand, which had been barely clutching the shard, fell. The shard
remained embedded in his chest.  
  
“It’s a shame. I almost made this power mine… I could have killed so
many… Ah, but… the loser should act like a loser… the dead should act
like the dead… breaking… dying… is… right… so—”  
  
And then he fell silent, motionless.  
Ignis… the enemy who had tormented me for so long now.  
When I realized that such an opponent was finally gone, I felt a sense
of relief as if a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders.  
  
*Chloe-dono! Chloe-dono!’*  
*“Yes, what is it?”*  
*‘You’ve finally answered! Chloe-dono, are you alright!?”*  
*“I’m fine. How's the situation over there?”*  
*‘Reinforcements from the Swaro Kingdom army have arrived. Upon seeing
them, the Laptalica army retreated. —This battlefield is our
victory!’*  
  
Soon after, a window appeared announcing the end of the war.  
The war between the Swaro Kingdom and the Laptalica Kingdom.  
Thus came an end to the battle of Dairode, one of the warfronts.
