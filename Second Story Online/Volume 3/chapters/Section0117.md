# 117・Dishonorable Title

A refreshing breeze rustles the herb garden near the log cabin. A corner
of the garden, where blue roses bloom profusely, resembles a wavy sea.
Golems can be seen meticulously harvesting the flowers one by one.  
  
"...I'm bored."  
  
I blurted out what I was thinking while observing the peaceful scene.
Most of the garden's work is left to the golems, leaving me with little
to do. I've already finished preparing the requested medicines.  
  
Maybe I should try and level up... Just as I was thinking that, an alarm
started ringing out.  
An intruder near the lake—it's been a while. The Twilight Forest sees
far fewer people passing through these days.  
When new players set their starting town as Dairode and head toward the
royal capital… this forest would normally be bustling during this
period, but that’s not the case this time.  
  
Sea routes have become safer, making sea travel to the capital a viable
option. People can now choose between the perilous journey through
forests and mountains, or a safe sea voyage... As a result, fewer people
use this route.  
Still, it’s not entirely deserted.  
  
I could ignore it, but I am the guardian of this place. I suppose I
should at least go show my face. It'll help to kill time, too. Besides,
some people do visit just to see me. Fan service is important.  
  
"Chloe, are you going?"  
"Yeah, just to see what's going on."  
"Then I guess I'll go too."  
"Are you going like that...?"  
  
Lucille-san, who had been reading her magic book, decided to come along.
Seeing her like that, a thought crossed my mind. This might be the first
time I've taken Lucille-san, the cat-eared girl, on a mission like
this.  
  
"It's fine, isn't it? And if something happens, I can use my book in
this state, right?"  
  
Lucille-san tapped her spellbook lightly and smiled. ...Well, that's
fine  
  
"Excuse me, is everything alright?"  
  
Leaving the lake's barrier and walking for a while, we came across a
party walking toward us.  
They don't look like beginners… intermediate level, perhaps. Three men:
a shield-bearer, a dual-wielding vanguard, and a mage in the rear. They
don't seem lost. Why are they so deep in the forest, off the path?  
  
"Oh, I'm glad we met! We came to see you!"  
  
The man with two swords smiled broadly upon seeing me. ...I see, this
person seems to be the leader of the party.  
  
"To see me?"  
"Yes, you're the Guardian of the Seal, aren't you?"  
"...Now, what is this about?"  
"Oh, come now, it's no secret! It’s said that you're the one who guards
the Seal of Chaos in the depths of the Twilight Forest… That's the rumor
going around."  
  
To be honest, there certainly is a rumor about me being the guardian
circulating. There was that incident in the Iru Mines. However, there's
no concrete evidence, so it remains a rumor.  
  
"It's true that such rumors have been circulating lately. People like
you, who come to confirm the rumors, keep appearing, which is quite
annoying. I am not the guardian."  
  
So I'll deny it.  
Many have asked me in the past if I'm the guardian or something like
that before, but most either give up and leave or I have to forcibly
send them away… but what about these people?  
  
"Rest assured, we're not idle gossipers. We're here on business."  
"Business...?"  
"Yes. We'd like to buy your position as the Guardian of the Seal."  
  
Oh my… This is a first. But not impossible. If you want an important
position, you buy it with money… it happens in reality too.  
  
"We're fine with in-game currency or real money. We'll offer a price
you'll find satisfactory."  
"I see. Unfortunately, I'm not the guardian, making this deal void from
the start."  
  
I’m not particularly averse to the idea of giving up one’s position.
There are those who want to give up a responsibility because they've
been entrusted with one that they don't want.  
  
"That's unfortunate. But can you really fulfill that role? The Seal here
is apparently being targeted. Can you protect this place alone? It might
be better for the sake of the previous guardian to hand it over to
someone stronger."  
  
They mean that someone more suitable should be the guardian, right?
Indeed, currently, I'm responsible for protecting this place alone.
They're a large organization; it's utterly impossible for me to take
them on by myself.  
If it were someone else, things might be different. Judging by their
willingness to pay, they might be able to use this method to protect the
forest. However…  
  
"…Even if I were truly the guardian, I would never relinquish the
position entrusted to me, no matter how much money was offered."  
  
It was Chloe who was entrusted with this forest by Lucille-san. Unless
there's a compelling reason, I have no intention of quitting my role as
the guardian of this forest. And I will definitely protect the seal.  
  
"It seems your resolve is unwavering… I guess we’ll give up this
time."  
"Please leave. The way home is that way."  
"Thank you for your kindness… See you again, Grass Witch."  
"Wha…?!"  
"Oh, you're not the guardian, are you? If so, this name is fitting,
wouldn’t you say?"  
  
That's… true, but!  
My nickname has started spreading along with suspicions that I am the
guardian... I'm not happy about it.  
  
"…I’m not even a grass witch!"  
  
I have to firmly deny it! Otherwise, I might actually be given that
title—and I'd hate that…  
  
《Congratulations! Your actions have earned you a new title: \[Grass
Witch\].》  
  
…  
… …The developers are monsters. I demand a title refund.  
I never thought they’d actually make it a title, just because it was
something said on the streets!  
Ah... Ignis-san is going to get angry at me again...  
  
《Mail received: ‘I'll get even.’》 (TN: the raw has this in english)  
  
………….  
That’s a single sentence from an email I just received from Ignis-san.  
  
In this day and age, machine translation is the norm.  
Intentionally sending a message in the original language means the
importance of that message's meaning is very high. For example, a
confession of love in the original language is considered to convey
deeper feelings, thus increasing its effectiveness.  
  
This custom goes way back, to a time before machine translation was
commonplace.  
There are various theories that say that the language that bilingual
people spontaneously speak is their native language, which is the
language they are most familiar with, and that the words of that
language are the most realistic. Therefore, if you want to convey a
deeper meaning, it’s better to do so in your native language, and this
is how the current culture was born.  
It's strangely difficult to communicate effectively sometimes, even with
people who share the same native language.  
  
So in this case… He seems very angry.  
What kind of timing is this! It's terrifying!  
But please rest assured. I'll show them all I'm more than just a "Grass
Witch."  
...I absolutely will!
