# 99・A Truth Born From Lies

234://Anonymous Poster \#2  
The Round 3 lottery results are out!  
  
235://Anonymous Poster \#2  
I FAILED! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  
  
236://Anonymous Poster \#2  
YES! I GOT IN!  
  
237://Anonymous Poster \#2  
I got in, but could you have told me sooner...? I'm working that
day...  
  
238://Anonymous Poster \#2  
I've been failing since the beta...is this game telling me to quit?  
  
239://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Check the official website! They announced unlimited access for the next
phase!  
  
240://Anonymous Poster \#2  
UNLIMITED ACCESS! ! ! ! ! ! !  
  
242://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Too late!! Other games have unlimited access from the start! But this
one is 4 months behind, it's too slow!!!  
  
244://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>242 It's because of my birth and background...But are they really okay
with unlimited access?  
  
246://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Wait. What is this new character creation feature order system in the
next update?!  
  
248://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Skill customization feature...?!!  
  
249://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Skill customization is paid!! But this makes me want to pay. Actually, I
definitely will!  
  
250://Anonymous Poster \#2  
The amount of updates coinciding with the third season is incredible.  
  
251://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Does this order system mean that if I send my character settings to the
admins, I can start the game with those settings?  
  
255://Anonymous Poster \#2  
According to the description, we can set our birth and background.... In
some cases, the review process may take some time… I want to remake my
character.  
  
257://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>255 Seems like it's a response to the requests from role-players. I
see that the developers are seriously going all-in on the role-play.  
  
259://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>255 Oh, should we hold a funeral??  
  
261://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>259 Character rebuilding = Stop funerals  
  
262://Anonymous Poster \#2  
What do you think of the characters' lives? Value life more!  
  
263://Anonymous Poster \#2  
This Order System...Can I think of it as a player version of the “Wife
Gacha"?  
  
265://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>263 What's a Wife Gacha?  
  
267://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>265 The hottest topic right now, the Wife Gacha. There was a player
who kept spreading around rumors about a non-existent wife to NPCs and
other players, but then an NPC with that exact setting actually appeared
to that person. A verification team is investigating it now...apparently
the results are mixed.  
  
268://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>265 For details, see the Wife Gacha thread → \[SSO Verification
Thread\]  
  
269://Anonymous Poster \#2  
The verification thread name changed again...  
  
270://Anonymous Poster \#2  
What did they do this time...?  
  
  
/////////////////////////  
  
SSO Verification Thread Part 314  
  
  
121://Anonymous Poster \#2  
NPCs seem to be ranked. They're probably divided into these three
categories.  
  
・Mob NPCs... Just mob characters. For atmosphere. Many nameless mobs,
and they die easily if a death event occurs. The number of these NPCs
decreases when the population of a country decreases. If their
relationship with players deepens, they seem to get names and get ranked
up to Common.  
  
・Common NPCs... NPCs with names, but they are ordinary NPCs. They have
more individual information than Mobs. They live in houses, and their
actions are routinized. But they're basically just Mobs with extra
fluff, so they aren't special. They don't die easily even if a death
event occurs. Many of them interact with players. For example,
servants.  
  
・Unique NPCs... Famous NPCs among those with names. Like the kings of
each country or the Five Star Sages of the church. NPCs who are
world-famous or have special status or abilities are in this category.
Even if a death event occurs, they won’t die easily. But if they do die,
it'll probably be an epic quest-level event.  
  
That's about it, right?  
  
123://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>121 Thanks for the summary. Are GM characters Unique NPCs?  
  
124://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>123 Since they're controlled by people, aren't they exceptions, not
NPCs?  
  
125://Anonymous Poster \#2  
For Unique NPCs, is it okay to apply the same death judgment as players
even if a death event occurs? They're not the kind of people who are
likely to die easily.  
  
127://Anonymous Poster \#2  
It probably depends on the death event.  
  
129://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Is a "death event" okay to define as cause of death?  
  
132://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>129 Maybe it’s an incident that slips through the protection of the
Star Stele. Like limited lifespan, but also poisoning, cursing, or when
a force that negates the protection is used.  
  
133://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>129 Even if they're not supposed to die according to the setting, if
you role-play the circumstances for a death, they die, and that
counts.  
  
135://Anonymous Poster \#2  
I tried using a finishing blow role-play against an NPC before the
teleportation by the Stele, and they actually died! It really depends on
the role-play and the situation. It was a Mob NPC, but... it seems the
Stele's protection can be broken.  
  
137://Anonymous Poster \#2  
I think it's more about super recovery magic with the power of the stars
healing wounds rather than resurrection? If you can slip in a killing
role-play before the protection reaches them, it might work.  
  
138://Anonymous Poster \#2  
The judgment is pretty lenient for NPCs, so it might work.  
  
142://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>135 Can you please drop some info on the murder penalty?  
  
145://Anonymous Poster \#2  
I've only killed one person, but... I got a wanted poster in that town
as a murderer. I'm currently on the run. If I get caught, it seems I'll
be in jail for a month. It's lighter than in real life, but in the game,
that's a month of character confinement. You can choose whether to pay
the bail in in-game currency or premium currency. Premium currency is
cheaper, at 100 star coins.  
  
147://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>145 Expensive!  
  
150://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>147 No, it's cheap!  
  
153://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Realistically, that's super cheap. But considering the amount spent on
the game, it might be expensive.  
  
154://Anonymous Poster \#2  
There seems to be a difference in financial sense as well...  
  
156://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Something unbelievable happened just now, and I want to talk about it.  
  
158://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Calm down, what happened?  
  
180://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>156 I've been waiting for a while now. Are you still there?  
  
183://Anonymous Poster \#2  
I'm a role-player, a solo player. I was role-playing with an NPC, and my
character had a wife in the setting. The cutest wife I could think of.
But she didn't exist in the game. Of course, that’s because she's a
character that only exists in my head. But today...when I logged in as
usual and started from my home...the character I set up was there. My
super adorable wife was there! She said, "Welcome home!"  
  
186://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>183 Right...that's delusional!  
  
187://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>183 This is a serious case.  
  
189://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>183 Even if this is role-play, getting too into it isn't good...  
  
193://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>183 No, what he's saying might be true. I also told my role-playing
buddies the setting of parents who don't exist but are supposed to exist
according to my character's setting, and those parents really
appeared...  
  
196://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>193 I had a similar experience.  
  
197://Anonymous Poster \#2  
No way...seriously?  
  
199://Anonymous Poster \#2  
This is SSO made by NR Corp....it might be possible.  
  
200://Anonymous Poster \#2  
It's possible, considering the Hero in the verification thread.  
  
201://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Recently, the desert country became a country with a hundred-year
history, famous in game history... But that was a completely fictional
country created entirely by the players.  
  
202://Anonymous Poster \#2  
183's wife and the desert country are both Word Link Systems, right? It
was talked about in the early stages, but it was never really understood
and it hasn't been brought up until now.  
  
203://Anonymous Poster \#2  
True or not, it's our job as the verification team to find out! Wait for
me, my blonde elf beauty!!  
  
204://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>200 Don't talk about that!  
  
205://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>202 Ah, the Word Link System! I see, let's test it. First, I have to
think about the character settings to make it work.  
  
207://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>204 The Verification Thread Hero!  
  
208://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>204 Thank you for your help back then! I'll visit the statue
someday!  
  
209://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Huh, what are you talking about?  
  
213://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>209 The Verification Thread Hero. It's about the death judgment
verification experiment the other day. When asked what kind of
relationship the players attending the funeral had with the deceased, he
spontaneously said he was a hero. That's how it started. For more
details, please see the previous thread.  
  
215://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>213 To add a little more, other attendees also joined in, saying
things like, "He was a great person," or "He saved many people," or "I'm
one of the people he saved," which caused the character to be mistakenly
treated as a hero by the villagers. Now there's a statue erected in the
village where this character rests, and he is called the Verification
Thread Hero by the residents.  
  
216://Anonymous Poster \#2  
If they're going to build a statue, I wish they had made him a little
more handsome!  
  
217://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>216 Hey, Hero! I like that character!  
  
《Omitted》  
  
968://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>183 What were the results of the test?  
  
970://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>968 It's not something that will produce results immediately. As the
reporter said in \>334, it took a month for the wife to appear.  
  
972://Anonymous Poster \#2  
We have to be prepared for a long battle...  
  
973://203  
I came to report the results of that experiment. A blonde elf beauty
came to see me...  
  
975://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>973 What?!  
  
976://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>973 Fast! What settings did you use!  
  
978://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>973 What's wrong? Be more happy!  
  
983://203  
Verification results for verification details, see 183.  
  
I went there with the setting that I have a beautiful blonde elf
girlfriend, and today the NPC in question appeared before me.  
  
She was blonde, elven, beautiful - and chubby.  
  
I was imagining a slender elf, so I was surprised.  
I think that not specifying "slender" led to this result.  
Those of you who are about to conduct verification, be careful.  
  
986://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>983 Thanks for the verification! She was unexpectedly chubby...  
  
987://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>983 A beautiful blonde elf with a chubby figure would be the best  
  
991://Anonymous Poster \#2  
This is bad... I'm getting worried. Can I still fix it now?  
  
992://Anonymous Poster \#2  
So it's not like it's going to be set exactly like that. I see, this is
a wife gacha.  
  
993://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>992 There are quite a few people who have started to verify this. The
next thread will probably be a report session.  
  
994://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>992 My partner was set as a same-sex character, so she’s not my
wife...  
  
995://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>994 It's not limited to wives, but it's understandable since the
reporter's character was a wife.  
  
996://Anonymous Poster \#2  
\>995 I wish they'd use the proper official name for the Word Link
System…  
  
997://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Next Wife Gacha Report Thread → \[SSO Verification Thread\]  
  
999://Anonymous Poster \#2  
Is this the Verification Thread?  
  
1000://Anonymous Poster \#2  
This is the Verification Thread. This is not a Role-play Thread, a
Funeral Thread, or a Wife Gacha Thread.  
  
  
1001://1001  
This thread has exceeded 1000 posts. Please start a new thread.  
  
  
  
/////////////////////////  
  
  
...I was just looking up update information to coincide with the start
date of the third season, and I found something very interesting.  
  
It seems that there will be changes to character creation in the next
update… Come to think of it, a friend of mine was asking me about how to
create a character.  
  
I had an image of a witch in mind, but my friend seemed to be having a
hard time deciding. I told her that she could try randomizing it. I
determined my birth and background randomly.  
  
Ah, but as a result, she might be sent to another region... Let's try to
set it up so that she can at least start in the Duo Region.  
  
The start date for the Phase 3 group is the day after tomorrow. I'm
really looking forward to seeing what kind of character my friend
creates.
