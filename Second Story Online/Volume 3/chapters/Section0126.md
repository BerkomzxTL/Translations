# 126・And the Hero Is Also the Type To Arrive Late

"Good morning, Light-kun. You seem to have slept well?"  
"Yeah, it was really nice… No! Why are we having a war this early in the
morning?!"  
"It can't be helped. It's not morning everywhere in the world, you
know."  
  
Light-kun is still sleepy and a little grumpy. Even if I tell you, it's
the other side that started the war, isn't it? If you have a problem
with it, take it to the enemy side.  
  
"More than that… that guy over there is wielding the greatsword Rex! Why
does she have it? And why is she wielding it better than me?!"  
  
Regarding her possession of the greatsword, I’m assuming she obtained it
through the Tsubaki-san route.  
But, the reason why she can wield a sword that requires the power of a
hero is unknown.  
The first thing that comes to mind is that she also possesses the power
of a hero…  
  
"...It's truly a mystery. I have absolutely no idea."  
  
—Well, I do have a hunch about why she can use that sword.  
But… I can't say it.  
Because I got all that information from conversations outside the
game.  
There are things that I know but Chloe doesn't know...there's no way I
can say them here!  
  
"Hehehe… Huhahahaha! That's the power of my greatest masterpiece!"  
  
Suddenly, loud laughter echoed through the area. It seems there was
another intruder in the forest, and a man appeared from the shadows.  
He’s wearing a red robe similar to Mietia's, worn like a coat over a
navy blue priest's robe signifying that he’s a priest of the \[Star
Church\].  
A half-elf man, a mixture of races, if his mixed religious clothing is
any indication.  
Oswald, one of the Crimson Apostles of Chaos. It's been a while since
I've seen him from this side.  
  
"…Your greatest masterpiece?"  
"Indeed! That is a homunculus I created. But it's not just any
homunculus. It's a special creation with a \[Tear of God\] as its core!
With that power dwelling within its body, it possesses abilities equal
to a hero… therefore, it can wield the star-powered greatsword Rex!"  
  
I see, so that's how it is.  
An artificial human powered by a \[Tear of God\].  
There's quite a difference in the abilities of golems depending on
whether or not they have a core, and the better the core, the better the
performance of the golem that’s created.  
It's probably the same for homunculi. But using a \[Tear of God\] as a
core is simply extravagant.  
The core used is surely the \[Tear of God\] from that time, the one that
came out of Willamedes.  
  
But well… I'd heard it was a homunculus related to a \[Tear of God\],
but to think it was to this extent. It's really difficult to pretend
those conversations never happened.  
  
But now I don't have to worry about letting slip information that Chloe
doesn't know.  
In a pinch due to an unknown power, a villain dutifully explaining the
reasons is a common trope.  
As expected of Oswald-san. I knew you could do it!  
  
"I want those ignorant fools from the church to see this. The fruits of
my research that you all labeled as heresy! The Hero Project is complete
here!"  
  
Come to think of it, Oswald is a priest who was expelled from the
church, wasn't he?  
He must have been expelled because of his research on this homunculus.  
This is effectively artificial hero creation.  
  
"I don't quite get it… but I understand that guy is amazing. But
honestly, I don't care about that. I just want to get my sword back!"  
"I'd love to, but… it doesn't seem like an easy opponent to defeat. It
looks like Tsubaki was defeated as well."  
"Eh, Tsubaki’s here?"  
"Let's leave that discussion for later; it's a bit complicated right
now, Light-kun."  
  
While we were talking, Mietia started moving again. Kyle-san stepped
forward to deal with it.  
  
"Ignis, don't interfere. I want to see what it can do."  
"I don't mind… But Oswald, why are you here? What about the command?"  
"I was concerned about my experimental subject. Rest assured, I've left
the command to others."  
  
Ignis was about to provide support, but Oswald stopped him.  
I don't know exactly why, but this is fortunate for us.  
  
"Kyle-san! Can you stall for a while? Light-kun, please wait for a
bit."  
"Understood!"  
"Eh, why!?"  
"If you're confident you can defeat that monster, which has a powerful
shield, the power of a hero, wields the greatsword Rex, and has abnormal
reaction speed, then please go ahead."  
"……I can't."  
  
That's not someone you can just charge at defenselessly and defeat.  
  
Regarding the shield that negates most attacks… it makes sense if it's a
homunculus possessing the star stone from inside Willamedes. Willamedes
had a shield too.  
So the strategy should be the same, but it's different from Willamedes,
who was huge and slow.  
The target is small and fast. Even if you try to land a big hit to
destroy the shield, it's difficult to stop her movement.  
And even if you manage to do that, as long as she has that greatsword,
the attack will be negated.  
—Well, there's a way to defeat her, but…  
  
*'Kyle-san, Light-kun, I'd like to ask you something off the record.
Could you tell me about the VR devices you're using?'*  
*'Huh? Is it necessary to talk about that now?'*  
*'It is, so I'm asking.'*  
*'I'm using a CG-made VR headset… What about you, Light-kun?'*  
*'Is it… the one that works with Noah Corporation's bio-chip?'*  
  
There are various types of VR devices currently available, but the
overwhelmingly most popular is the headgear type.  
The headgear reads all sorts of neural information from the brain,
converts it into electronic information, and synchronizes it with the
virtual space.  
Was it CG that first developed this technology? At the time, it was
hailed as the realization of a dream technology.  
  
In contrast, the biochip. While it's not strictly a VR device, it's
similar.  
Nowadays, as all technology and information have become data,
glasses-type devices are needed to acquire information.  
With the development of such technology, it's only natural that there’d
be a method of putting information into chips and embedding them into
living organisms.  
If you don't have an aversion to implanting a chip directly into your
body, the benefits are high.  
You don't have to wear glasses every time, and because it directly
exchanges information with the central nervous system, the speed of
information transmission to and from the brain is faster than with any
other device.  
  
Let's leave the complicated stuff there.  
To summarize, biochips are faster than regular VR devices in every way.
This includes the speed at which motor nerves, vision, and thought
information are transmitted to the virtual world, and the speed at which
that information is received.  
What this means is that the speed of information transmission also
affects the reaction speed within the game.  
  
For example, try playing a racing game in an environment with a slow
internet connection.  
In that situation, even if you press the accelerator button on the
controller, there's a lag, and it takes time for that information to
reach the game.  
And the result is reflected several seconds later. The game's
information is also reflected on your play screen with a lag of several
seconds.  
If the speed is fast, the result is transmitted and the movement is
reflected almost in real-time, without lag.  
  
*'I kind of thought so.'*  
*'How did you know…'*  
*'I heard that a lot of young people these days are like that.'*  
  
I think Tsubaki-san is probably the same. Her reaction speed in combat
is amazing.  
  
*'You're brave… I couldn’t do that.'*  
*'Oh, are you a naturalist, Kyle-san?'*  
*'Not that extreme… but something like that.'*  
  
Some people can't accept having machines implanted in their bodies.  
  
Anyway, if you want to completely eliminate lag in a VR game, a biochip
is better than a headset.  
There are exceptions in this world, though.  
The one running rampant in front of us right now is a prime example.  
  
*'Wait… Hey! Hearing that, I wondered… is that thing inside her a "New
Friend"?'*  
*'Oh, Kyle-san. Why do you think so?'*  
*'Even if it's a chip, the difference in speed is too big!'*  
  
You figured it out, Kyle-san. That she's a "New Friend."  
"New Friend" is another name for them, the "new friends" of humanity.  
Legally, they're human, so this expression is used.  
I can't openly declare that they are what they are. Therefore, I also
won't explicitly state my friend's true identity.  
  
There are several common theories about why some people have incredibly
fast reaction times in VR games.  
A biochip or a New Friend.  
Biochips are as I've explained.  
As for New Friends… it goes without saying. Their original composition
is different.  
  
*'Man… can we beat that thing?'*  
*'Oh, you're awfully pessimistic. Weren't you going to get your sword
back?'*  
*'Yeah, but…'*  
*'Why do you think I checked your VR device?'*  
*'You mean you want me to defeat it?! I'm using a chip, but…'*  
  
In a game, having superior machine specs gives you an advantage. But the
difference is very small. You can overcome it if you want to.  
Proof of this is that Kyle-san is fighting her now, and he hasn’t fallen
yet.  
It's within the range that can be covered by player skill.  
But to defeat her, you'll need both. Both speed and player skill.  
  
*'It'll be alright. For now, we'll have Light-kun stop being human for a
while.'*  
*'Wha…?'*
