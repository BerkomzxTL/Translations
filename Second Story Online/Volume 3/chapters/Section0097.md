# 97・Don’t Think About the Contents

Speaking of which, it seems that a video of the Iru Mining Town incident
has been uploaded to History.  
Let's check it out, just in case.  
  
Hmm... at a glance, it covers everything from the injury incident in
town to the battle with the demonic beast Willamedes.  
  
Hm? I found a video that caught my attention. It's numbered \#523-0-1.
History videos are sometimes posted in several parts. This often happens
when the main players in the video are different.  
  
In this case, there's a video focusing on our actions. It seems Kyle-san
and his group are the main focus of that one. There are also videos from
the perspective of the security guards investigating the assault case,
and a compilation of players who were active in the Willamedes
subjugation.  
  
All these videos are numbered like \#523-1. Among those, videos with a 0
in the number... seem to be the ones showing the beginning of the
incident.  
  
I'm a little curious, so let's watch it. Let's watch it as a VR video
while we're at it.  
  
《Play History \#523-0-1?》  
  
I checked the equipment for problems and started playing the video.  
  
  
◇◇◇  
  
  
When I opened my eyes, darkness spread. It's dimly lit and feels
cramped. The edges of my vision are completely dark... no, that's the
edge of a pointed hat. I see. For game users, it becomes the character
their avatar is using. This is probably because that's what I set it to
when I went to the Phantom City.  
  
Now, let's check my surroundings. Only the center is dimly lit by
candlelight. In front of a faintly glowing red magic circle illuminated
by the light, there are several people wearing familiar red robes.  
  
*'Now, let's begin the experiment. Do it.'*  
  
At that signal, two people dragged someone wrapped in tattered rags into
the magic circle. They restrained the struggling person and injected a
red liquid into their arm with a syringe. That's...  
  
*'Aaaaagh... Agaaa... AAAAAAH!?'*  
  
The person injected with the red liquid had their upper body begin to
rot and fall apart as if being eroded by Chaos. ...Just like with
Klin-kun... they’re undergoing a Chaos-ified transformation.  
  
*'...Failure.'*  
  
A voice that sounded less like disappointment and more like resignation
echoed in this cramped space. I recognize that voice. I circled around
to get a better look at them, and sure enough, it was familiar.  
His brow furrowed nervously while his cold, emotionless eyes were
watching the struggling figure in the magic circle. A man clad in red
and navy blue robes representing two religions...it's Oswald.  
  
*'Dispose of it. The power of the Star Stone won't reach it within the
magic circle.'*  
*'Understood.'*  
  
The two bumpy figures in red hoods, responding to Oswald's
mercilessness... that's those two.  
  
*‘Oh, did you fail again?'*  
  
A childish voice rang out in the small space. Ah, I recognize this
hateful voice as well. The one who appeared, making their footsteps
resound, was Ignis, wearing a red robe just like Oswald's.  
  
*'How many times has it been?'*  
  
I heard a click and the lights came on all around.  
The surrounding area became clearly visible thanks to the lights… but
honestly, it would have been better if it had remained dark.  
  
This cramped place seems to be inside a cave. In the center is a large,
red magic circle, and outside it are the corpses of several children and
adults scattered messily. How many people have been sacrificed here?
Just thinking about it is terrifying.  
  
*'You look much better like this than you would in a cathedral.'*  
  
Ignis said that, looking at Oswald standing before the mountain of
corpses.  
  
Oswald, who was said to be a priest of the Star Church. I wondered why
he was with the \[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\], but seeing this makes it
clear. It's more than fitting, isn't it? The red of his robe looks like
the color of real blood.  
  
*'How's the experiment going?'*  
*'You can see for yourself. Even with that amount, it seems to undergo
chaotic transformation even though it's not the pure power of Chaos...
more importantly, where have you been all this time?'*  
  
Oswald took his eyes off the bodies being cleared away and glared at
Ignis. His gaze was harsh.  
  
*'You haven't contacted me at all since you went out on that
investigation.'*  
*'I got lost in the white fog. My intuition always seems to fail me at
crucial moments.'*  
*'You even took my magical device and Chaos Stone without permission,
didn’t you?'*  
*'You took it from the church without permission in the first place!
Besides, I didn't take it without permission, I left a note behind.'*  
  
Ignis put his hand in his sleeve, took something out, and tossed it to
Oswald. Looking at his hand, I can see a round, disc-shaped object with
a magic circle engraved on it. However, it had black burn marks and its
edge was cracked.  
  
*'Why is it broken?'*  
*'I took it as insurance, but I used it to try and destroy the barrier
from the Calamity Era. It broke then. Ah, and I used the Chaos stone
too, so it's gone.'*  
*'…You! How dare you treat such precious items so carelessly!'*  
  
Raising his voice in anger, Oswald grabbed Ignis's collar. Because of
their height difference, Ignis was slightly pulled upwards and was
standing on his tiptoes.  
  
*'Oh, don't get so angry. Thanks to what you had, I was able to confirm
the secret of that forest, so I'm grateful for that.'*  
*'If that’s what you think, don't do such reckless things next time.'*  
*'…I'll be careful. So, could you please let go of me?'*  
  
Oswald clicked his tongue and let go of Ignis.  
  
...However, listening to their conversation, it seems this must have
taken place right after the Red Beast incident. I've been wondering how
they broke through the forest barrier, but they must have used that
magical device.  
  
*'If you used the Chaos Stone, the target should have succumbed to
Chaos, right? What happened to it? If we leave it alone, a ‘hero’ from
the church will come. I don't want to attract attention just yet.'*  
*'I've already taken care of it. It's probably been defeated by now—’*  
  
*'—if it’s a ’Hero’, then he was there.'*  
  
Appearing silently from the darkness was a female ninja dressed in black
attire... Tsubaki-san.  
  
*'...Why are you here? Did you follow me?'*  
*'Don't misunderstand. I am a messenger from that person.'*  
  
Tsubaki-san coolly brushed off Ignis' wary gaze and then turned her
attention to Oswald.  
  
*'I have been ordered by my client to deliver the requested item to
Oswald-dono. This is it, the greatsword Rex.'*  
  
What Tsubaki-san handed to Oswald was indeed the greatsword Rex that she
had stolen from Light-kun.  
  
*'Oh! The vessel of the small star! The sword of Rex that the church has
been searching for for so many years, to think it would be in such a
remote place... Digging through those old documents was worth it.'*  
  
 As Oswald looked at the greatsword Rex, his eyes were no longer cold,
but instead sparkled as if he was looking at something precious.  
  
*'...Heeh, so there was a hero there.'*  
*'It wouldn't be a ‘hero’ from the church. The greatsword itself doesn't
belong to the church. Anyone who handles it at that point is simply a
star bearer.'*  
*'It doesn't matter. Both are like the former hero who possessed the
power of the stars.'*  
  
The title of hero is complicated... In addition to the five heroes,
there are many people who can be called a hero, such as those chosen by
the church, star bearers, etc. Well I think the church wants to only
recognize the ones they choose as heroes, but the general public calls
all star bearers heroes.  
  
*'In that case... was it that boy? But he didn't act like a hero at all.
...From what I saw, he hasn't even been awakened properly, right?'*  
*'…………'*  
*'Ignoring me is harsh. Oh well. If he hasn't awakened, he won’t be able
to purify the Chaos Stone, even a small one... right, Oswald?'*  
*'Even if it were a small one, against pure Chaos, someone who hasn't
awakened wouldn't be able to do it.'*  
*'I see. Then that person is dead. And that old woman... there's nothing
we can do about her anyway.'*  
  
...Some things have become clear from this conversation. Light-kun is a
hero... no, he wasn't able to use the power of the stars effectively.
Therefore, Lucille-san... I don't agree with Ignis's opinion, but with
her old body, she wouldn't have had strength left to withstand the power
of Chaos.  
  
Once Lucille-san was cursed by Chaos, her fate was all but sealed,
whether she was properly purified or not...  
  
*'Ahaha, I wish I could have seen... the moment that old woman died—'*  
*'She's not dead.'*  
  
The normally very calm and composed Tsubaki-san said to Ignis.  
  
*'I saw her return from the Red Beast with my own eyes.'*  
*'Oh, that's right. But her body still has the mark of Chaos. That's why
she can't be saved. ...Even if you bring the greatsword now, it's too
late, so give up.'*  
*'…What are you saying?'*  
*'You could have taken the sword much earlier. But why were you helping
them? Did you want to help them that much? You're one of those Black
Crows. You do anything for money, don't you? To help someone instead of
prioritizing the mission... '*  
*'…I fulfilled my mission. I only lent them a hand because I thought
there would be an opening if they trusted me.'*  
  
Tsubaki-san's expression remained unchanged. A face like an emotionless
mask; her true feelings are hidden.  
  
*'Whatever, she can't be saved anyway. It's impossible for her to be
alive. ...Well, if there was a way... no, never mind.'*  
  
Ignis was about to say something, but then he stopped. …Perhaps he
remembered the method of extending life through a familiar contract. He
said it was impossible, but it seems he realized that's not entirely
true.  
  
Even so... Tsubaki-san, it seems like you're dealing with some
complicated circumstances.  
  
*'Tell your client. Since I’ve received the payment, I will do my job
accordingly.'*  
*'Understood.'*  
  
Then Tsubaki-san disappeared in an instant.  
  
*'Now your research can finally progress.'*  
*'Ah, but first, this one. ...Ignis, of course you'll help me too.'*  
*'Of course. I'm also interested in the results of this.'*  
  
Ignis approached the newly discarded corpse.  
  
*'What a terrible state... but not as bad as Lucille. That was
amazing... I’d like to see it again.'*  
*'…You're in a surprisingly good mood.'*  
*'Ah? How did you know?'*  
*'You're always talkative, but you're even more noisy today.'*  
*'Ahaha. Am I that noisy? Well, yeah. I saw the power of Chaos with my
own eyes. And… I met an interesting child.'*  
  
Ignis said with a childlike grin. Could that interesting child be Chloe?
Chloe really attracted the attention of a troublesome person.  
  
...Still, the current scene is a pretty unpleasant sight. It's a human
experimentation site full of corpses, so it's a little scary.  
  
But you could say it's not that bad. After all, the members present are
all players. But when I recall how I saw them in the Phantom City, I
just can’t… Ah, no! If I remember that, this serious scene will fall
apart!  
  
I'm very worried about whether I can react without laughing next time I
meet them in the game. Yes, very.
