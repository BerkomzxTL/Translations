# 129・Somewhere Else

The war between the Laptalica Kingdom and the Swaro Kingdom has come to
an end.  
It seems the Swaro Kingdom won in the main battlefields near the border
between the two countries.  
The battle of Dairode also resulted in a Swaro victory.  
After that, Swaro reinforcements arrived, repelling the Laptalica army,
and recapturing the occupied Sealink.  
The Laptalica army had already begun a retreat, so the recapture was
apparently easy.  
Sealink was successfully recovered.  
Garadora, the traitorous son of the Sealink lord, was captured, and a
ceasefire has been established between the Laptalica Kingdom and the
Swaro Kingdom for the time being.  
While the future of both countries is uncertain, peace seems likely to
continue for a while.  
  
“Oh, Witch-chan! I really owe you one! If you weren’t there, Dairode
might have been lost!”  
“No, no, I wanted to protect Dairode Town as well.”  
  
Dairode's lord, Ange-san…no, John-san, said that as he approached me.  
I thought he wasn't role-playing again… but it wasn't much of a problem
here.  
This is the \[Phantom City\], after all.  
I came here because I heard that the Swaro Kingdom would be holding a
victory party a little early to celebrate their victory. It's not an
official event, but player-organized, so it's on a smaller scale.  
  
“Those Swaro bastards! Next time won’t be so easy!”  
“No matter how many times you come, we’ll crush you!”  
  
Incidentally, it seems that the Laptalica Kingdom is also holding a war
reflection party at the same time.  
Because of this, arguments between players who fought against each other
were flying around the city.  
  
“Man… that was amazing. To see her mow down so many enemies at once like
that…”  
“That was a bit overkill, though.”  
  
Kyle-san appeared, shrugging his shoulders wearily.  
  
“But it really was amazing! It was so satisfying to watch.”  
“I didn’t see it, but maybe it was good that I didn’t…”  
  
Behind him were Tsubaki-san and Light-kun.  
  
“Oh my, the two of you are together… Did you make up?”  
“Yes! That’s right!”  
“No, I don’t remember forgiving her!?”  
“Eh… that’s… I really do feel bad… I thought we could play together as
friends without hesitation from now on… Are you still not forgiving
me…”  
“Ugh…. Well, I got my sword back… but…”  
  
Tsubaki-san had a dejected expression, and Light-kun stuttered
nervously.  
  
“Then Tsubaki-san, why don’t you help Light-kun as a way of making
amends.”  
“That’s it! …No, ahem. Chloe’s right, if you feel bad, help me out.”  
"...Help with what?"  
“Well, dungeon clearing and stuff.”  
“—! Yes, of course! Please call me anytime you need help!”  
  
Appearances are important. By framing it as help, they can play
together.  
  
“Ah! Of course, I haven’t forgotten my lord! If you need anything,
Tsubaki will rush to your side!”  
“…Yes.”  
  
Tsubaki-san knelt before me and bowed her head. …I had forgotten about
that.  
  
“Come on, drink, drink! Let’s celebrate our victory!”  
  
The Phantom City has been updated, and now you can eat and drink
throughout the city.  
So there were also people making noise with beer mugs in hand…  
  
“You guys were here too…”  
“Of course. We participated in the war, so we have the right to
participate in this party. It's not good to leave anyone out, is it?"  
  
Lucille-san replied cheerfully while drinking her beer. Next to her was
Earl, and…  
  
“You’re here too this time, Niru?”  
  
It seems “Where there’s food, there’s Niru” holds true.  
Niru was already eating the food.  
Apparently, the players weren't the only ones who heard the rumor about
the party in this city.  
If you look around, there are other NPCs besides Lucille-san and
company, and they were also joining the party with the players…
sneaky.  
  
“You’re drinking quite a lot, Lucille-san.”  
“Because I can’t drink in the other world.”  
  
Even though drinking and eating is possible in the game, she'd probably
be stopped from drinking alcohol in her child form.  
Here, she's an old woman, so she doesn't have to worry about anyone
stopping her.  
  
“The only downside is that I’ll forget I drank it when I go back!”  
  
When Lucille-san said that, Earl slumped his shoulders as if he felt the
same.  
…Ah, perhaps. You were thinking about how to recreate the food here,
weren't you?  
I thought it was strange that he was eating so intently since a while
ago.  
I was wondering why Earl was doing that, since he's not a big eater like
Niru.  
I'll tell him about this dish discreetly when we return.  
  
So I ended up joining in on the drinking and singing.  
  
“However…”  
  
The stares from the people around me are piercing. Why am I getting so
much attention?  
Could it be that Chloe has finally become an idol-level celebrity?!  
Thinking this, I looked around, and my eyes met with someone who was
looking at me.  
When I smiled, he quickly averted his gaze and ran away.  
He’s embarrassed… no, it’s more like he seems scared.  
  
“What is with that scaredy-cat behavior? Isn't that a rude way to treat
such a cute girl?”  
“No matter how cute you are, it's only natural to be scared when you
single-handedly wiped out a thousand soldiers. Do you know what people
on the streets call you?"  
“…The Grass Witch?”  
“It's different now.”  
  
Kyle-san, who was drinking nearby, shrugged his shoulders wearily,
opened his window, and showed it to me.  
  
“\[Invisible Killer\], \[Firepower Ghost\], \[Black Reaper\]… what are
these?”  
“Those are nicknames that Chloe got in this war.”  
“…I’d like something a little cuter and cooler.”  
  
It's better than the Grass Witch, but I don't really like them.  
  
“There’s no way anyone’s going to give you a cute nickname, so just give
up.”  
“Even so, I wish it had at least included a ‘witch’ element!”  
  
And to be feared so much…. This makes it impossible to become an idol!  
  
“Ugh… I practiced my signature…”  
“You did?”  
“Then, will you give me your autograph?”  
“Of course!”  
  
When someone asked for my autograph, a red-haired boy in a red hood
appeared.  
  
“Oh, it’s Ignis-san…”  
“Don’t be so obviously disappointed. You’ll hurt my feelings.”  
  
Ignis-san is innocent, but it can’t be helped.  
Being told that by someone who looks exactly like the enemy I was
fighting with just now.  
  
“Chloe, it’s been a while. Thank you for your hard work in the war."  
“Good job. You were amazing this time. I didn’t think we’d be beaten so
badly.”  
“Mietia and Oswald-san too, thank you for your hard work.”  
  
My friend Mietia and Oswald-san appeared alongside Ignis.  
  
“You guys did a lot too. Especially Mietia, having a power rivaling that
of a hero…”  
“I never thought I’d be playing a character with such power. But I still
haven’t mastered it, so it's a waste of a precious ability."  
  
Mietia showed her determination to practice and master it for next
time.  
…As she gets used to the game, she’s going to get stronger, and I’m not
sure I’ll be able to win if we fight again.  
  
“Ugh… But Ignis dying… I never thought he'd lose to Chloe at the very
least.”  
  
Oswald-san muttered, looking slightly frustrated.  
He’s here acting as if nothing had happened, but Ignis died in the last
battle.  
This is the Phantom City, so it’s not unnatural for deceased characters
to be here, but he’s dead in the game, so he’s a character I’ll never
meet again.  
  
“I was surprised too…. I didn’t think he’d die so easily.”  
“Really?”  
“I wanted him to beg for his life more pathetically.”  
“Ahaha. Maybe that would’ve been more like a villain… but Ignis isn’t
that kind of villain.”  
  
Well… it’s not that I don’t understand.  
Considering “Ignis” rejected Lucille-san, who extended her lifespan by
becoming a familiar, he would probably feel the same way about his own
death.  
  
“Anyway, I didn’t expect you to be able to eat grass in the end. But the
final scene wasn't bad. That shadowy noblewoman—no, witch—was quite
impressive.”  
“Is that true?!”  
  
I was told I was witch-like. Ah, that makes me happy!  
I ate grass like before, but I did change the presentation slightly.  
  
“I was able to put on a good performance in the end. It’s all thanks to
Chloe. Thank you.”  
“You’re welcome. You were a very hateful character. If possible, please
don't appear again.”  
“Fufu, that’s the best compliment a villain can get.”  
  
With that, I shook hands with Ignis-san.  
Thinking this might be the last time I meet him as Ignis, I couldn't
help but feel a little sad.  
  
“Hmm… it's a shame to kill him off here. How about we make it so he’s
actually alive? Wouldn’t that be villainous?”  
“That’s a misinterpretation! Ignis can't come back to life.”  
“Hmm…I see. I thought we could still make some more money out of him…”  
  
Oswald-san seems somewhat reluctant to give up. So, he wanted to make
more money….  
  
“He’s saying that, but I’ll be a different character next time. I look
forward to seeing you if we meet again."  
  
The character Ignis died, but the person underneath didn’t.  
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of person he’ll be next time. I
hope he’s not an enemy.  
  
"So that's it. You'll give me an autograph, right?"  
“…Did you really want it?”  
"Of course. I'm quite a fan of yours, you know?"  
  
Ignis extended his hand with a smile that was hard to tell if it was a
joke or not.  
Well, since you're asking for it, I'll write one.  
  
“Here you go.”  
“Wow, beautiful handwriting… almost inhumanly so.”  
“…Is that a compliment?”  
  
He stared at me for a moment, then smiled again.  
  
“My wording was bad. It's a balanced and beautiful script, like a model.
The more beautiful and orderly something is, the less human it seems.”  
  
I received a strange compliment.  
Well, I guess it's fine as long as he's happy.
