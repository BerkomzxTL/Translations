# 124・Connection

The red hood hunting in Dairode got a little better thanks to Lily's
participation. She's doing wonderfully, just as expected.  
However, we're still severely short-handed. I wish more players would
come… but they don't seem to be.  
The information's already spread online, but the main battlefield is in
the south, and that's where the players are concentrated. It doesn't
seem likely that we'll see a player influx like we did during the Iru
incident.  
  
  
*‘Chloe, sorry I’m late!’*  
“Kogane-san! We’ve been waiting for you!”  
  
Seeing the mass of golden light overflowing from the \[Gouro Mountain
Pass\] lifted my slightly depressed mood.  
The members of the \[El Dorado\] clan were just emerging from a cave
near the Iru Mines and running down the mountain path toward the
\[Twilight Forest\].  
  
Actually, I’d contacted them to see if they could lend a hand.
Kogane-san had previously said to call on them if I needed mercenary
support.  
  
“I’m glad you came. And so quickly… This is a huge help.”  
*‘No, in fact, the thanks should go to you. Thanks for telling us about
this exciting thing! That's why we rushed over!’*  
  
The group of about thirty people were all riding horse-like animals.
Looking closer, they seem to be lizards? Those kinds of strange
creatures can run faster than a person.  
It's been an hour since the battle began. They were apparently near the
capital when I contacted them. Although they're a smaller, more mobile
force than the kingdom's reinforcements, I thought their arrival would
be much later, so this is a pleasant surprise.  
  
*‘You were going so fast it was hard for everyone to keep up,
Master.’*  
*‘Oops, sorry about that, Friday.’*  
*‘Yes, thanks to you, we’ve arrived in half the scheduled time.’*  
  
Kogane-san seems to be having a lot of fun, and is still riding ahead of
the lizard pack. It must be really hard to keep up with this leader,
Friday-san.  
  
*‘We'd be in trouble if you forgot about us too!’*  
“Ah, Azi-chan and the others are with you.”  
*‘We ran into them on the way here. Since we were all called by
Chloe-san, we got a ride together.’*  
  
Bluey-kun explained. I’d actually contacted Azi-chan and her group as
well.  
  
*‘…Man, are we there yet? I’m getting carsick… ugh…’*  
*‘Savalllll! Just a little further, hang in there!’*  
*‘Endure! Please endure so you don't get logged out!’*  
  
…One person seems to be on the verge of death, but I’m sure they'll be
able to fight.  
  
*‘Um, Chloe-san, can you tell us the situation?’*  
“Yes, Friday-san. Dealing with the enemy within Dairode is more serious
than the soldiers outside. The enemy has infiltrated the town—”  
*‘What!? The enemy’s in the town!? What the hell were you guys doing
until now!!?’*  
“Someone, please shut up that Rush guy.”  
  
Rush-san's angry shout cut in. It can’t be helped. Even if we knew, we
had no way to distinguish them from the residents, and we didn't have
time to move the residents somewhere else.  
  
“Rush, be quiet. We won’t be able to hear important information.”  
“…Got it. Sorry.”  
  
Kogane-san is amazing… She silenced that Rush-san in one command. Even
over comms, her voice is enough to send chills down my spine. It’s hard
to believe this is the same person who was just happily riding their
lizard a moment ago.  
  
“…Anyway, the enemy has entered the town, so I would like everyone at El
Dorado to handle them. After passing through the Twilight Forest, head
straight to the west gate. Oh, Azi-chan and her group, please wait
outside. I have a different mission for you.”  
*‘Understood. …But the town is surrounded, right? We won’t be able to
enter until we drive back the soldiers—’*  
“Leave that to me. I’ll make a path.”  
  
As Kogane-san exited the forest, I started chanting. I opened a portal
towards the west gate and unleashed a dark burst.  
This time, to prevent interference, I made sure not to open the
dimensional gate until the last moment, and closed it immediately after
firing. This reduced the dark burst's firing rate because of the gate's
long cooldown, but I'm more afraid of being attacked or having someone
enter again.  
  
*‘Ahahahaha! You really made a path!’*  
  
The enemy soldiers were wiped out, and Kogane-san ran through the newly
created path. By the way, the bodies of the blown-away enemy soldiers
are still falling from the sky? Oh, an enemy soldier about to be hit by
a falling body was further blown away by Kogane-san’s greatsword. The
soldiers are getting kicked around, it’s kind of sad…  
  
*‘Whoa… whoa… seriously?’*  
*‘Rush, stop freaking out and let’s go.’*  
*‘Hey! You’re not going to shoot at us, right!? You’re not going to
shoot at us!!??’*  
“Well I guess it can’t be helped, I’ll fulfill your expectations—”  
*‘No no no no, seriously stop it!!!!!!!’*  
  
You don't have to be so scared. We're on the same side, so you won't
die, you'll just get blown away. …But Rush-san has acrophobia.  
  
*‘Hiee… when we’re fighting in town, nothing will fall from above,
right?’*  
“Sorry, Azi-san. You and your group will stay outside with
Tsubaki-san.”  
*‘N-no way!’*  
  
Ignoring Azi-chan's scream, I handed them over to Tsubaki-san. There are
many troublesome people outside too. We’ve already identified them, so
dealing with them decisively will eliminate the threat, but Tsubaki-san
alone can’t handle it.  
It’s fine, you'll only get blown away a little. I don't know if you’ll
die from fall damage, though.  
  
*‘…That’s right! There won’t be any aerial attacks in the town!’*  
“You seem really happy, Rush-san.”  
*‘Shut up. Anyway, I can rampage without worrying about you and protect
the town.’*  
  
You seem more motivated than usual, Rush-san.  
He usually doesn't seem to like this kind of thing.  
  
*‘Wait for me, Miranda-san! Now that I’m here, I’ll knock everyone
down!!’*  
  
…Ah. I see. I understand. That certainly would boost morale.  
So let’s keep quiet about the fact that Miranda-san hasn't logged in
today.  
We need to maintain soldier morale, after all. We mustn’t do anything
that lowers it. I care about my soldiers!  
By the way, please rest assured that Klin-kun is safe and secure.  
  
Now… with the extra manpower, we should be able to manage.  
…That’s what I thought.  
  
“Chloe, it looks like there are intruders in the forest.”  
  
After hearing Lucille-san’s report and looking into the Twilight Forest,
I saw two intruders. They were heading towards the lake.  
  
*‘...Tsubaki-san, can you please have Azi-chan’s group take over that
area and move to the location I’m about to specify immediately?’*  
*‘Chloe-dono, what’s wrong?’*  
*‘I’ve spotted some troublesome individuals.’*  
  
They were the same height and wore red-hooded robes.  
They effortlessly defeated the forest monsters attacking them and
continued to advance.  
One burned them with fire magic, the other cut them down with a
greatsword.  
The greatsword had a white blade, and it looked like…  
  
“That’s… could that be the greatsword Rex?”

Why is Dairode also a battlefield?!  
  
206://Anonymous 2  
You did it, Laptalicaaaaaaaaaaa!!!  
  
208://Anonymous 2  
No, we didn’t know either… (Laptalica soldier)  
  
210://Anonymous 2  
Whoever did that, good job.  
  
213://Anonymous 2  
Ah, so Sealink's son betrayed them. I see…  
  
215://Anonymous 2  
It's fine to have a live report, but both sides should stop revealing
information~  
  
250://Anonymous 2  
I thought Dairode was over… but the Laptalica soldiers were blown
away???  
  
255://Anonymous 2  
Hey, wasn’t this supposed to be an easy battlefield! Hey!!  
  
256://Anonymous 2  
I was blown to smithereens!!??  
  
258://Anonymous 2  
What the heck is going on?! Where did that happen?!  
  
260://Anonymous 2  
It’s in Dairode. Suddenly, instant-death magic rained down on the
Laptalica army. Multiple times. Because of that, the Laptalica army was
completely annihilated in less than twenty minutes.  
  
266://Anonymous 2  
Huuuuh???  
  
267://Anonymous 2  
Don’t lie. You’re trying to spread false information to cause chaos on
the battlefield, aren’t you?  
  
268://Anonymous 2  
If you don’t believe me, come here!  
  
269://Anonymous 2  
I was going to go as a Swaro soldier reinforcement, but I’m gonna pass…
I don’t want to go to such a scary battlefield.  
  
270://Anonymous 2  
Me too, I was going to go as Laptalica reinforcement, but I’ll pass.  
  
290://Anonymous 2  
I, a Laptalica soldier, thought I died after being blown away, but then
a blonde girl knocked me away again…  
  
293://Anonymous 2  
Is Dairode hell?  
  
295://Anonymous 2  
I’d rather go to the main battlefield!  
  
298://Anonymous 2  
The main battlefield is hell too…  
  
299://Anonymous 2  
It’s a war, of course it’s hell everywhere.
