# 120・Announcing the Outbreak of War

"You... aren't you Tsubaki? Why are you here?"  
  
Lucille-san seems to have noticed the commotion and came out from the
back of the shop.  
  
"I don't know the full details yet, but apparently Sealink has been
occupied by the Laptalica army…"  
"Occupied...? Even if that's true, there was no warning whatsoever. It's
impossible for it to be occupied so quickly. Shouldn't the lord or the
army have mobilized first?"  
  
Certainly, if there was any kind of disturbance in Sealink, we should
have received information first. If it was an occupation, a battle would
definitely have occurred. If this was a request for reinforcements, I'd
understand immediately, but the information received was simply that
Sealink has been occupied. It's far too soon.  
  
"Eh… Sealink...?"  
"Is there really a war with Laptalica?!"  
  
The shop began to buzz with commotion. Even if there are only a few
people, we can't continue this conversation here.  
I immediately closed the shop temporarily and decided to hear the story
from Tsubaki-san again. ...In the meantime, Lily-chan seemed to have
disappeared, and I didn't bother looking for her.  
  
"So, how does Tsubaki-san have that information, and why did you tell
me?"  
  
Tsubaki-san is connected to those guys in the red hoods. She doesn’t
seem to be one of them, but she is close to them. I wonder why she came
to tell me about Sealink.  
Tsubaki-san is still in a tattered state. Even without giving her a
potion, her HP will gradually recover naturally, so it's fine. Besides,
I don't intend to be unnecessarily kind to someone whose allegiances are
still unknown.  
  
"I need to explain in order... I was acting under the employment of a
certain person, as a member of the \[Black Crows\]."  
"Black Crows... I had a feeling that's what it was."  
"You know about them?"  
"The Black Crows is one of those shadowy guilds that will do anything
from kidnapping to assassination, as long as they're paid."  
  
Come to think of it, they came up in a video I saw before where
Tsubaki-san was talking to those guys in red hoods. This is the first
time I've actually learned she's a member of that organization though,
so I'll act accordingly.  
  
"By the way, Chloe-dono... who is that person?"  
"She's my relative. She's quite knowledgeable about various things."  
  
Lucille-san's explanations are also helpful.  
Well, leaving Lucille-san aside, let's continue the story.  
  
"So, who is your employer? It's not Ignis and the others, is it?"  
"My employer... Garadora-sama, the eldest son of the lord of Sealink."  
  
...That's a name I've never heard before. But it's surprising that that
name came up here.  
  
"I see... I understand how you obtained information about the current
situation in Sealink... It's likely that the occupation was also
orchestrated by this Garadora fellow?"  
"Your understanding is swift. That is correct. Garadora-sama is in
league with Laptalica, and he invited them to Sealink."  
"And it seems safe to assume they're connected to the Crimson Apostles
of Chaos?"  
"As I only acted on orders, I wasn't told anything beyond my
orders...but from my observations, it seems the Apostles themselves are
also connected to Laptalica. It seems that Garadora-sama approached them
through Ignis-dono and the others."  
  
...I never would’ve imagined that the people in red hoods were also
backed by Laptalica.  
The son of the lord of Sealink... I don't know much about this man named
Garadora, but I'm starting to get the picture. Tsubaki-san was hired by
Garadora and acted as his hands and feet, cooperating with Ignis and the
others.  
  
"...The Sealink lord's family has the trust of the royal family. That's
why they were entrusted with that port town. In times like this, the
port should’ve been carefully managed so that it wouldn’t easily fall
into enemy hands... and yet, they've betrayed us."  
  
Lucille-san was stunned, as if she couldn't believe what she had heard…
Indeed, a port is a crucial location. It can only be entrusted to
someone who is trustworthy.  
  
"Was it only the son who betrayed them?"  
"Yes, it seems to have been a scheme by Garadora-sama alone. The lord...
Garadora's parents are imprisoned."  
"Hmm... I see. Still, it's hard to believe..."  
  
They probably betrayed the kingdom after being tempted by Laptalica's
power.  
  
"Now then. Having heard most of it, I'll ask: this story isn't a lie, is
it?"  
  
The problem is the credibility of this story. If Tsubaki-san herself is
still on their side, there's a possibility that this is false
information meant to deceive us.  
  
"It is not a lie…"  
"Given your position, you should have known about the impending war much
earlier. If Sealink's fall is true, why did you betray them only now?
You could have acted before the Laptalica army arrived."  
"That is true… I was wavering… For a member of the Black Crows to
disobey the client's orders is a forbidden act. It's tantamount to
betraying the organization that picked me up and raised me, my
family."  
  
Tsubaki-san, who had been speaking with her eyes closed, suddenly opened
them.  
  
"But... I suddenly thought... Chloe-dono is in this town. If the person
who called me a friend were to be caught in the flames of war... I
wouldn't want that."  
  
Her red eyes didn't waver in the pain of disobeying orders, but held a
gentle light.  
  
"Besides, didn't you say you would help me?"  
"Now that I think of it, I did say something like that."  
"I wouldn't want you to forget. I betrayed my entire life for you! This
information, my betrayal—it should benefit Chloe-dono. If I lied, then
kill me. I'll even commit seppuku."  
"To be honest, if you care about me, you should have told me before the
Laptalica army appeared, as I said before... but I suppose you had your
reasons. I understand your sincerity, and as a friend, I'll believe your
words."  
  
If she's a double agent, I'm done for... but she doesn't seem like that
type of person, so I'll assume it’ll be okay.  
  
"Really…!"  
  
Tsubaki-san's happy expression as she looked at me… Is this expression
an act? She looks incredibly happy. Seeing this makes it seem unlikely
that she's lying.  
  
"Well then… we don't have much time."  
  
If Sealink is already in Laptalica's hands, it won't be long before
Dairode Town becomes a battlefield. In that case—I'd better let that
person know about this.  
  
"By the way, Tsubaki-san, do you know where the Hero's Sword is?"  
"I gave it to Oswald-dono and haven't heard anything since…"  
  
I thought Tsubaki-san, who stole it, might know something, but it seems
she doesn't.  
  
"Then do you know anything about the girl with white hair? A girl named
Mietia?"  
"Hmm… I have heard the name Mietia before. I believe there was someone
like that around Oswald-dono and Ignis-dono recently."  
  
Hmm… my friend seems to be hanging around Ignis and the others… At this
rate, we'll probably meet on the battlefield.  
Well, we'll find out sooner or later. Let's go see the person I should
visit first.  
  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
"I see… so that's why you came to me."  
  
The lord of Dairode, Ange-san, had a grave expression.  
I learned from Tsubaki-san's report that Sealink had fallen into the
hands of the Laptalica army.  
The Laptalica army's next target is Dairode… meaning this town.  
It's a matter beyond my capabilities alone, and it's something that
Ange-san, the lord of this town, should know, so I came to tell her.  
  
The Laptalica Kingdom is a country located southeast of the Swaro
Kingdom. Lucille-san said that it's a country of similar size to Swaro,
and that they had been allies for many years.  
  
"I knew the relationship between Swaro and Laptalica had been bad
recently… and I expected a war to break out soon… but I never thought we
would get dragged into it."  
  
Dairode Town is far from Laptalica. So, even if a war broke out, the
main battleground was thought to be near the border between Swaro and
Laptalica.  
  
"Regardless, thank you for bringing me the information. …But how
credible is this story? Even if the Laptalica forces managed to
infiltrate Sealink smoothly, it's strange that no information about it
has reached us. I sent a messenger to the port, but I haven't received
any reports from them. I haven't received any news from the country
about anything happening between them and Laptalica. They can report
with a single communication, can't they?"  
  
Ange-san put her hand to her ear. As if making a phone call. In this
world's setting, personal communication through magic is possible, so
regardless of whether they are players or NPCs, they can talk to each
other from a distance, like in real life.  
  
"You say that that child is the source of this rumor, but she didn't
need to come here to report in person, did she?"  
  
Ange-san looked at Tsubaki-san next to her. ...It certainly could have
been done with a single call. There was no need for her to go out of her
way to report in person at such risk.  
  
"...I am ashamed of that. I initially intended to do so, but the other
side sensed my movements… I barely escaped and managed to reach
Chloe-dono."  
  
She must have been hesitant until the moment just before her betrayal.
If she were discovered at that point and had to flee, she wouldn't have
had time to contact me. Due to the recent update, it's no longer
possible to communicate without putting your hand to your ear. If your
hands are restrained, communication is completely impossible.  
  
"...Well, whatever. We'll find out soon enough. For now, how about some
tea?"  
  
Ange-san didn't seem flustered, and calmly instructed the maid to
prepare tea.  
  
"Tea... I understand you might not believe this story, but we don't have
time for leisurely tea. Do you really care what happens to the town?”  
"I told you, didn’t I? We'll find out soon enough."  
  
Ange-san's expression suddenly changed. Her posture, previously elegant
and composed, fell apart. Her legs spread out as she sprawled across the
sofa.  
  
"―From here on out, we’ll be off the record. If what you say is true,
then war is about to start. But this is what? Not the real world, it's a
game. Games have rules. And of course, war has rules."  
  
Suddenly, a deafening siren blared. Along with a flood of sound that
filled my ears, a window appeared across my entire vision.  
  
《The Laptalica Kingdom has declared war on the Swaro Kingdom! The
relevant regions will now enter a state of war.》  
  
"It seems your story was true after all. Welcome to the battlefield."  
  
John-san smirked from across the window.
