# 109・The Explosive Birth of a Cat-Eared Loli-Baba

Well, let's log in and play the game again today. I'm back in the same
place I logged out last time, in the log cabin in the Twilight Forest.
Earl and Belle were there to greet me when I arrived.  
Shall we summon one more person and one more creature? I raised my staff
and cast the spell.  
  
"Appear, my familiar!"  
  
First, I summoned Niru. A large owl-like monster appeared, his eyes
half-closed as usual, looking sleepy. Niru immediately flew to his
favorite perch and went back to sleep.  
  
"Ah, I slept well."  
  
Next, I summoned Lucille-san. A white-haired old witch in a witch's robe
appeared… What?  
  
"Lucille-san, you're still in human form..."  
  
Usually, she immediately becomes a spirit and possesses Belle, but today
she's maintaining her human form.  
  
"Hmm... Could it be because your summoning magic ability has
improved?"  
  
Now that I think about it, I have indeed leveled up. In other words…
I’ve reached the level where I can summon Lucille-san in her human
form!  
  
"Wait...huh?"  
"Oh, I've become a spirit..."  
  
My joy was short-lived. After a while, Lucille-san turned into a spirit.
Apparently, my level isn't quite high enough to maintain her human form
completely.  
  
"I might need more training to raise my level."  
"I don’t really mind my current form. No need to be so hasty… No, wait.
Perhaps I could obtain a human body."  
"Really?"  
"When you summoned me earlier, I maintained my human form longer. And I
felt I could use more of my original power...so please summon me again.
Maybe I can do it then."  
  
If so, let's try it now! I unsummoned Lucille-san and summoned her
again.  
  
"Alright...it seems possible. Then, Belle, please become my familiar
once more."  
  
A white-haired old witch appeared, as expected. She examined her hands
as if checking her body, then smiled deeply, wrinkling her face, and
made a contract with Belle to become her familiar.  
  
"—My familiar. By this contract, lend me your power. Your soul, your
body, as my hands and feet!"  
  
Lucille-san is chanting as she holds her staff in hand. The magic she’s
using is… Eh, fusion?  
As the incantation ended, a magic circle appeared at Lucille-san's feet,
and she began to shine. When the explosion of light subsided, there was
someone standing there…  
  
"Yes! I've done it, Chloe!"  
  
I was surprised to hear such a young voice. No, there is something even
more surprising.  
Before I knew it, a strange girl had appeared in front of me.  
  
She has black cat ears and hair that is a mix of black and white. Her
blue and gold heterochromatic eyes are sparkling like a child, as if her
prank was a success. She’s wearing an adult's robe that’s too big for
her.  
The clothes were the same ones Lucille-san had been wearing until just
now. Incidentally, she was clutching the staff Lucille-san had been
holding in her small hands.  
  
"...Lucille-san, right?"  
"Hehehe! Who else would it be?"  
  
She laughed in a cheerful childish voice. No matter how many times I
look, there is a teenage girl with cat ears, not a white-haired old
woman.  
  
"What's going on...?"  
"I remade the familiar contract with Belle. Then, I summoned myself
again to fuse with my body. So this body is half Belle's."  
"I see..."  
  
Lucille-san is now my familiar. I need to create a spirit body using my
magic, but I'm still not skilled enough. I can only create an unstable
spirit body that quickly disappears. To compensate, Lucille-san borrowed
Belle's spirit body.  
It's similar to possession, but a little different. Possession borrows
the other's body entirely, but this is a fusion of two bodies. That's
why she has cat ears and a tail.  
  
"Being a cat wasn't bad, but a human form is still the best
Hmm...however..."  
  
"Hmm," said the cat-eared girl, stretching. Then, trailing the hem of
her robe, she stood before the mirror.  
  
"I'm very cute, am I not?"  
"Why are you calling yourself cute, you cat-eared loli-baba."  
"Oh, don't be so blunt. I'm also a delicate maiden, I'm a little hurt
you know."  
  
I blurted it out without thinking...please don't start fake crying.  
She is cute, though. Although it's still Lucille-san inside.  
Well, it’s not that I don’t get it. When I first started playing the
game, I was also excited when creating Chloe's appearance.  
  
"Now then, Earl! Excuse me, but could you please make some tea? I'm
craving a proper meal with someone for a change!"  
  
She recovered quickly...or rather, those words alone probably won’t have
any effect on Lucille-san. She walked towards the table. Now that I
think about it, it's been a while since she's had a human meal. She
couldn't before because she didn't have a human body.  
  
While drinking tea, I decided to sort through the items I obtained from
the dungeon in the Iru Mines that I cleared recently. I need to separate
the necessary items from the unnecessary ones.  
  
"Beautiful..."  
  
I held the amethyst up to the light. The purple stone sparkled and shone
brightly as the light filtered through it.  
Even though this is just a mass of data and not a real thing, being able
to gaze at a jewel the size of my palm is something rarely possible in
reality, so I can’t help but be captivated by it.  
  
I got this amethyst in the dungeon. Apparently, it's compatible with
dark magic. Making a weapon with it would increase my dark magic
power.  
As someone fascinated by the high power of dark magic, I couldn't
possibly pass up this opportunity.  
  
However, the problem is how to make weapons… A staff in my case. I can't
make it myself because I lack the skill, so it’s impossible. So I should
commission a craftsman to make it for me.  
  
Just as I was thinking of consulting the weapon craftsman in Dairode
Town, Earl tapped me on the shoulder.  
  
"What's with this staff?"  
  
In his hand he was holding a staff. It was made of wood, and probably
with lower performance than my current one. This is due to the wood and
materials, but at the very least it seems to have the minimum functions
of a staff.  
  
It's too low performance for a new staff. Does Earl use it? He doesn't
use magic...or maybe he does, secretly.  
  
Earl, noticing my confusion, picked up a woodworking tool and made a
gesture as if to carve something.  
  
"Did you make this, Earl?"  
  
Earl nodded. But why...?  
  
"...Is it for me?"  
  
This time he nodded vigorously.  
  
"It seems like he's been working hard for you up until now. With Earl's
current skill, if he had the materials, he could make the perfect staff
for you."  
  
The cat-eared girl, sitting on a cushioned chair, said this while
drinking tea. Her tail was swaying happily… I still haven't gotten used
to the fact that this girl is Lucille-san.  
  
However, thinking about it carefully, Earl has made furniture and
walking sticks for people in need before. I assumed that it was just his
hobby, something he wanted to do, but it was for me...?  
  
"Thank you, Earl."  
  
Earl shook his head. It seemed as if he was saying that he hasn't yet
done something worth my thanks. Since Earl will make it, I think I'll
leave it to him. For that, I have to prepare the materials and such. I
should ask Miranda-san about that.

Simply put, it's like Fusion Summoning or Fusion, that sort of thing.
She doesn't get particularly stronger.
