# 112・Port Town Sealink

We left through the east gate of Dairode Town and just followed the
road. There were no particular problems along the way and we soon
arrived at Sealink.  
  
\[Duo Region/Port Town Sealink\]  
  
"Oh… so this is Sealink?"  
  
Passing through the gate, a town similar to Dairode can be seen. In the
distance beyond the town, you can see the blue sea and large ships at
anchor. The sea breeze is blowing, and you can faintly smell the
seashore.  
  
Near the dock, we found the market we were looking for. It was
overflowing with people and goods. Being close to the sea, seafood like
fish and shellfish were being sold. There are also goods that seem to be
from merchant ships, which I don't see very often around here.  
  
"Ah! That looks really interesting~! Let's go take a look, Klin!"  
"Manager, please wait. You mustn't buy strange things again, okay?"  
  
As soon as they arrived, Miranda-san seemed to have found something
interesting, and she went off while pulling Klin-kun's hand.  
  
"That… is that perhaps ore from the southern region?"  
  
Oliver-kun also seemed interested in something and headed over to it.  
  
"Well, let's look around too… huh? Niru and Luci… where did Belcy go?"  
  
Niru and Lucille-san, who had been nearby a moment ago, were gone...
Then, Earl pointed in a certain direction.  
  
The two were in front of a stall selling grilled fish. Niru's eyes,
which always look sleepy, were wide open and he was staring intently at
the fish being grilled with sparkling eyes.  
  
"This… looks delicious."  
  
Lucille-san was also looking into the stall, swaying her tail gently and
stretching out on tiptoes. She was looking at the sizzling fish with the
same sparkling eyes as Niru.  
What are you doing, you two...? The shop assistant is looking at you
with a troubled expression, you know.  
  
"Chloe, Chloe! Please buy this for me!"  
  
As if to back her up, Niru nodded rapidly. It was as if they wanted to
eat it right away.  
I understand Niru being a glutton… but why Lucille-san too? Is it
because she's a cat? Or is it because Belle, who's half-cat, is
attracted to the fish?  
  
"Alright, alright!"  
  
Standing like that in front of the stall will attract too much
attention. I have no choice but to buy grilled fish for each of them.  
  
"Delicious… so delicious!"  
  
Lucille-san was happily stuffing her face with freshly grilled fish.
Perhaps because she has a cat's tongue? She’s eating it while blowing on
it to cool it down. Next to her, Niru is also pecking at his food.  
  
Of course, I bought some for Earl and myself as well. The fish is like
saury, and it was delicious with just the right amount of fat. It was
also good served with grated daikon radish and the lemon added a
refreshing touch.  
  
No, no, no. Today's purpose is shopping. It wasn't for a meal.  
  
"No, Niru. That's all for today!"  
  
I also caught Niru as he tried to fly off to another store
(food-related, of course), and moved away from the food stalls.  
  
"Ah, Chloe! There's a lumber shop over here!"  
  
Across the street crowded with stalls and goods, Miranda-san waved from
behind a slightly visible figure in the distance.  
  
"It seems there's lumber over there. Shall we go, Lucille-san…?"  
  
Huh? Lucille-san isn't here again?  
  
"C-Chloe, wait… whap! Don't push! I'll be crushed!!"  
  
When I turned around, I saw Lucille-san being crushed between two
people.  
We had to rescue her. Earl and I pulled her protruding hand, and she
came right out.  
  
"Haah… haah… I had a terrible experience…"  
"Are you alright, Lucille-san?"  
"Somehow… a child's body is inconvenient at times like these."  
  
If she had been swallowed by the crowd, she might have been lost. To
prevent Lucille-san from being crushed again, I decided to hold her
hand.  
  
Miranda-san led us to a lumber stall. Various types of lumber were lined
up.  
  
"There are a lot of different kinds...Trent wood and steel wood are
quite rare."  
  
There really is a lot here. Lucille-san seems knowledgeable and was
explaining the different types to Earl. She said that Trent wood can be
used to make moving furniture, and steel wood is used to create
high-strength items.  
  
"As for what would be good for Chloe's staff... this looks good."  
  
She pointed to a jet-black lumber called \[Obsidian Wood\]. It’s as
black as charcoal, not reflecting any light.  
  
"It's a tree that grows in a place called \[The Jet-Black Forest\]. It
grows by absorbing magical power flowing deep underground, so it's easy
for magical power to circulate, making it popular as material for
staffs. However, if you don't handle it properly, the wood will absorb
your magical power. It's not suitable for beginners who can't yet
control their magical power."  
  
Apparently, the staff made from this lumber requires a \[Two-Handed
Staff\] skill level of 30 or higher. I've already reached that level, so
I can equip it.  
  
"Excuse me, I'll take this \[Obsidian Wood\]."  
"Yes, it's 300,000G."  
"300,000G… eh, 300,000G?"  
  
Isn't that a bit expensive? 300,000G for this wood? Well, its place of
origin is far from here… so I guess it can’t be helped that it's so
expensive. I asked Miranda-san and she said it’s a reasonable price.  
I’ve already cashed in the items I picked up in the dungeon before
coming here. I regained the 1,500,000G that I had spent on buying a
house, so I can afford it.  
I'm also planning to get new accessories and armor… but that'll probably
drain my money quickly again.  
  
"Oh my, isn’t that Chloe-chan and the others."  
"Miranda's group is here too."  
"Oh, there are the old guys! Hi there!"  
"You're Sunny-san and Tetsu-san, right?"  
  
It seems the two chefs who run a skewer and sandwich stall in Dairode
Town are here too.  
  
"Ah, and Nick-san's here as well."  
"…Hey"  
  
Behind them was Nick-san, the unsociable bear of an armorer. I never
expected so many craftsmen from Dairode to be here.  
  
"Tetsu-san and the others came to see the market too?"  
"Yeah. I thought there might be rare spices and recipe books."  
"There's a celebration festival coming up soon. I thought we might find
ideas for new products for the festival here."  
"Celebration festival…?"  
"You don't know, miss? A new lord was just appointed, so they're holding
a festival in Dairode to celebrate."  
  
Oh. Dairode Town has a new lord?  
  
"We're going to have a stall too. It'll be good advertising for our
store."  
"I've just heard something good. It sounds interesting, I might join in
too."  
  
It seems Miranda-san and Oliver-kun are going to have stalls too… Hmm,
perhaps I should participate as well. I was just about to open a shop in
town. Having a stall at the festival would be good advertising.  
In that case, it might be a good idea to think about what to sell.  
  
"That's right, Nick-san. I was planning to come by your store later."  
"…New gear?"  
  
Nick-san seems happy. He's not a very emotional person, but for some
reason, I felt like his tone of voice was slightly higher than usual.  
  
"Are you really that happy to receive orders?"  
"I found just the right material, so I thought I'd use it."  
  
Saying that, Nick-san took out a piece of cloth from his item box. It
feels like wool, soft to the touch.  
  
"It seems to be an import from the Heiss Region. It has a pleasant
texture and good breathability. The fibers are strong, so it offers
higher defense than other fabrics, and its ability to retain magical
power makes it good as clothing for magical professions. It would be
perfect for someone like you, wouldn't it?"  
"Fufu, that's right. Then I can make a piece of armor out of this
fabric… huh?"  
  
There was a band fastened around the rolled cloth to keep it from
spreading out. When I stared at it, an information window appeared.  
  
\[Bradley Viscount Family Crest\]  
  
…Bradley Viscount Family? I feel like I've seen that somewhere
before…?  
Ah...ahh! Isn't this Chloe's family crest!?  
  
"Nick-san, this crest…"  
"It seems to be a mark from the producer. The merchant said something
about a certain noble making it…"  
  
So this is fabric made by Chloe's family…?  
I never knew they were in the wool textile industry. I also asked the
merchant who was selling it, but he didn't know much.  
However, we haven't had any contact until now, so I never expected fate
would bring us together in this way.  
Even though I ran away from home, I’m always thinking about my family,
and now I'm thinking about it more and more... I'd like to go back there
someday. For now, I’ll buy this fabric.  
  
While looking around to see if there was anything else, something caught
my eye. It was a monster material called \[Small Big Snake's Blood\].  
"Lucille-san. Isn't this the material for the \[Child-Turning Potion\]
in that \[Witchcraft\] book?"  
"Well now. I wonder?"  
"...That's mean."  
"If you ask about everything, you won't grow, right? If you can think,
research, and make it yourself with your own power, you might become a
higher-level witch. Consider this a test."  
  
If she says it like that, I can't refuse.  
Alright, fine. I'll make a child-turning potion or two. This is the
first step!  
  
"Thank you very much! That'll be 300,000G!"  
  
Yes, this is a necessary step for becoming a witch. It's a necessary
expense…  
Somehow, this step feels very small, but even small steps eventually
lead to the destination. I'm sure I'm heading in the right direction, so
I'm sure it'll be fine… I’m sure!  
  
Well, that's about it for my shopping. To be honest, if I stay here any
longer, I might spend more, so I should wrap this up.  
  
"Um… how about this shape, Klin?"  
"Yes… that might be good."  
  
Klin-kun and Oliver-kun were standing in front of a stall. It's unusual
to see them together. What’s more, they're in front of an accessory
shop.  
  
"What are you doing?"  
"W-Whoa... Chloe-san..."  
  
Klin-kun was surprised to see me. I don't know why, but now I'm even
more curious.  
  
"It's suspicious for two men to be in front of an accessory shop…"  
"There’s nothing suspicious. Klin wanted to find a gift for Miranda, so
I'm helping him."  
"Um, there's no deep meaning to it! I caused her so much worry during
the Iru incident… I wanted to give a gift to show my gratitude…"  
  
So that's how it is. How heartwarming. That's why he was surprised when
I spoke to him earlier. He probably thought I was with Miranda-san.  
  
"Honestly, I told him he should ask you, who's a woman, instead of
someone like me."  
"Well, but... it's a gift for a woman, like the manager, so..."  
"I'm a woman too, you know, Klin-kun?"  
"Ah, no! It's not like that! I just thought that since Chloe-san is
close to the manager, she might say something… ! Sunny-san and the
others seem busy with trades, and Oliver-san is the only one I could
rely on! He's a craftsman, too!"  
  
Am I really lacking in femininity, Kyle-san? I’ll need to work on that a
bit more.  
  
"There's no way I'd talk about it. Well, whatever it is, I'll help."  
  
So, along with Oliver-kun, I helped Klin-kun choose a gift. However,
since Oliver-kun said he would be making the gift himself, we decided to
just look at the items at the stalls as a reference.  
In the end, Klin-kun decided on a hair ornament shaped like a lily.
Apparently, lilies are Miranda-san's favorite flower. Unlike necklaces
and rings, it doesn't have a heavy meaning, and it shouldn’t get in the
way of her work, so he chose a hair accessory.  
  
"Kyaaaah!"  
"Hey, what are you doing!?"  
  
What is it? Suddenly, a scream came from across the street, and people
started running away.  
  
"That's…"  
  
A man was rampaging among the fleeing people. His unfocused eyes were
blood red. Ah, this is probably…  
  
"Chloe!"  
"Yes, I know!"  
  
Responding to Lucille-san's voice, I threw a potion containing lake
water at the man. The man, cleansed by the potion, immediately calmed
down and collapsed as if fainting.  
  
"This guy… seems to have been affected by Chaos."  
"It seems so. But why?"  
  
I immediately looked around on alert, but there's no sign of them. But
where there's Chaos, there's a red shadow. They're probably involved
somehow.  
  
"Where… am I…?"  
"Are you alright? May I ask you a few questions?"  
  
The man who regained consciousness looked around nervously.  
  
"Do you remember how this happened?"  
"Um… ah, that's right, medicine. Someone said there was medicine that
would make me stronger, so I just bought it."  
"...So you tried it and it turned out like this. Who did you buy it
from?"  
"I don't remember well… it was a typical merchant who was around
here."  
  
It seems I won’t be able to get any more information. Security guards
who had heard the commotion arrived, so we left.  
  
"Hey, Chloe. What was that just now…"  
"It appears to be a case of Chaos causing him to go berserk. It seems he
became like that after buying medicine from a merchant."  
"...Unforgivable. Let's track down that merchant!"  
  
Miranda-san's anger is justified. We can't let a merchant selling
dangerous drugs go free. If we catch him, we might get information
leading to that group.  
  
So, we searched for the medicine merchant in the market, but couldn't
find him. Well, it was right after the commotion. I doubt he'd stick
around.  
  
So, we had no choice but to withdraw for now. We'll investigate again
later.
