# 103・Beware of Getting Caught Up in Things

The Iru Underground Mine. These are tunnels that have been dug
underground for decades. With Oliver-kun's guidance, we walked to the
entrance where the dungeon was.  
  
The tunnels were well-maintained by humans and dwarves, but due to the
appearance of Willamedes, parts had collapsed in places. Some paths were
completely blocked.  
  
“One of those paths led to the lowest level. That area yielded
high-quality and rare ores… but after Willamedes was sealed, we couldn't
mine them, and now the path is blocked. So I thought we wouldn't see
those ores until we reopened the path…”  
  
Although the path was blocked, new caves and veins have appeared due to
tectonic shifts. The dungeon in question is one of them.  
  
“Rumor has it that the dungeon yields rare ores that you’d never
normally expect to see. We have to go, don't we?”  
  
Oliver-kun grinned, his craftsman's spirit ignited. He seems quite
excited about the prospect of finding undiscovered ores.  
  
The dungeon entrance is near the middle level. Usually only miners are
present there, but now many players are gathered. Some of them are even
doing business. I wish I had brought more potions.  
  
“Oh, are you guys tackling the dungeon too?”  
  
Turning to the voice, there was a conspicuous group in golden attire—El
Dorado. Kogane-san was waving at us from the center. Next to her, of
course, were Rush-san and Friday-san.  
  
“Yes. I’m following Kogane-san’s advice.”  
“Glad it helped. Hmm, you’re quite a team—wait, isn't that Oliver?”  
“It’s nice to see you, Kogane-san. Always appreciate your patronage.”  
“What’s this? If you wanted to go to the dungeon, you should’ve asked! I
would’ve taken you…”  
“There were some circumstances this time. I decided to ask for their
help.”  
  
Come to think of it, the El Dorado clan was Oliver-kun's client, wasn't
it? Oliver-kun glanced toward Azi-chan and the others, looking a little
embarrassed. As for us, our relationship last time involved catching and
being caught.  
  
“Are you guys heading in too?”  
“Of course, we’re planning to go and conquer it. Apparently, the full
layout hasn't been revealed yet. We'll be the ones to uncover it!”  
  
Kogane-san smiled broadly in response to Oliver-kun.  
  
“Well then, you guys do your best too!"  
  
Kogane-san led Rush-san and the others towards the dungeon entrance.  
  
“Alright, let’s go!”  
“Yeah! Let's do our best, everyone!"  
  
Light-kun and Azi-chan were energized. We also decided to enter the
dungeon.  
The entrance to the dungeon is a large fissure that appeared suddenly
within the well-maintained tunnel. Beyond the fissure is a massive
double door that’s so tall you have to look up. A monster-like creature
was carved into the white door. It was wide open, and people were
entering one after another.  
  
However, those who entered soon became hazy and disappeared. Taking even
one step beyond the door transported you to a separate space cut off
from the outside world. There, a labyrinth awaits, with different
appearances depending on the group.  
  
Simply put, it’s an instance dungeon with randomly generated floors. The
inside of the dungeon is also made to fit a single party, so you won’t
encounter other parties.  
  
*‘…Hmm, it's quite an old ruin. It looks like it's from the Calamity
Era. These types of ruins have defensive magic, so be careful.’*  
  
Lucille-san murmured while observing the door. This is apparently her
assessment of the dungeon.  
  
What awaits us beyond this point? With a mix of anxiety and excitement,
we followed the disappearing figures through the door.  
  
  
  
Passing through the door, we found ourselves in a corridor with stone
walls, unlike the exposed bare rock surface of the previous tunnel.
Looking back, the tunnel entrance is still visible. There were people
outside, but we couldn't hear any noise. It was as if a barrier
separated us. The people on the other side probably can’t see us.  
  
There’s no light in the hallway and it was dark and I couldn't see
ahead. But suddenly, a light appeared and it became bright. It seems
that someone cast the light spell.  
  
“Light-kun used a Light spell.”  
“Stop with the jokes.”  
  
I made eye contact with Light-kun, who seemed a little regretful about
giving his character the same name as the magic spell.  
Kyle-san and Bluey-kun also cast the light spell \[Light\], so the
darkness problem was solved. …As a dark magic user, I didn’t mind it
that way, though. I moved a little to get away from the light.  
  
"Well then, let's get going!"  
"Wait, I'll cast a support spell first."  
  
Saval-kun stopped Light-kun, who was about to start walking away. It's
better to cast long-lasting support magic beforehand to avoid
forgetting.  
  
Bluey-kun cast support magic on us. The holy magic, \[Mana Shield\]. It
creates a magical shield around the target, weakening the power of any
attack. I wonder if that's why my attacks didn't go through so well when
we fought before. And then there's \[Protection\]. It's a spell that
completely blocks attacks once.  
  
“Sylph, spirit of the wind. Reveal your true form as per the contract
and grant us your protection!"  
  
What Saval-kun chanted was a summoning spirit spell. The Sylph that
appeared circled above us. As glittering light fell, we received
\[Sylph's Blessing\]. The effects include a 30% movement speed increase,
and increased wind attribute effectiveness and resistance. It also
reduces damage from falls from high places.  
  
I could also achieve increased movement speed with \[Wind Step\], but
this spell is more effective. A testament to the power of spirit magic.
Afterward, the Sylph disappeared in a light, just as it had appeared
when it was summoned. Spirit magic involves summoning spirits for their
help. Once they lend their power, the spirits disappear immediately,
meaning a user can’t constantly summon them.  
  
“You can use spirit magic?”  
"I only just signed a contract the other day."  
  
Apparently, contracting a spirit is quite difficult. For other types of
summoning, such as Summoner and Familiar, even ordinary monsters will
suffice, but Spirits require meeting a spirit first before any contract
gets made. Even if you do meet one, whether or not they’ll make a
contract is another matter entirely. Saval-kun had encountered a fire
spirit before, but its compatibility with the forest elves was poor, so
he couldn’t make a contract.  
  
“Anyone else with support magic?”  
  
Well, I have a support magic that I can use... This one looks good. I
cast the earth magic, \[Earth's Blessing\], which I recently learned. It
increases the target's defense.  
  
“I also have a spell called \[Black Mark\] that increases attack power
at the cost of defense. Do you need it?"  
“Why would we lower our defense you just worked so hard to raise? We
don't need it now.”  
“I understand, Saval-kun. I just wanted to check.”  
  
\[Black Mark\] is a dark magic skill that gives power in exchange for a
drawback. I wanted to use it, but… well, I'll try using it when the time
comes.  
  
  
  
We moved deeper into the dungeon. The formation is Azi-chan and
Sazanka-san in the lead as scouts. Next is Kyle-san and Light-kun.
Following behind me is Bluey-kun, Oliver-kun, and finally Saval-kun.  
  
“There's a trap there. Be careful.”  
  
A report came in from Tsuba... no, Sazanka-san, one of the scouts ahead
of us. They seem to have found a trap before encountering enemies.  
  
“Amazing! I didn't notice that at all… Is Sazanka-san’s level really
that high?”  
“No, I also saw it, you just missed it, Azi!”  
“Seriously!?”  
  
Please pull yourself together, Azi-chan… I’m glad that Sazanka-san is
our scout. Niru’s \[Perception\] skill allows me to detect traps as
well. However, I can’t disarm them.  
  
“L-Let me disarm it! I’m good at it!”  
"Yes, please do."  
  
Saval-kun sighed beside me. This seems to be his daily routine. I could
sense the hardships he endures every day. After disarming the trap, we
moved forward when the two ahead stopped.  
  
“Enemies ahead!”  
“Five Stone Golems. They haven’t noticed us yet.”  
  
I couldn’t see the enemy well from here. All I can see is a white
figure. It looks somewhat like the golems I can summon.  
  
“Can we surprise attack?”  
“We can.”  
“Yeah, I think so. And Saval, you can too, right?”  
“Yes. Leave it to me.”  
“Then, if we launch a surprise attack, Light and I will go forward.
Chloe and the others, you guys provide rear support.”  
  
With Kyle-san’s words as the signal, the two scouts disappeared.  
  
It’s the stealth skill \[Stealth\]. The two vanished completely.
…Azi-chan disappeared as if melting into the darkness, while Sazanka-san
was enveloped in white smoke and disappeared in an instant.  
  
Even though it's the same skill, the visual effects are different. It
seems Sazanka-san has customized the skill.  
  
I didn't have time to be impressed. The surprise attack on the golems
began immediately.  
  
Sazanka-san’s attack targeted a weak point, instantly killing the golem.
She works fast.  
  
Azi-chan used \[Guard Break\] to lower their defense before delivering a
succession of attacks with her twin daggers.  
  
Saval-kun’s arrow struck the third golem. The HP bar decreased
drastically… Ah, that must have been a critical hit from attacking its
weak point, the core.  
Kyle-san and Light-kun immediately stepped forward to assist. The two
weakened golems fell without resistance.  
  
The remaining two were…  
  
“Now, be consumed by darkness!”  
  
I cast \[Dark Burst\]. The two were engulfed in a dark explosion.
Although they didn’t die instantly, they were almost dead. Too bad.  
  
“Hey, don’t drag me into it!”  
“Oh, sorry, Light-kun.”  
  
Light-kun seemed to have been caught in the blast radius. He didn’t take
any magic damage, but was blown away along with the golems.  
  
I went to help Light-kun get up, who had been sent flying. Meanwhile,
Kyle-san and Sazanka-san dealt with the fallen golems.  
  
“Don’t use that move next time.”  
“But that’s my most powerful technique…”  
“Even if it’s powerful, you didn’t kill them! Don’t blow the enemy away
in that state!”  
  
…It's true that the golems flew a little far. Even though it’s a stone
corridor surrounded by walls, it’s wide enough for ten people to walk
through side by side. Therefore, if they're thrown carelessly, they
could fly far away. Needless to say, there’s a place at the end of the
passage.  
  
“Understood. Next time, I’ll use a move that kills them for sure.”  
"No, that's not what I meant..."  
“Of course, I’ll be careful not to get anyone involved. That’s fine,
right?”  
  
I smiled, and he gave me a slightly stiff smile in return, but he seemed
to understand. It’s okay; I won’t carelessly blow things up anymore.  
  
Well, I was able to get the golem's dropped items. Hmm……  
  
“Junk ore, junk ore… cracked core…”  
“Can you really find gems here? At this level, wouldn't it be better to
hunt monsters outside?"  
  
They were mostly useless items. Light-kun said the same thing.  
  
“These are typical drops in this area. If you want rare drops, it’s
better to go to the lower levels.”  
  
Oliver-kun replied while holding a piece of junk ore. It's only the
first battle. Let's look forward to what's to come.
