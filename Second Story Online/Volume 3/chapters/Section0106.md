# 106・Beyond the Fall

After taking a short break in the dilapidated dining hall, we continued
our journey through the labyrinth. We fought our way through similar
corridors, defeating enemies until reaching the sixth floor.  
We were able to proceed without any major incidents, probably because we
took breaks. Everyone was moving efficiently. This is also thanks to
Sazanka-san, who found the room for us. Though, everyone almost died
from that soup earlier.  
  
"...There's another trap there."  
  
We stopped in our tracks at the words we had heard many times today. The
hallway that stretched out before us looked empty.  
  
"It looks like the trap this time is a pitfall."  
“Either way, I'll just disarm it!”  
“Wait, Azi! Don’t disarm it yet!”  
  
It was Saval-kun who stopped Azi-chan as she was about to disarm the
trap.  
  
“What? We can’t go any further without disarming it, right?”  
“No, that’s not necessarily true. This maze goes underground. If we fall
into the pitfall, we might go directly to the floor below.”  
“Oh, that’s right! You’re right!”  
  
Indeed, instead of using stairs, falling into a pitfall could take us
down a floor. According to Saval-kun, it could even take us down two or
more floors, making it a shortcut.  
  
“But, won't we take fall damage…?”  
“That’s not a problem, we have the \[Sylph's Protection\], right?”  
  
Saval-kun answered Light-kun’s concerns. Come to think of it, the
protection’s effect included fall damage reduction. Then, even if we
fall from a high place, it should be alright to some extent.  
  
“But, we don’t know how high it is…”  
“If you’re that worried, why don’t I just try and fall and see how high
it is? I can fly.”  
  
Saying that, I picked up my broom. I didn't think I'd need it in this
narrow labyrinth, but it always comes in handy in unexpected places.  
  
“I'll go and check if it's safe. If it’s not, I’ll fly back.”  
“Then we’ll leave it to Chloe. Don’t push yourself.”  
  
With Kyle-san’s caution, I approached the trap. Niru and Lucille-san
followed me. I considered sending Niru, but it seems that familiars
can’t trigger traps. The same goes for pets. Too bad.  
  
——\*Thud!\*  
  
The moment I stepped into the trap, the ground disappeared instantly.
Only unseen darkness lay beneath my feet. After a brief moment of
floating, my body fell into the pit. …If I used dark magic here, would
it be at maximum power?  
  
Even though I’m not worried about falling to my death, I don’t have time
for such idle thoughts. However, this fall is surprisingly long. If it
were just one floor, it shouldn't be that long… but this is two, three
floors?  
  
Finally, I can see light. Well, the free fall is over. It's time to fly
on the broom. Flying through the darkness, I reached the underground
floor.  
  
“I’ve arrived.”  
*‘Chloe, how’s it looking over there?’*  
“Well, it seems to be quite a large room.”  
  
I replied to Kyle-san’s communication while landing and looking around.
Unlike the complete darkness before, it’s only dimly lit, but it would
be hard to see without light. I have night vision, so it's not a problem
for me.  
  
——\*Thud!\*  
  
“Eh…”  
  
A loud sound came from above. Thinking it might be that, I looked up at
the ceiling. …As I suspected. The hole I fell through was gone. It seems
the pitfall was one-way.  
  
“The hole’s closed, and we can’t go back up.”  
*‘What?!’*  
“Well, other than not being able to go back, there are no problems— ”  
“Chloe, behind you!”  
  
Lucille-san’s sharp voice. Through her \[Presence Detection\] skill, a
red effect indicating danger appeared on my screen. The moment I
realized something was wrong, I was grabbed by a large hand.  
  
In the darkness, I could see something larger than the golems we fought
earlier. \[Giant Guardian Golem\]… it even has a unique title. And
looking around, there are several \[Iron Golems\], and a variant of the
Stone Roller with various gems on its back, the \[Crystal Roller\].  
  
“It seems this is… a monster house.”  
  
The end of the pitfall is a monster house. A great double trap to repel
intruders.  
While I was admiring this, the hand tightening around me broke through
my \[Protection\] shield, and my health started decreasing. Since I’m
restrained, I can’t escape or use magic.  
  
It's a bad situation, but I couldn't do anything—  
  
——\*Thud!\*  
  
Just then. A sound came from above again, and a white mass fell from
above the golem that was grabbing me. A heavy sound like something hard
colliding with something else echoed, and the golem loosened its grip
due to the impact. I escaped from the restraint and put some distance
between us.  
  
“Chloe, are you alright!”  
“Yes. I’m okay thanks to you, Kyle-san.”  
  
I saw Kyle-san kicking the golem's head and landing on the ground, his
shield raised to protect me. He came to save me by jumping into the
pitfall right away. He seems to have fallen shield-down, so he didn't
take any fall damage. In fact, he even managed to deal damage to the
golem.  
  
“Whew… both of you seem to be alright!”  
“We’ll keep the other enemies occupied for the time being. I’ll leave
the big ones to Kyle-dono.”  
  
Azi-chan and Sazanka-san came down without a sound. When they fell, they
were already defeating enemies with their respective weapons. They work
fast. They continued to fight the other enemies.  
  
“I’m sorry for putting you in danger because of my suggestion.”  
“Well, I didn’t expect the hole to close, so it can’t be helped.”  
  
Next, Saval-kun, and Bluey-kun, who he was carrying, came down.
Saval-kun went to support the two who had gone to the front lines, while
Bluey-kun treated my injuries.  
  
“Uwaaaaaaaa! Ouch! I messed up my landing!”  
*‘…Shouldn't you have been carried by Saval too?’*  
“Shut up! I just misjudged the angle a little!”  
  
Light-kun came down—or rather, plummeted down—while screaming.
Oliver-kun, who seemed to have chosen to wait above, made a cold remark.
…No damage. His protection was broken though.  
  
“Light! Quickly help me over here, I can’t hold it off alone!”  
“Sorry! I’m coming!”  
  
Light-kun went to support Kyle-san, who was withstanding the attack of a
Giant Golem alone.  
  
“The analysis is complete, and that golem has no magic resistance."  
“Thanks for the report, Bluey. You can see the Giant Golem’s weak point,
right? I'll leave the rest to you."  
“Yes, I understand.”  
  
I nodded in response to Saval-kun’s words. —Alright, let’s do this.  
Kyle-san and Light-kun were facing the Giant Golem. Azi-chan and
Sazanka-san were taking care of the surrounding enemies so as to not get
in the way.  
Saval-kun shot down any enemies that the two couldn't handle, or any
that were coming towards us. Bluey-kun immediately healed anyone who got
injured.  
  
So, what is my role? It is, of course, dealing damage with magic.  
  
"Oh, 《Power of Darkness》…"  
  
A purple magic circle appears in response to the activation words of the
set skill. A ten-second incantation is not necessary. Everyone else is
holding back the enemies. I drank dark soup and a cold medicine just
before to lower and then raise my stats… the rest is just casting.  
  
“Now, this is my payback! Blow everything away, Dark Burst!”  
  
A dark explosion erupted centered on the Giant Golem. The magic hit the
most fragile part of its seemingly flawless, solid body. The
black-purple flames shattered its body into pieces. Not only that, but
it also blew away the surrounding enemies.  
  
“…As always, the damage is amazing.”  
“The person using it almost died, though. It’s practically a suicide
attack.”  
  
I heard Saval-kun’s exasperated voice. But this much is fine. I managed
to wipe out all the enemies in the area, including the Giant Golem.  
Ah, thank you for the healing Bluey-kun. This is certainly a suicide
technique. The greater the cost, the greater the power, so I can’t say
anything.  
  
“I told you not to drag me into this aaaaaaaa!”  
  
…I might've heard something from the still-raging magical explosion, but
it’s probably just my imagination. After all, Kyle-san, Azi-chan, and
Sazanka-san, who were in the same area, weren't caught in it.  
  
*‘Oh, is it over? I’m glad it worked out.’*  
  
I can hear Oliver-kun’s relaxed voice from above. Yes, I'm really glad
that everything turned out fine.
