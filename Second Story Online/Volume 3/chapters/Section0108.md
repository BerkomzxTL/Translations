# 108・What Is Your Path?

"Whew, finally finished!"  
Light-kun stretched, looking exhausted. Having defeated the boss, the
dungeon is considered cleared. We used the escape portal leading to the
surface and returned to the dungeon entrance.  
  
"I was expecting to be able to loot something from the big boss, but I
couldn't get anything…"  
"That's only possible with the lumpy Stone Rollers, right?"  
"Ah, right, that's right."  
  
Oliver-kun sighed wearily in response to Light-kun.  
Indeed, we couldn't get any additional loot from the boss. However, the
dropped items weren't bad. I even got a golem core and an amethyst.
There are other things I don't think I'll be able to use, but I could
probably make some money selling them.  
  
"All right! That was a good time, right?!"  
"Yes, it was a pretty good time."  
"With this, we'll get first… wait, Chloe and the others are here? Did
they already clear it?"  
  
Oh, it seems Kogane-san and the others seem to have finished clearing
the dungeon as well. They seem to think they were the fastest to clear
it and come out. But unfortunately, the credit for clearing the dungeon
the fastest went to our party.  
  
"Seriously?! I thought we were number one!"  
"Hmm. From what I hear, their boss battle strategy was quick. They must
have cleared it by boosting the power of dark magic…"  
"Friday, I'm sure there was a kid who knew dark magic, right? Let's
bring that guy and go again."  
"If it's like usual, they'll log in soon. The only thing we're missing
is…"  
  
Kogane-san and the others started strategizing their next dungeon run on
the spot. ...Unfortunately, it looks like the fastest clear position
will soon be snatched away.  
  
And so, after congratulating each other on our efforts, our party
disbanded.  
Now then. I could log out for today, but… there's one thing that's
bothering me.  
  
"Thank you for your hard work, Sazanka-san. Or should I call you
Tsubaki-san?"  
  
After we broke up. I ran after her as she was about to disappear into
the crowd and called out to her. Because it was crowded, the area was
noisy. But my voice must have reached her clearly. She stopped and
turned around.  
  
"……You noticed, did you?"  
"Yes, don't think you can fool my eyes."  
"As expected of Chloe-dono. I still have a long way to go."  
  
It was obvious, wasn't it? If she hadn't brought Haku with her, I might
not have noticed, but still. From her reaction, it seems like she really
thought I hadn't noticed. I won't say anything here. I can't believe
there was nobody else who noticed besides me.  
  
"So, what do you want from me? If it's revenge for last time, I'll take
you on."  
"I'd love to, but… I have something I'd like to ask you."  
  
We left the crowd for a less crowded area. Tsubaki-san, having taken off
her hood to reveal her face, is looking at me. Her crimson eyes are
cold, despite their color, and her expression is unreadable.  
  
"Why are you here?"  
"…………"  
  
She remained silent, refusing to answer. If you ask her directly,
there's no way she'll answer, so this response was predictable. Let's
act like I’m shrugging my shoulders in exasperation.  
There's no way she's here for no reason. It's probably related to the
previous incident.  
Maybe she's here to erase some evidence that shouldn't be left behind?
It seems like the Red Hood gang has been operating out of this town for
a long time.  
Well, this is just my guess. I don't know the truth, and she probably
won't tell me.  
  
"I'm curious as to why you're here… but that's not the point now. Why
did you join our party?"  
"……That's"  
"Why are you so quiet?"  
"…………"  
"It's not because of a mission, is it? This is surely your own personal
action."  
  
If the purpose was to enter the dungeon, she didn't have to be in the
same party as us.  
Moreover, Tsubaki-san joined our party last. She could have avoided
joining just by checking the members.  
She's the one who stole the hero Light-kun's sword and killed me. It's
strange that she'd join the party knowing that she'd be in trouble if
her identity were revealed.  
  
"…Did you enjoy conquering the dungeon?"  
"Why are you asking that?"  
"It was fun conquering it together with us, wasn't it?"  
"It wasn't like that…!"  
"Tsubaki-san. You're different from those guys in red hoods… You stole
Light-kun's sword, but you could have done it immediately. Yet you took
it after we defeated the red beast. You helped save Lucille-san."  
"It was more convenient that way…"  
"...Let's stop with the excuses. Tsubaki-san. You're a kind person at
heart. And you wanted to adventure with us so much that you even
pretended to be someone else to be our companion."  
  
Tsubaki-san was wearing a hood in the dungeon, so I couldn't read her
expressions well. But I still think she looked very happy… Maybe her
true self showed through a little, but I can't say that's all there is
to it, considering her character.  
  
She looked away from me and bowed her head. Haku was flying beside her,
nuzzling Tsubaki-san worriedly.  
  
"…I've lived my whole life for the sake of my missions. That's my role,
and I thought that's all I would do… without ever questioning it. But,
that time. When I helped save Lucille-dono with Chloe-dono and the
others, I learned for the first time that I could also save people.
…So"  
"So?"  
"……So I started to question things for the first time. Whether I only
have the ability to carry out orders. Even when I killed Chloe-dono that
time, I felt that way…"  
  
You didn't hesitate to kill me, though? I'll keep that to myself. I
wouldn't say that in such a serious moment. I'll hide my true feelings
(my real words) and speak as Chloe.  
  
"You came to our party because you wanted to know the answer to that
question. Have you found the answer?"  
"Not yet…"  
"I see. –Then what will you do from now on?"  
"……From now on?"  
"Will you continue your missions without finding an answer? I think that
will be even more painful. Because you've adventured with us once. You
must have thought it was very enjoyable, didn't you? …If you return to
the same path again, you’ll stand against us. You’ll be my enemy too.
You could become friends again as Sazanka, but can you do the same thing
again?"  
  
As Sazanka, she made friends she could call companions.  
But the next time we meet, it will surely be Tsubaki, loyal to her
mission.  
It would be painful to repeat the same thing again after that. After
all, Tsubaki-san has a conscience. If she keeps this relationship up
while deceiving us, what will happen to her heart… it's obvious.  
  
"Then… what should I do? What should I do?"  
"It's simple. Just quit your mission and wash your hands of it."  
"……You say it so easily! You wouldn't understand how nice it would be if
it were easy!"  
  
She shouted loudly, rejecting me. But, that cry from the heart also
sounded like a plea for help. In fact, Tsubaki-san looked like she was
about to burst into tears.  
  
"Yes, I don't know. But I can lend a hand. Make it easier for you."  
"…Are you sure you can accept that so easily?"  
"Of course, I'm not helping you for free. It's in our best interest if
you stopped cooperating with them."  
  
I don't know how much influence Tsubaki-san has among the red hoods… but
I think it would give us a slight advantage. Even if her influence is
minimal, it's good if we can get Tsubaki-san on our side. It's always
better to have more allies.  
  
"……I see. A deal, is it?"  
"I'm glad you agree. It's a mutually beneficial deal, isn't it?"  
  
Ah, but….  
  
"It's true that I want to do something for you. …I haven't forgotten.
What happened in the Twilight Forest, you know? I consider you one of my
few friends."  
  
This is purely as a friend. For Chloe, this is the first friend she's
made here.  
  
"Chloe-dono… …A friend. I never thought I would have such a person in my
life…”  
  
Considering her character's position and circumstances, it's quite
difficult to make friends….  
…Oops, that's not something to think about right now. Sorry.  
But my words seemed to reach Tsubaki-san's heart. Yep, it went well.  
  
"I would like to respond to the words of a friend who says that… but… I
need some time to think."  
"Yes, I'll be waiting for your answer anytime, Tsubaki-san."  
  
With that, Tsubaki-san turned to leave—  
  
"Oh, that's right, Tsubaki-san"  
"……Something else—"  
  
Tsubaki-san was about to say something, but she never finished her
sentence.  
Why? Because, of course, my attack hit her and blew her HP away.  
  
"You said you'd accept my revenge, right?"  
"S-Such a surprise attack is cowardly…"  
"Oh, are you one to say that? You're the one who killed me from
behind."  
  
I thought I should repay my debts properly.  
And she might become a companion in the future. Wouldn't it be best to
leave things without any regrets?  
  
"I'll see you again, Tsubaki-san."  
  
I waved goodbye as I saw off Tsubaki-san, who disappeared as a corpse.  
She disappeared with a smile, so I'm sure she'll be okay.
