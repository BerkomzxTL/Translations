# 115・Celebration Festival

"To the new lord!"  
"Cheers!!"  
  
The sound of mugs clinking together could be heard from all around,
accompanying the cheers.  
A large festival was being held for the first time in Dairode Town; a
celebratory festival honoring the new lord. Every time new players join,
the town becomes lively, but this feels even more bustling than usual.  
It’s not just filled with beginners either. I can see some intermediate
players who seemed to have already left this area.  
  
"It's really crowded…"  
"It really is~! That's why we have to work hard at promoting our goods
during times like these~!"  
  
Miranda-san, whose stall was next to mine, was already calling out to
passersby.  
  
"By the way, Chloe-chan, you're wearing a beautiful dress today~! Did
you get new equipment?"  
"Yes, that's right."  
  
Saying that, I twirled around to show it off.  
  
"Wow! It suits you perfectly, Chloe-chan! It's adorable~!"  
"Thank you. Miranda-san, that hair ornament suits you too."  
"Ehehe, thanks~! Klin gave it to me~"  
  
The lily hair ornament, which held her soft hair in place, suited her
well. It seems the hair ornament I helped him choose earlier was
successfully gifted to Miranda-san.  
  
"Ah~ festivals are wonderful things!"  
"Tetsu-san, you're drinking quite heartily again."  
  
Across from me was Tetsu-san's skewered meat stall. The owner was
currently drinking sake at a table placed in the street.  
  
"Of course! During festivals, you drink, eat, and make merry! This game
is great. You can drink and eat as much as you want."  
  
He drank from a large tankard of sake, then proceeded to eat the meat
skewers he was holding. …Wait, isn't that meat for sale…?  
  
"It's a shame I can't get drunk."  
  
Of course, this is a game after all. Even if you drink something called
sake, you can enjoy the same taste, but you won’t get drunk.  
You can drink as much as you want without ever becoming completely
drunk. That's a good thing, perhaps, but it’s not ideal when you want to
get drunk. The exhilarating feeling you get when you're drunk can only
be experienced in reality.  
  
But… Tetsu-san looks like he's drunk right now. People can get
intoxicated by the atmosphere of an event, so that must be it.  
  
"But you can't just drink and eat all day! You need to do your work
properly."  
"I know, I know. My meat skewers go well with sake! Now then, you there,
young man! I've prepared a new flavor just for this festival!"  
  
Even though Sunny-san scolded him a little, Tetsu-san went back to his
stall to grill skewers. …Even though it’s not real, the aroma is so
delicious it makes me want to eat some.  
  
"No, Niru. We have to tend the store too."  
  
I held back Niru from grabbing some. I'll buy him some later.  
While soothing the dissatisfied Niru, I checked for any problems with my
store's merchandise. Good, there seem to be no issues.  
  
"New opening in Dairode Town: \[Twilight House\]! Thank you for your
patronage!"  
  
With a swish of her dress, the signboard cat girl was calling customers
to my stall. …Ah, Lucille-san.  
Lucille-san, we're taking full advantage of your cute appearance. Thanks
to you, we're able to attract a lot of customers. Our store has been
doing surprisingly well. Well, there's another reason for this
though...  
  
"Ah, there it is, the Twilight House! So you were here."  
"Oh, Oliver-kun. Welcome."  
  
"Yo!" Oliver-kun waved. By the way, I named my shop \[Twilight House\],
after the Twilight Forest. Oliver-kun also has a stall, but it’s quite
far from ours. He seems to have come to check on our situation.  
  
"How's business?"  
"Unfortunately, the sales of medicine are rather inconsistent."  
  
I figured that since the medicines on display are all pretty common,
they wouldn't sell all that well. But because their effects are better
than average, it seems they have a good reputation… though if I were to
sell an all-purpose potion, it might be different. It’s a bit difficult
to sell those, though.  
  
Oliver-kun looked surprised and confused after hearing my response.  
  
"Wait, this isn't a cake shop?"  
"It's a pharmacy… Although we do sell cakes."  
  
Oliver-kun, I understand your misunderstanding. After all, our
top-selling item isn't medicine, it's cake.  
Earl's Blue Rose cakes sell exceptionally well.  
He's still frantically making new cakes behind the scenes. So most of
the customers here come to buy cakes. It's no wonder people mistake it
for a cake shop.  
  
"I came here because I heard about this delicious cake shop from the
bulletin board… but it's a pharmacy?"  
"Could you not laugh?"  
  
Is it really that popular on the bulletin board?? While ignoring
Oliver-kun, who was stifling a laugh, I decided to check it out, since I
was a little curious.  
  
《Recommended shops at the festival! The Blue Rose cake is perfect for
photos! Cake shop \[Twilight House\]. Look for the cute cat girl,
Belcy-chan!》  
  
Certainly, our shop name was indeed listed. As a cake shop. Actually,
even Lucille-san is mentioned! Which means I am too…?  
  
《The owner is the Grass Witch》  
  
"Who's the Grass Witch?! Who is it?!"  
  
Who is it that wrote this! Can I sue them for defamation?  
I couldn't help but cry out, surprising Oliver-kun and the people around
me.  
  
"Whoa whoa, what's wrong? Why are you shouting so loudly…"  
"Excuse me… wait, aren’t you Rush-san?"  
  
When I turned around, I saw Rush-san, who was easy to spot even in this
crowd, wearing golden armor.  
  
"Were you also curious about the festival, Rush-san?"  
"W-well, yeah. I came because Oliver told me he was setting up shop
here."  
"Huh? You actually came to my shop?"  
"What, is there something wrong with that?"  
  
What is this? Rush-san seems rather uncharacteristically restless. As
Oliver-kun said, it’s unusual for him to be alone. He isn't with
Friday-san, Kogane-san, or anyone from the guild for that matter.  
  
"Ah! Rush-kun~! Hey there~!"  
  
Miranda-san from the stall next door seemed to notice him and came over,
waving.  
  
"Hey Miranda, you set up a stall too, huh?"  
"That’s right~ Since you’re here, want to go and check it out?"  
"Ah."  
  
Rush-san was about to follow Miranda-san towards the stall, but he
stopped, seemingly realizing something.  
  
"Miranda… what’s with that hair ornament?"  
"Klin gave it to me~"  
"I see… it suits you well."  
"Thanks!"  
  
Rush-san looked somewhat relieved. Oh my?  
  
"Well, well, if it isn't Rush-san. Welcome."  
  
While Miranda-san and Rush-san were talking, Klin-kun, who should have
been manning the shop, came.  
  
"Manager, please leave him to me. In the meantime, can I ask you to
attend to the customers over there?"  
"Really? Then, Klin, I'll leave it to you~"  
"W-wait, just a moment—"  
  
Leaving Rush-san in a fluster, Miranda-san went off to help another
customer.  
  
"You, you did that on purpose."  
"And what might that mean?"  
  
Undaunted by Rush-san's glare, Klin-kun gave him a pleasant smile.
Sparks seemed to be flying between the two of them.  
  
"Ah, I see. So that’s what he's after."  
"Seems that way."  
  
Along with Oliver-kun, who had a mischievous smile, I watched Rush-san's
dejected back. I don't know how his love life will turn out, but it
seems like it’ll be difficult unless Klin-kun accepts him.  
  
  
"Earl, it's good that we're selling so many cakes, but how about we go
enjoy the festival?"  
  
I called out to Earl, who had come to replenish the cakes for what felt
like the umpteenth time.  
Even though we’re participating as vendors, we have a right to enjoy the
festival too. Besides, Earl must be tired by now. I invited him as a way
for him to take a break.  
  
"And Niru's about to reach his limit."  
  
Niru was crouching behind the shop with a dead look in his eyes. With
Tetsu-san's skewered meat stall and our cake shop right there, it must
be hellish for him to be unable to eat anything.  
  
"Then I'll take care of the shop."  
"Then please. We'll be back in about an hour."  
  
Lucille-san, who was calling out to customers on the street, came back,
so I left the shop to her. I'll give Lucille-san a break later when we
come back.  
Even the familiar Dairode Town, with so many people and shops lined up,
feels completely different. The town is decorated with magical lights,
making it look like an illumination, and just looking at it is fun.  
  
"Wait, Niru!"  
  
Immediately... Niru rushed towards the first food stall he saw. What
now? He’s gone for corn dogs, pizza, candy apples, churros, grilled
corn, popcorn, ice cream…  
  
"That's too much!!"  
  
If he eats that much, he'll get too fat to fly! Ah, but a round and
chubby Niru might be cute in its own way… No, it's nothing.  
Can he even eat all of that…? Well, I guess it's possible for Niru.  
  
"No. I can't buy that much!"  
  
Don't look at me with those teary eyes. What should I do… ? Um? What is
it, Earl?  
  
"Now then, let's begin the hot dog eating contest! Any challengers?
Now's your chance to step up!"  
"Niru, rejoice. You can have your fill now, okay?"  
  
When I smiled at Niru, he glared at me with a dirty look that seemed to
say that it wasn't true.  
As a gourmand, Niru probably wants to savor various dishes slowly, but
devouring a pile of hot dogs quickly wasn't so bad apparently.  
  
"And the winner is Niru! Amazing! I never imagined that even a familiar,
a monster, would win!!!!"  
"That’s impossible! How could he eat so fast with that beak… he must be
a woodpecker, not an owl!!"  
"How could someone so small eat so much!?"  
  
…I never thought he’d actually win. Niru, who overwhelmed other
contestants and ate a mountain of hot dogs, was currently standing on
the winner’s podium with a smug look. By the way, the prize is a year's
supply of hot dogs. We won't have to worry about Niru's food expenses
for a while.  
  
"Where should we go next… Kyah!"  
"…!"  
  
Because the crowd was so dense, I bumped into someone. I quickly looked
at the person in a panic, who had fallen on their bottom.  
  
"I'm sorry, are you alright?"  
  
I reached out and spoke to the person. She was a girl about the same age
as Chloe, with white hair and eyes.
