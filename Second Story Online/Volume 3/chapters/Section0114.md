# 114・If You’re Going To Eat Poison, Might As Well Go All Out

Now that the large cauldron has been prepared, let's start production. I
also need to make the lake water potions Miranda-san requested.  
And I don't have any money. I've spent it all on buying new equipment
and repairs. I also have to pay taxes to the town.  
  
I prepared the ingredients as usual. However, since I'm using the large
cauldron this time, I'm using double the usual amount and stirring it.  
It's quite a struggle to stir because there’s so much. It's
time-consuming. ...I understand why Mixing is preferred for
potion-making. I'm almost tempted to consider taking the skill if I have
the spare points.  
  
"Alright...it's done! Wait? The potion's name is wrong?"  
  
\[All-Purpose Potion: A potion made with holy water. Treats all injuries
and illnesses, restoring full health.\]  
  
No, wait a minute. What I wanted to make was a fairly ordinary recovery
potion containing lake water...  
  
"Why is there something like this...?"  
"Obviously, if you use high-quality herbs grown in the lake water and
brew them in an advanced alchemy cauldron, that's bound to happen..."  
  
I can hear Lucille-san's exasperated voice...Yes, that makes sense.
That’s what happens.  
I forgot… this cauldron is for advanced alchemy. Since it's more
powerful than the tools I've been using, it naturally creates
higher-grade items.  
  
It took a lot of effort to make, but I'll have to remake it. It's a bit
too good.  
I very carefully remade the potions. I intentionally made mistakes in
the process, like messing up the amount of ingredients…  
By stacking these mistakes over and over again, the rank of the item
produced by the high-grade cauldron should drop. And I successfully
created a \[Recovery Potion\] instead of an \[All-Purpose Potion\].  
  
There were a few minor setbacks, but the potion production is now
complete.  
Five hundred potions in total. It used to take three hours to make a
hundred potions, but now I can make this quantity in the same amount of
time. It might have taken much longer without the large cauldron.  
  
After a short break, I'll start back up. Next, I want to try a little
experiment.  
I prepared some \[Dark Soup\]. To use this, you have to drink it. It's a
food, so it's only natural, but I want it to be a little more
user-friendly.  
I was wondering if it could be made so that it could be taken in one
bite, like a pill.  
  
I have something called \[Catan Grass\]. This is a type of herb also
used in cooking, and it apparently acts like cornstarch. If I add this
as a binder to the dark soup, surely...!  
  
"Ah, what?"  
  
The catan grass and dark soup I added to the cooking pot triggered a
failure effect, and it became a failed product. No matter how many times
I tried, I got the same result... does this combination not work?  
Could it be because I'm using dark soup? I tried adding catan grass
during the dark soup-making process, but...it just produced a normal
Dark Soup item.  
  
The failure effect means it's either a system-incompatible combination
or I lack the level—ah, maybe.  
  
This time, instead of a cooking pot, I'll try using the large cauldron I
used to make potions. I thought that it might not be possible with the
\[Cooking\] skill, but I might be able to with the \[Alchemy\] skill.  
I put in the dark soup instead of water and added the catan grass. Then
a sparkling effect appeared.  
  
\[Dark Soup Pill: When ingested, it gives the effects of \[Poison\],
\[Paralysis\], \[Sleep\], \[Stomachache\], \[High Fever\],
\[Weakening\], \[Frailty\], \[Slow\], \[Dizziness\], and \[Food
Ineffective\]\]  
  
…I did it! Using the alchemy cauldron was the right answer.  
I also made a version with \[Cold Medicine\] to add a \[Cold\] effect.
This will save me another bit of work.  
  
It's possible to pill-ify recovery potions, but the recovery effect
seems to be reduced. The same goes for dark soup, but the only thing
that has a reduced effect is the hunger-related effect. Perhaps because
the original is in the \[Cooking\] category that affects hunger?  
  
In any case, I want bad status effects, so this is fine.  
By the way, drinking an All-Purpose Potion after using this pill
completely cures everything. This will also make it easier to return to
normal.  
  
However...I’d like to have more bad status effects. So I'm going to
increase them even more.  
I worked hard to learn \[Language: Unirei\], so I can understand the
contents of the books now. As a result, I found a book in Lucille-san's
grimoire that summarized poisons that inflict bad status effects.
\[Defense Down Potion\], \[Magic Defense Down Potion\], \[Attack Down
Potion\], \[Magic Attack Down Potion\], and so on...  
  
So, I can recreate all those abnormal status effects I got from Azi-chan
using medicine.  
Catan grass can also be used as a medicine to raise defense. I'll be
using it to create medicine with the completely opposite effect.  
  
\[Defense Down Potion\] is made with catan grass, Lady Black, and poison
herb. \[Magic Defense Down Potion\] can be made by adding Blue Rose to
that. \[Attack Down Potion\] uses \[Purple Berry\], a type of wild
raspberry. Eating it directly slightly increases your attack power. I
can make it with that, Lady Black, and poison herb.  
  
Next is a \[Blinding Potion\]. It’s a poison that inflicts the
\[Blindness\] status ailment. It’s made with Red Grass and poison
herb.  
Now, let's finally mix them all together with the \[Dark Soup\] and it's
done!  
  
\[All-Purpose Poison Pill: Ingesting this gives the effects of
\[Poison\], \[Paralysis\], \[Sleep\], \[Stomachache\], \[High Fever\],
\[Weakening\], \[Frailty\], \[Slow\], \[Dizziness\], \[Food
Ineffective\], \[Cold\], \[Blindness\], \[Defense Down\], \[Magic
Defense Down\], and \[Attack Down\].\]  
  
Just one of these pills inflicts fifteen status ailments...I could kill
someone with just one of these.  
I have resistance to some, so twelve of them are effective on me  
...Come to think of it, I don't really need poison resistance after all,
right?  
  
So I went to a designated NPC and had it removed. I got 1 SP back and
one skill slot freed up. But I learned \[Language: Unirei\] for 3 SP, so
it's like I essentially traded for it.  
I also made a \[Magic Attack Down Potion\] just in case. My magic attack
is everything though, so I probably won’t use it.  
  
I'll sell these items at the upcoming celebration. This festival is to
celebrate the inauguration of the new lord. This is the first festival
in Dairode since the game service launched, and the players based in the
town seem to be very excited.  
  
It just so happens that many of the third-generation players are still
in the town, so it's expected to be quite lively. With the ferry service
also having resumed, there may even be visitors from the capital.  
If I set up a stall and sell them, it'll be great advertising. I've even
properly applied for a stall at the festival… though at the time, the
government official told me to pay my taxes properly.  
I guess that's because I bought Lucille-san's repossessed house...  
  
Well, if I set up a shop and increase my sales, I can pay my taxes.
Let's do our best.  
  
"Hm? What's this sweet smell...?"  
  
A sweet scent started to drift through the log house. Following the
scent to the kitchen, I saw the big back of Earl. Niru was already
beside him. He was sleeping on the perch just now, wasn't he? As
expected of Niru, his reaction is quick when it comes to food.  
  
"What are you making, Earl?"  
  
Earl turned around, smiling as if it was perfect timing, and offered me
a plate. On the white plate was a whole cake. And it's not just any
whole cake. It's a flower cake decorated with flowers resembling Blue
Roses. It's beautiful, like looking down at a bouquet from above.  
  
"Wow, beautiful!... Did you make this? That's amazing!"  
  
Earl smiled happily and shyly, and next to him, Niru flapped his wings
as if telling us to hurry up and eat. Don't you think it's a waste to
eat something so beautiful?  
But it's certainly a cake made by Earl. It must taste delicious too.  
  
I immediately prepared for tea time and decided to eat the flower cake
with everyone.  
  
"Delicious~!"  
"Ahh, I'm so happy~..."  
  
The sponge inside is fluffy, and the sweet whipped cream spread through
my mouth. It has a slight Blue Rose flavor, maybe because of the
ingredients.  
Lucille-san next to me was also stuffing her face with cake very
happily. Maybe it's because it's her first cake in a while, but she
seems happier than me. Combined with her current childlike appearance,
she looks like a girl who just loves cake.  
  
Niru was also pecking at the cake hungrily. He ate one piece and wanted
a second. After Earl gave him some, he indicated back and forth at the
medicine I had just made and the cake.  
  
"...Could it be that you want to use this cake as a product for the
upcoming festival?"  
  
Apparently, this cake was a prototype for that.. .I did think it would
be good to sell something other than medicine, and this is perfect.  
  
"Of course, that's fine. I'm sure this cake will sell like hotcakes."  
  
I nodded to Earl, who looked at me as if asking if it was okay, and he
showed a relieved and relaxed smile.
