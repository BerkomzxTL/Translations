# 113・New Equipment

"It's no good at all... I can't seem to get a foothold..."  
  
Miranda-san reported from across the counter, looking regretful. Since
the incident in the port town of Sealink, she’s been searching for
information about the Crimson Apostles of Chaos. Miranda-san has been
using her merchant connections to search for information, but it seems
she'd come up empty.  
  
"But what was the purpose of distributing those drugs?"  
  
Klin-kun asked curiously. He was a victim of a similar incident. He must
be worried that more people might become victims like him.  
  
"The story goes that they were selling it as a kind of doping agent. It
could serve as a source of funds, and there seems to be an experimental
purpose as well. Whatever the case may be, it's troubling that dangerous
drugs are being distributed."  
  
The victims in the port town only suffered mild effects, so we were able
to manage with potions…but if someone becomes severely Chaos-affected
like Klin-kun did, we won't be able to help them.  
  
"About that…it seems there have been an increasing number of incidents
related to that drug lately. Chloe-chan, if you wouldn't mind, could you
please supply us with those potions?"  
  
Similar incidents to the one in the port town have been popping up in
surrounding areas recently. The drugs have been confiscated, but people
are still using them, resulting in constant Chaos-induced rampages. For
now, the damage is at a level treatable with only potions, so if we have
them in supply, anyone can quickly cure victims.  
However, it’s a problem. That potion isn't really something I want to
openly distribute. But if I do circulate it, I can help protect the
safety of the residents.  
  
"Please, Chloe-chan! Think of it as helping the people!"  
"...Alright, I'll sell them. It seems I can get a good price. But please
keep my involvement secret."  
"Thank you, Chloe-chan~! Of course! I wouldn't tell anyone about a good
client~"  
  
Of course, there's goodwill involved, but I had the feeling Miranda-san
still has her business acumen even in times like this. So, in addition
to the usual potions, I decided to sell lake water potions with the same
properties as holy water. This will increase my income.  
  
Once that was decided, I had to start mass-producing them right away.
Thinking that, I returned to the front of my house in Dairode, but
someone was there. A small dwarf and a large, unfriendly-looking man.  
  
"You've finally come, I'm tired of waiting."  
"Oliver-kun, and Nick-san too… you’re already done?"  
"Yes."  
"Mine too, of course."  
  
I never expected the things I ordered to be finished already… Then I
felt someone tap me on the shoulder. I turned around and saw Earl nod.
…My weapon was also finished. Amazing.  
  
So the first thing I did was receive the finished equipment and get
changed.  
  
\[Twilight Dress\]  
This is the custom-made equipment ordered from Nick-san.  
The black-based flared dress was like Lady Black herself. Is this what a
suspicious noblewoman at a night gathering looks like? Wearing the
matching pointed hat makes me look properly witch-like.  
  
\[Amethyst Staff\]  
The staff Earl made me. It's a long, black staff made from obsidian
wood. The tip is rounded, and an amethyst, processed into a gemstone,
shines in the center. The rounded tip is designed so that Niru can use
it as a perch, which is typical Earl.  
  
\[Tears of the Moon\]  
This is an accessory using the moonlight stone that I ordered from
Oliver-kun. It's a necklace with a large, beautiful white stone dangling
from my neck. As the name suggests, it looks like a teardrop of the
moon. Once a day, it can emit enough moonlight to grant the
\[Moonlight\] effect.  
  
"Wow…!"  
  
I tried on everything, and it looks amazing!  
  
"It was worth designing it to suit you."  
"I knew this type of necklace would go well with that dress. I'm glad I
asked."  
"Wait…did you guys collaborate on the designs?"  
"I heard about the new armor. I thought I might as well make something
to go with it. I didn't want to make something that didn't match or have
the accessories stand out."  
"And Earl collaborated too."  
  
Earl too? When I turned around, he nodded in confirmation.  
No wonder the designs of each piece were similar, and they fit together
perfectly.  
  
"Thank you everyone."  
"As a craftsman, I can’t tolerate something half-baked."  
"Glad you like it…but pay up."  
"Of course."  
  
Since you did so much work for me, I’ll give you a little extra.  
From Oliver-kun, the large cauldron I'd ordered for repairs was also
returned. This job was also perfect.  
  
And one more thing. He also made equipment using the \[Magic Defense
Twin Orbs\].  
  
\[Twin Gem Amulet: An amulet using a red guardian stone that defends
against physical attacks and a blue guardian stone that defends against
magic attacks. Protects the wearer from all attacks. Breaks after one
use.\]  
  
"Here, Earl. Please keep this."  
  
With that, I handed the amulet over to Earl. I thought it would be
better for Earl to have it than me. Earl is an Orc NPC. He's more likely
to die than us players. And it would be a huge problem if something
happened to him while I was logged out. For his safety, this should
belong to Earl.  
Earl seemed unsure as to whether it was okay to receive such a nice
thing.  
  
"You’ve worked hard for me lately, so this is your reward. Besides,
you're important to me."  
  
So please take it. I gently pushed back his large hand, which had
reached out to return the item.  
Earl stared at the amulet in his hand for a while, then smiled happily
before accepting it.  
  
"I've bought new clothes for myself… should I buy new clothes for
Lucille-san and Earl as well?"  
  
On the way home, I suddenly realized. Lucille-san is currently borrowing
my dress, but I should get her some proper clothes. And I need to get
Earl some equipment.  
  
"Then you should leave it to Earl. It seems he learned how to make them
from Nick."  
  
Lucille-san's suggestion was followed by a nod from Earl. Apparently, he
learned while they were making my equipment. He seems motivated, so I
decided to just give him the materials and ask him to do it. I have some
of the fabric from my family’s House that I recently bought, so I'll
have him use that. I have homemade dyes, so he can change the colors as
much as he wants.  
  
"Fufu…Chloe! Behold, the figure of this young maiden!"  
  
There is a girl before me, happily fluttering the hem of a pretty dress
that matches her black and white hair. As soon as we returned to the log
cabin in the Twilight Forest from Dairode Town, Earl made Lucille-san's
clothes.  
  
  
"Amazing, Earl! I wish you would make some for me too."  
  
Earl smiled, a little shy, but happy. Earl’s own clothes are also new.
They’re inconspicuous, muted colors that hide his Orc-like features, but
they suit him well.  
If I need more equipment made in the future, I might ask him. By then,
his skills will surely have improved even more.
