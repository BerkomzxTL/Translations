# 71・The Testimony of White Rabbit-san

"Seriously... To have my hard-earned item stolen like this... I'm so
unlucky."  
"Don't give up, we'll definitely get it back! …Still, it sounds like
it's incredibly valuable~. I'm curious what it is, so could you tell
me~?"  
  
While Miranda-san was encouraging Oliver-kun, who was dejected, along
the way, she began to look at Oliver-kun with great interest. It seems
that her merchant's eye has been drawn to something of value.  
  
"Ah, what I unearthed is a raw \[Moonlight Stone\]. It's an item that
doesn't often appear in the upper layers, the kind that's mined in the
deep veins where access is usually forbidden. I thought I was lucky that
it appeared in my usual mining spot… but to be robbed… I'm really
unlucky…"  
  
It seems Oliver-kun is a jeweler. Apparently, he specializes in
processing magically mined ore and making ornaments using it. His usual
playstyle is to go and mine the ore himself and then make things with
it, and it seems he found a \[Moonlight Stone\] while doing so.  
  
"A \[Moonlight Stone\]... that's quite a rare ore~"  
“Is that so?”  
"Mhm. Certainly, its value as a magical ore isn't very high, but it has
the property of gathering moonlight, you see. Because the accumulated
light shines within the stone, it's a jewel popular with nobles as a
mineral with high artistic value～"  
  
Miranda-san taught me with such evident joy. She herself had apparently
been curious about that ore for some time and said she had wanted to see
it once.  
  
"Exactly! I thought I could process it into a necklace and sell it to
nobles for a high price..."  
  
Oliver sighed again and became depressed.  
  
"Well... bto be honest, it’s true that I was careless about being
cautious of thieves. I knew I should have been wary of player thieves...
but I didn't tell anyone about it... how did they find out?"  
“Really?  
"Of course. It's a valuable item, so there's no way I would give away
any information about it... so I shouldn't have said anything..."  
  
Oliver-kun crossed his arms and began to worry, reflecting on his
actions up to that point, as he wondered how he had been found out.  
  
"Ah... I think I might have mentioned it casually to an NPC... but the
thieves who attacked me seemed like players. Would they really find out
that way?"  
"Isn't it also possible that they were secretly listening to that
conversation?"  
"Ah, that's possible... they knew I had it. They asked to buy it and I
refused. I have no idea where players are lurking. I need to be more
careful."  
  
That’s true. In this game, it's incredibly difficult to distinguish
between players and NPCs. Even Oliver-kun, though not a role-player
himself, could blend in seamlessly with the crowds. Even the
conversation we just had, while it was said by a player, is usually hard
to notice unless you pay close attention.  
  
…There's a possibility the person he slipped up with wasn't an NPC. Or,
like before, they overheard it, or that NPC told someone else.  
  
"Still, it seems you initially intended to negotiate. Because you
refused, they stole it, is that it?"  
  
I remember one of them saying that they only stole it because Oliver-kun
supposedly refused negotiations.  
  
"Well, yeah. No matter the reason, I wasn’t giving it up... so this is
the result."  
  
Was it something they wanted that badly? As Miranda-san said just now,
it seems to be something valuable, so they may have stolen it for the
money.  
  
  
The guard station is located in the city center, its presence marked by
a flag bearing a sword and shield emblem fluttering on the stark
building wall.  
  
"I hope we can get some information on Klin-kun."  
"Yeah, and we have to ask them to catch the thieves who stole Oliver's
things too!"  
“Finding him sounds more important than this…”  
  
While having such a conversation, we entered from the doorway flanked by
men in armor who seemed to be guards. Inside is a wide entrance hall. We
were about to head towards the reception, but I saw a familiar figure in
the hall. He was clad in armor like the guards, but it was a different
kind of armor. He carried a large shield on his back- a handsome young
man who truly looked like a knight.  
  
"...Oh my, Chloe. I never thought I'd run into you here."  
"Kyle-san, it's been a while."  
  
There's Kyle-san, as always, greeting me with a sparkling, bright
smile.  
  
“……I’m here too, you know?”  
“Ah, Light-kun, it’s been a while.”  
  
Light-kun was also next to Kyle-san.  
Excuse me, your presence was obscured by the brilliance of Kyle-san.  
  
If only he shone as brightly as his name suggests, like Kyle-san… it
would be a little easier to understand. Incidentally, his greatsword
seems to still be missing, as usual.  
  
"I see... so you're looking for Klin-kun and Oliver-kun is searching for
a thief..."  
  
Kyle-san, who had been listening to our conversation with the guard,
murmured that.  
  
"Do you guys know anything?"  
"I'm sorry. I don't have any useful information about a boy who looks
like Klin-kun, or about the three thieves."  
"I see..."  
  
I thought that Kyle-san, who got to this town before us, might know
something, but it seems he doesn't know anything at all.  
  
"...But, regarding the assault case, I do have something."  
"Ah, old man Kyle and I… We happened to stumble upon that incident."  
  
...Light-kun started to say something, but somehow corrected his
statement due to Kyle-san's incredibly fierce glare. Kyle-san, please
act your role. That expression doesn't suit you, \[Kyle\]-san. Noticing
my gaze, Kyle-san hastily fixed his face and continued the
conversation.  
  
“Yesterday, we happened to pass by the scene of an assault in a back
alley of the artisan district. By the time we arrived, the perpetrator
was gone, and only the victim was lying there.”  
"We protected the victim, you see."  
  
That means they've seen the victim's face, haven't they? I thought
Klin-kun might be the victim, but judging by their reaction, that seems
unlikely.  
  
It seems he’s unrelated to this incident. Though I breathed a sigh of
relief, we're back to square one. From our conversation just now, it
seems the assailant in the assault case hasn't been caught, so it's also
important that we find Klin-kun quickly.  
  
"Incidentally, who was the victim?"  
  
一When I was about to ask about the victim, I heard the sound of a door
opening from the back.  
  
"Thank you so much!"  
  
Two individuals emerged from the inner room. One was a guard in armor.  
  
The other was a human, but not exactly human. A white rabbit with long,
upright ears, her body covered in white fur, and bandages on her head
and arms.  
  
"That's her."  
  
Kyle-san said this, looking at her as she walked from the back.  
  
It seems that the beastkin was the victim. However, she seems to be a
pure beastkin. Her face is covered in fur; she's just like a rabbit.  
  
When I saw that dog-rabbit on the Dairode plains, I thought that all
rabbits in this world looked like that, but it seems that's not the
case. She’s so cute that I couldn't help but follow her with my eyes.  
  
Considering that she's the victim this time, I feel that, ah, she would
certainly be attacked. She's a small, cute white rabbit beastkin, after
all.  
  
"It seems the conversation is over."  
"I hope they catch the criminal soon... What about those people?"  
  
The white rabbit, who had been talking with Kyle-san, turned towards me.
I had been staring intently at her, so my eyes met her and shifted my
gaze towards Kyle-san.  
  
"They are my friends. They've come here for reasons of their own."  
"Ohh~ My name is Poco. As you can see, I was attacked yesterday... I was
knocked unconscious and collapsed, but Kyle-san and the others rescued
me."  
  
Her cute appearance was complemented by the way she talks, making her
even cuter. Her long bunny ears sway whenever she speaks.  
  
"It’s Poco-chan, is it? I'm Miranda. I'm a merchant in Dairode Town. So,
I'd like to ask you something. We're here looking for someone. Did you
happen to see a boy with light brown hair? He's about this tall..."  
  
After everyone had finished their introductions, Miranda-san asked her
if she knew Klin-kun. The incident occurred near the shop Klin-kun went
to. Furthermore, he went missing yesterday. She probably wants to know
if she saw him anywhere before she got involved.  
  
"Hmm? I've never seen a human boy like that... ―Ah!""  
  
Poco-chan, as if noticing something, perked up her ears.  
  
"I think I might have met him! ―Actually, that boy saved me!"  
"Eh... is that really true!?"  
  
I never would have imagined that Klin-kun would be involved in the
incident…. We were both surprised by White Rabbit-san's words.  
  
"Um, I just remembered a little bit of what happened before I fainted...
Well, I can't say for sure if it was that boy... but a boy who looked
exactly like him saved me. It seems like he drew the perpetrator's
attention to help me, who was being attacked... Um, I don't remember it
well. I hit my head and my consciousness was hazy... I don't know what
happened to that boy either... I'm sorry."  
"No, thank you for telling me. It gave me a clue to find Klin."  
  
Miranda-san thanked Poco-chan like that, but her expression was stiff.
If the boy who helped was Klin-kun, I wonder what happened afterwards…
I’m very worried.  
  
"Excuse me, do you remember what kind of person the perpetrator of that
assault case was?"  
"Um... well..."  
  
Poco-chan was clutching her head and lost in thought. As her long ears
gradually drooped, my expectations faded. Then, suddenly, her ears
perked up.  
  
"...I remember now! It's a pink-haired demon! A demon child with a big
scythe!"  
"A pink-haired demon child...?"  
  
...Could that be the demon child who deceived the village chief of Berry
Village and tried to kill the villagers?
