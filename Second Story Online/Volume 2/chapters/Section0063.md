# 63・Let’s Fly in the Sky

It seems I forgot something important. No, I believe I have always acted
with it in mind.  
  
I think I should strive for it now more than ever.  
  
Yes, it's "witchiness."  
  
That's why I start playing this game, so I have to master it. This glass
skull I unexpectedly just bought taught me that.  
  
And of course, what I lack now as a witch is…  
  
"Flying on a broom!"  
  
As I stood there in the tree, several people looked up at me.  
  
One was the usual disappointed look. Another was a worried, flustered
gaze.  
  
"Kakaka. You seem to be up to something interesting."  
  
Then, a curious look.  
  
While being subjected to the three gazes, I gripped the broom. My body
is wrapped in wind thanks to \[Wind Step\]. \[Air Shock\] is also at the
ready.  
  
Now, all I have to do is throw myself into the air. If it goes well, I
might fly. If not, I'll just fall.  
  
That's all. There are only two possible outcomes. Two very simple
conclusions.  
  
And Chloe isn't afraid; she wants to fly. I'm the only one who’s scared.
So I have to embody that. As the player who plays Chloe.  
  
I fell many times the last time I tried. I've been trying to fly
whenever I have free time since then, so this is my 100th attempt. If I
can't do it this time, I'll have to change my approach.  
  
"Here I go!"  
  
Gripping the broom tightly, I threw myself upward. I held my breath. I
used \[Air Shock\] to gain altitude. The wind pushed my soaring body
upwards even higher.  
  
Just keep going, just keep going up into the sky. Don't look at the
ground, it'll scare you. So, I kept my eyes fixed upwards and raised the
broom towards the sky.  
  
"Ah…"  
  
At that moment, I felt a floating sensation. The momentum from \[Air
Shock\] should have long since faded. I should be falling.  
  
It was unsteady, but I felt like I was floating. My legs astride the
broom swayed in the wind, far from the ground.  
  
The sky feels close. Beneath me sprawled the green of the \[Twilight
Forest\]. In the distance, I could see Dairode Town in the middle of the
plains, and small villages scattered here and there. To the east
stretched a magnificent sea reflecting the sunlight.  
  
This… This is!?  
  
《A new skill has become available due to specific actions.》  
  
"I did it! Aaaaaah!"  
  
My body, overjoyed despite my age, began to fall as if remembering the
gravity it had forgotten. Even if I fall to the hard ground, it won't
hurt too much. At this height, my HP will be zero, though.  
  
"Wha…?"  
  
The feeling of the ground on my back… no, it's slightly hard, soft, and
warm. Looking up, a stern face peered down at me with concern.  
  
"Thank you for catching me, Earl."  
  
It seems Earl caught me just before I hit the ground. He smiled with
relief, showing his fangs, and set me down.  
  
Now then… let's check. I quickly opened the skills screen. From the list
of available skills, I searched for the one I'm looking for.  
  
\[Flight: Broom\] SP5  
  
It's treated as a special skill, so it costs slightly more SP than
normal skills. But I acquired it without hesitation.  
  
…Finally. I finally learned how to fly on a broom! I've taken another
step closer to my image of the ideal witch!  
  
"This is the first time I've seen someone acquire that skill through
brute force."  
"…Brute force?"  
"I have a spellbook on flying magic at home. You can learn it by reading
it."  
  
What? So I could have learned the skill without going through all that
fear? What was the point of all my effort…?  
  
"If you had it at home, why didn't you tell me?"  
"You can't rely only on the wisdom of your ancestors. I thought gaining
power through your own strength alone would be a good experience."  
"That's a very plausible excuse. You probably just didn't tell me
because it looked fun."  
"Kakaka. Well, you got the power you wanted, so it worked out in the
end, right?"  
  
Black cat Lucille-san laughed and dodged the question. She's supposed to
be Chloe's master… but she doesn't teach much. I think I chose the wrong
master.  
  
Anyway, let's try out the skill I just got. I stood on the ground and
got on the broom. My current outfit has a long skirt, so I’m sitting on
the broom handle. I activated the skill, and the broom gently lifted
up.  
  
"Well, I'll give it a try too."  
  
Lucille-san hopped onto the broomstick.  
  
"This is my first time, so I might fall."  
"I'll guide you so you don't. Niru, take the lead. Earl, you stand by on
the ground in case anything happens."  
  
As instructed, Niru flew into the sky. Earl nodded and moved away.  
  
"It's best to gradually increase your altitude. Since it's your first
time, take it slow."  
  
Lucille-san glanced at me and spoke kindly… So she can act like a master
after all.  
  
I could ascend by lifting the broom handle upwards. Gradually, higher
and higher I went. To pass through the gaps in the trees, I tilted the
broom to the left and right as I ascended.  
  
"Whoa…"  
  
I was back in the sky above the forest. This time, I didn't fall and was
able to stay in the air. So I was able to take my time and enjoy the
scenery.  
  
The world stretching around me seems to continue endlessly, glittering
brilliantly. This is it, this is what I wanted to see!  
  
"Ah!"  
  
As I was enjoying the view, the wind started to blow. I held on tightly
to the broomstick and weathered it.  
  
"Did you enjoy the view? Now let's take a stroll in the sky."  
"Yes."  
"Right. Like before, the wind is blowing high above. You need to
skillfully ride the wind or you'll fall, so be careful. You're still a
beginner, so you won't be able to read the movement of the wind. So it's
best to have Niru guide you."  
  
Niru appeared nearby, flapping his wings. Even though it's getting late
and it's evening, he still seems slightly sleepy.  
  
"Thank you, Niru."  
  
He nodded grudgingly, staring at me with a bored expression. Then, he
flew off to take the lead. I moved the broom to follow him.  
  
I'm flying in the sky a little faster than walking. I was leaving the
scenery around me behind. The wind rustled my hair and clothes, making
some noise. It's a little difficult to operate since I'm sitting
sideways, but it's okay if I go slowly.  
  
It's fun. I never thought flying would be so fun. My fear has completely
vanished.  
  
"Flying is enjoyable, isn't it?"  
"Yes. My long-held dream has come true."  
  
I'm flying on a broom against the backdrop of the twilight sky. And in
front of me is a black cat. Ah… am I not perfectly witch-like right now?
Hehehe…  
  
"Chloe! You're going too fast!"  
"What!?"  
  
The scene of Niru frantically avoiding was mixed in with the scenery
flowing by at high speed behind me. Oops, I must have been so excited
that I neglected the controls.  
  
"Wh-where's the brake!?"  
"Pull your body and the broom back!"  
  
I pulled my body back sharply, and the speed decreased as if I'd slammed
the brakes. My relief was fleeting. Because of the sudden stop, the
broom handle is almost vertical. I managed to desperately grip the broom
to keep my balance, so I didn't fall.  
  
"Lucille-san!"  
  
But the small black cat in front of me was flung into the air. She's
going to fall… Just as I thought that, a white shadow swooped in.  
  
"Phew… I managed to survive."  
"Good… Niru, thank you."  
  
Niru shook his head, as if to sigh. I'm sorry, I got a little carried
away. I'll drive more safely from now on.  
  
After that, I landed immediately. That's because my flight time limit
was reached. MP gradually decreases while flying. With my current MP,
five minutes is the limit.  
  
I wanted to keep flying forever, but it's a game mechanic, so I can't
help it. Also, it seems that I can't carry passengers until my skill
level increases. It seems like it's okay for small animals like
Lucille-san.
