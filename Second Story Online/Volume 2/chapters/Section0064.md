# 64・A Mountain of Unreadable Knowledge

"This is no good, I can't read it at all..."  
  
I closed the book I had been holding and sighed. Chloe would surely be
disappointed. Of course, I'm a little disappointed too.  
  
When I obtained the skill to fly, Lucille-san said that there was a
grimoire in her house that could’ve helped me acquire it sooner.  
  
So I decided to take a look at Lucille-san's bookshelf out of curiosity.
It has a truly wide variety of books, including grimoires, picture
books, and novels. But my joy was short-lived. The variety wasn't just
in type; the languages they were written in was also diverse.  
  
In other words, they were all books I couldn't read. Honestly, if I
could just magically acquire the ability to read them, language wouldn't
be a problem… But I can't believe I'm stuck because I can't read the
books that tell me how to master it...  
  
"Those books are all from Unirei, the magic city in the Tessera region.
Since it's a city where magicians gather, many of the published
grimoires are in the Unirei language."  
"...Is that so?"  
  
Where is the Tessera region...?  
Looking it up, it seems to be a region adjacent to the Duo region where
I am now. It seems to be a region where important places are
concentrated, such as the holy capital and the magic city. Well, it's
not a place that matters much to me right now. There are still places in
the Duo region that I haven't been to yet.  
  
And I may not even be able to go there. As a guardian, it's difficult to
leave this forest. ... Honestly, as a player, I'd like to go. If I could
create a sub-character, I'd be agonizing over whether to go sightseeing
in a different region.  
  
I returned the book I couldn't read and picked up the next one. This
book is written in Swaro Kingdom language, so I can read it. However,
I'm still under-leveled, so there are parts I can't read, and I didn't
manage to understand everything in this book either.  
  
Incidentally, the Swaro Kingdom language is one of the Duo region
languages, and there are about four languages in total. Apparently, if
you learn all of them, the skills will be integrated into \[Language:
Duo Region Language\].  
  
"...If only it were in the Heiss region dialect."  
  
I have \[Language: Heiss Region Language\], so I can handle any ethnic
language used in the Heiss region. Incidentally, there are four types of
languages there as well. The Heiss region is where Chloe's hometown is.
However, it wasn't on this bookshelf.  
  
"Sorry. All the books related to the Heiss region are only translated
versions; there are no original texts."  
  
It seems I won't be able to read something in the Heiss region language
after all. But Lucille-san casually knows \[Language: Duo Region
Language\] and \[Language: Tessera Region Language\]. To have mastered
the languages of two regions...  
  
"Lucille-san, since you understand the language, could you please read
this grimoire for me?"  
  
I showed Lucille-san the book I gave up reading earlier. I can't read
it, but Lucille-san can. So I realized that I could have her translate
it for me.  
  
"Hmm, very well. That book is about summoning magic, and it's about the
familiar contract magic that you've also acquired. The first chapter
summarizes the beings you can contract as familiars. Basically, those
who can be contracted are limited to those with souls. This is because
the mechanism of the familiar contract magic is a contract between the
souls of the contractor and the familiar, so it's impossible for those
without souls. As another exception, spirit species have souls that are
superior to humans, and their souls are not a match for human souls.
Therefore, it's impossible to form a familiar contract, which involves
an equal contract of souls, with them. Although it's an equal contract,
the contractor is usually in a superior position, so there's probably
also the reason that those proud spirits won't agree to it. If you want
to contract with them, it's better to use spirit contract magic instead.
Whether it's one or the other, it's useless if the contract is refused.
With that in mind—"  
  
"...I'm sorry, I don't need it after all."  
  
...Not only did she translate it, but she also added her own commentary.
If I had listened seriously, I probably would have been tied up for
hours.  
  
"Hmm, is that so...?"  
  
Lucille-san closed her mouth with a disappointed look. Her tail, which
had been wagging happily while she was talking, drooped. I somehow feel
like I did something bad. ...What should I do?  
  
Come to think of it, this book is about familiars. Chloe also has the
skill \[Summoning: Familiar\]. Chloe seems to have learned magic on her
own, but perhaps she learned it by reading grimoires like this. Yes,
that's probably true. That's what I've just concluded.  
  
"That... I think the explanation you just gave was the same as the
summoning magic grimoire I was reading... but it was written in the Ente
Kingdom language."  
"Is that so? ...Hmm, indeed, several of my books have been translated
into other languages. Perhaps the book you read was one I wrote."  
"Eh, was this book also written by Lucille-san?"  
  
I looked at the book I picked up again without thinking. ...I can't tell
who the author is because I don't understand the language, but it
probably says Lucille-san. It's the first time I've ever seen this book
cover, but it might be nostalgic for Chloe. So I decided to ask one more
question.  
  
"...Did you also publish grimoires on dark magic and wind magic?"  
"Yes, I published a full set of basic magic grimoires for beginners.
They were said to be easy to understand and easy for beginners to read,
so they sold quite well..."  
  
Lucille-san said this as if reminiscing about the past. Indeed, when I
went to learn skills, all the apprentice books I was given had
Lucille-san's name.  
  
...Was the apprentice book I borrowed written in Swaro Kingdom language?
I remember being able to read that book without any problems. So that
must have been it.  
  
Honestly, I don't know what language it was written in. It was
automatically translated into Japanese for me to read, and even if I
look at the original text, I wouldn't be able to tell if it was Swaro
Kingdom language. Since I borrowed it from the skill master, it may have
been a special version that allowed me to read it regardless of the
language.  
  
Anyway, I learned that Lucille-san has published multiple grimoires.
Then...  
  
"...Lucille-san has been my teacher from the beginning. I first learned
magic from this book. If it weren't for this, I wouldn't be who I am
today."  
  
Chloe, a noble, ran away from home and pursued her dream of becoming a
magician. The first step towards that dream was surely this first
grimoire she ever touched. I role-played while thinking about Chloe's
past.  
  
"Thank you, Lucille-san."  
"...Heh heh heh, I'm embarrassed to have someone thank me to my face.
However, it makes me very happy that my book inspired a girl like you to
pursue the path of a magician. If it weren't for that, we wouldn't have
met like this..."  
  
Lucille-san said this with a somewhat sentimental expression.  
  
"I feel good. Shall I sign this book for you?"  
"I'd be happy, but can you sign it?"  
"If you're okay with Belle's paw print signature."  
  
So I got a paw print autograph. I promised myself that I’d get her
actual signature sometime. I'll carefully store the signed book in my
inventory. ...I hope I don't drop it.  
  
"However... you're from the Ente Kingdom in the Heiss region. You've
come from quite a faraway place."  
"Yes, well... a lot of things happened."  
  
I tried to give off an aura that suggests I don't want to be asked about
it. In reality, the fact that she, a noble, is here is quite
suspicious.  
  
Well, I just don't want to be pressed on that point. I can't talk about
my family's settings. I wonder what kind of people Chloe's father and
mother are. Does she have siblings...? If she was able to run away from
home, it seems likely that she has younger siblings. Ah, if she had an
older brother, she could easily leave.  
  
...This is no good. I don't know too much about my own character. I
think I should get some information about her family.

173:// Anonymous User 2  
\>172 It's a story from just recently. It was a war started by two
players who proposed to an NPC named Aria. The problem was that both of
those players were clan masters, and their clans were quite large.
Moreover, it was a dispute between clans, but even noble players
participated, and as a result, it escalated into a large-scale war that
even involved kingdoms.

//////////////////////////  
  
  
...I thought I'd check to see if there was any information, but there
was nothing. Instead, I learned something amazing.  
  
Well, that's fine. I'll look into things related to my family later.  
  
Now, there was one book I managed to read somehow, and it was a recipe
book. It's about recipes for herbal tea using various herbs and
medicinal plants. ...It was the kind of recipe I could easily find by
searching on a strategy site.  
  
I decided to try making it. Perhaps because it was treated as something
I had learned from a recipe in a book, it was added to my skill list of
recipes.  
  
This time, I'll make a fresh green herb tea. So I just put the green
herbs in boiling water and steamed it for about five minutes without
drying it. It's really easy. Well, it is a game.  
  
My hunger was starting to increase, so I'll have some tea. I also have
some sandwiches I bought in town. They’re from that lady at the food
stall.  
  
I arranged the teapot and cups containing the finished tea on the table.
Arranged with the tablecloth that Earl made and a vase of blue roses, it
was almost picturesque. I almost want to take a picture and post it on
social media.  
  
"Let's have some late afternoon tea."  
  
When I called out to those around me, everyone gathered. Earl sat down
in the seat opposite me, and Lucille-san sat on the table next to him.  
  
Niru was already on the table, looking at me as if to say, "Are you
ready yet?".  
  
"Yes, yes, you can eat."  
  
As if he had been waiting for those words, he began to eat the sandwich,
poking it with his beak. His long tufts and tail feathers are swaying
happily.  
  
Is it that delicious? Then I'll eat too.  
  
I took a bite of the sandwich with smoked salmon-like red fish and
lettuce. Oh, it's definitely delicious. Although it's not apparent from
the looks, it's been drizzled with lemon juice, which brings out the
flavor of the fish.  
  
Then I took a sip the green herbal tea I made. The refreshing taste
characteristic of herbal tea is also nice.  
  
"It's delicious."  
  
Earl nodded in agreement. Ah... having a tea party like this with
everyone is nice. I almost want to invite that friend of mine. It would
be nice to invite her when she starts playing.  
  
*'I'm envious.'*  
  
I heard Lucille-san's voice near my ear. She seemed to have released her
possession, and Belle was eating cat food on the table.  
  
Belle is a normal cat, so unlike Niru, the familiar, she can't eat just
anything. Lucille-san is currently a familiar, but since she doesn't
have a body, she can't eat either.  
  
"I'd like to eat together sometime."  
*'That's right. But there's no need to rush.'*  
  
Now I have another reason to give Lucille-san a body.  
  
"...Hm?"  
  
It was while we were enjoying our tea party. A notification came up, so
I checked it. This notification is supposed to ring if suspicious people
approach the entrance of the White Forest...  
  
Someone else has come. I wonder who it is. To disturb my tea time...
what kind of scoundrel...  
  
"——Red Hood!"  
  
In the video of the forest displayed, there was a person dressed exactly
like the red-hooded man I saw that time. ...And there were two of
them.
