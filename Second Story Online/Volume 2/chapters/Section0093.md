# 93・Phantom City (2)

"What?! How did you know?! My \[Stealth\] skill was activated–"  
"Skills don't work on this server, Tsubaki-san."  
"Oh, right!!!"  
  
Tsubaki-san… In the game, she wouldn't make such a mistake during her
role-play, so why is the real person so… clumsy?  
  
"Hey you!! Give back my sword!!!"  
"Ah, please spare me that! I can't return what I can't return!"  
"Oi, Light. Calm down for now. Don't bring up character-specific
circumstances here."  
  
As expected… Light-kun, still without his sword, confronted Tsubaki-san,
and Kyle-san stepped in to protect her.  
  
"But why were you watching us like that, hiding?"  
"Well, because… my Tsubaki stole Light-kun's sword… and she also killed
Chloe-san this time… Ah, I'm really sorry about that! Considering
Tsubaki's actions, I prioritized the mission, so I had no choice… I'm
really sorry…"  
  
Tsubaki-san apologized while fiddling with her fingers behind Kyle-san,
looking apologetic.  
  
"Why do you need to apologize? You killed Chloe because you role-played
as 'Tsubaki' realistically. Besides, didn't Kyle-san say it? We
shouldn't bring character-specific situations here."  
"Aren't you angry…?"  
"No, not at all. I was surprised, to be honest, but at the same time, I
felt like I had been outsmarted."  
  
I was really surprised at the time. I never imagined that Tsubaki-san
was secretly connected to the Red Hood guys. Well, it didn't seem like
she was directly involved with them, though.  
  
As soon as I said that, Tsubaki-san's gloomy face brightened up.  
  
"Really?! Really?! Thank you so much, Chloe-dono! …Ah, sorry! It's a
habit of mine…"  
  
Tsubaki-san hid her blushing face with her scarf. I've heard that people
sometimes slip into their role-play habits. …Looking at the voice
analysis log, Tsubaki-san seems to add "dono" after names.  
  
"No, it's okay. But next time we meet, I won't show any mercy. Chloe
isn't forgiving you, you know."  
"Yes! I understand very well that not everything is forgiven, even in
role-play. So, please knock me down without mercy next time we meet!"  
  
That's not the kind of line you say with a smile… but well, she seems
happy, so it's fine.  
  
Tsubaki-san felt guilty and apologized, but she's also ruthless when it
comes to role-play. She's a surprisingly scary person. I’ll need to be
on my guard next time we meet in-game.  
  
"Next time we meet, Light-kun, you can attack me mercilessly, okay?"  
"Eh, no, w-well, you did steal my sword… but if you say that, I feel…
awkward…"  
  
When Tsubaki-san said that to him, Light-kun replied with a slightly
embarrassed look in his eyes. ...How should I put it, Light-kun seems
nervous when talking to Tsubaki-san.  
  
"If you only look at the 'Tsubaki’ character, it's fine, but… Light-kun,
don't be fooled. She might be a 'nekama' (male pretending to be female
online)!"  
"……What are you saying?! I already considered that possibility!"  
  
Despite that, your voice is a bit shaky, Light-kun.  
  
"Um, I'm a girl, though…"  
"I know that."  
  
As far as I can tell from looking at Tsubaki-san, she's female. If she's
really a 'nekama', I'll praise her without reservation.  
  
"What do you think of me?"  
"You're 70% male…"  
"Eh… 70%…"  
  
I'm subtly shocked. Was I not seen as a woman that much…?  
  
"Well, you know, sometimes it’s guys who use cute characters… Before, a
female character I tried to seduce turned out to be a guy… And he was
just a regular player…"  
  
Kyle-san slumped his shoulders as he remembered the incident.  
Since it's a game where you can also pretend to be someone else, it's
only natural that you'll come across cases like that...  
  
"I see, I see. I understand that my feminine charm is only 30%…"  
"I'm sorry, my phrasing was bad."  
"But Kyle-san, even if you think that way, you still treated me like a
woman, didn't you?"  
"Because the character (Chloe) is a woman, right?"  
  
Kyle-san answered as a matter of course. Ah, that's right… 'Chloe' is a
woman. Even if he saw me as 70% male, 'Chloe' being female doesn't
change, so he'd treat me like a woman…  
  
In anime or theater, if a woman plays a boy's role, you wouldn't
automatically consider the boy character to be female, would you?
Kyle-san really separates the character from the person.  
  
"Anyway, why is someone like you role-playing 'Tsubaki’? Your
personalities really don't match…"  
  
Looking at her, she seems like a very polite and nice girl. It's the
exact opposite of the merciless Tsubaki-san who stabs people in the
back.  
  
"Ah, that's… because of my background and experiences. I guess the
environment surrounding Tsubaki made her like that…"  
"I thought it was just acting because of your ninja skills… it's not?"  
"No, it's not. If it were, I'd want to find a master and serve them. I
feel that way now too. …I've always admired those kinds of ninjas. I
want to be able to become just like them."  
"Is that so?"  
"Yeah, I've been doing gymnastics since I was little because I wanted to
be like a ninja!"  
  
Although there's some in-game assistance, this is a VR game that depends
on your original athletic ability. I knew Tsubaki-san had high physical
ability, but if she does rhythmic gymnastics, it makes sense.  
  
"You really want to be a ninja, don't you?"  
"Yes, that's right! I love Japanese culture, not just ninjas, but
samurai too!"  
  
Tsubaki-san spoke with shining eyes. She seems a little excited.  
  
"I want to dye my hair black so that I’ll look good in a kimono… but
there are school rules, and my mom said no… I want to be like Tsubaki,
but in reality it's pretty difficult."  
  
It turns out Tsubaki-san is naturally blonde. Her eyes are also blue,
and she says it clashes with a kimono.  
  
"Ah, I don't want to hear about the details any more. Stop, stop!"  
  
Kyle-san waved his hand, ending the conversation. …He seemed to not want
to continue this topic anymore. Well, it was a bit too personal, I
guess.  
  
"Hey, I'm curious, why did 'Tsubaki’ steal my sword?"  
  
That's certainly something I'm curious about. Since Tsubaki-san was with
the Red Hood side this time, I'm also curious about the reason…  
  
"Ah, 'Tsubaki' was originally hired for that. I think… it was around the
time the second generation started playing the game? No, maybe later. I
think Chloe-san and I were capturing Haku around that time…"  
"…Wait, is Tsubaki-san a first-generation player?"  
"Uh, that's right. I don't have much time to log in, so my progress is a
bit slower than other first-generation players."  
  
Tsubaki-san was in the first batch of players. Well, it's true that when
we captured Haku together, I thought you looked like you were at a high
level...  
  
"I was told that the lord of that town possessed a sword that seemed to
have been used by the hero. So, I went there to steal it."  
"Was the Greatsword Rex the lord's? Eh, it was sunk in the river..."  
"Ah, how did Chloe know… Well, it's true that it was submerged in the
river."  
  
So it really did sink…  
  
"I got it from an old fisherman, but honestly, I didn't know that
either."  
"It was in the river? Seriously… But why was it stuck in the river?"  
  
Kyle-san's question is reasonable. According to Tsubaki-san, why was the
Greatsword Rex, which was originally in the lord's possession, in the
river…?  
  
"Of course—that’s the work of we, the Shiokaze Bandits!"  
  
A cat beastgirl, Azi-chan, appeared. Along with her, the elf Saval-kun.
And the dwarf, Bluey-kun, too.  
  
"That's right, to tell you the truth, we were the ones who first stole
the Greatsword Rex that the lord owned!"  
"Don't act so cool… Azi dropped it into the river while we were running
away."  
"Well, it's true that it was our doing."  
  
Saval-kun looked at Azi-chan, who is puffing out her chest for some
reason, with a weary expression. Bluey-kun tried to calm him down and
had a gentle smile.  
  
"Could it be that when you saved me from them…?"  
"That's right. After that, I got information that they had stolen it, so
Tsubaki went after them. Then Chloe-san was attacked, so I helped her as
well."  
  
Who would have thought that the truth behind that incident would only
come to light now...  
  
"But why did you guys try to steal the Greatsword Rex?"  
"Because Lucille-san asked us to."  
  
…That secretive person! I couldn't help but look around the city to try
and find her.  
  
"In the end, we couldn't complete the request, but looking back, I think
it was needed for something related to the Red Beast."  
"I guess so…"  
  
I agree with Saval-kun. To break the Red Beast's curse, the power of the
hero was needed… In the end, she couldn’t be saved, though.  
  
"By the way, why do you have Lucille-san as your familiar?!"  
"Ah… um. That's a spoiler, so I'll keep it a secret!"  
  
I understand your curiosity. The fact that I summoned Lucille-san as a
familiar is now widely known. Well, it's obvious if you think about it.
Why I have Lucille-san as my familiar…  
  
…Ah, it's only a matter of time before my identity as the Guardian is
revealed. It's already been exposed to those who I didn't want to figure
it out, so I've given up. I'll just dodge the question for now…  
  
"Ah, Chloe-chan and everyone! Yay~!"  
"Oh, isn't that Miranda-san?"  
  
She arrived at the perfect time! I can use this to change the subject.  
  
"Hey, it's you, young lady!"  
"Oh, you're here too, young lady-"  
"The old folk are here too… wait, what?!"  
  
Behind Miranda-san, walking towards us, were the old man and woman who
ran food stalls in Dairode Town—  
  
"You guys were players?!"  
  
The circle pointing to them was green, which meant that they’re both
players.  
  
"Ahahaha! How many times is this?"  
"Ah… how many times is it now? Everyone we meet is surprised…"  
  
The older woman burst into laughter, and the old man smiled awkwardly.  
  
"I never thought you two were players… I thought for sure you were
NPCs…"  
"I understand~, since we sometimes talk. But I was the one who was
surprised."  
  
Miranda-san is a role-player, so it's understandable.  
  
In my case, I had talked to the two of them before… it's much better
now, but the translation was sometimes awkward, so I might not have
noticed their player-like behavior.  
  
"We're not really role-players or anything… We seem to have blended in
quite well."  
"It's a long-standing habit… We were really running a shop until
recently."  
"I see…"  
  
Neither of them seemed to be playing a game, nor were they acting; they
just seemed to be acting naturally as they served the customers, which
is probably why it was hard to tell.  
  
They’re a married couple in real life. After their son and his wife took
over the shop, they started playing the game as a pastime after
retirement.  
  
"But in the end, we're not doing anything different. Opening a shop,
serving food…"  
"Well, it's fresh and fun to do business in a place far from reality."  
  
They said that and laughed. It's not uncommon for people who have
retired from their jobs to start playing games as a pastime. I started
playing games for the same reason as them.  
  
The work I used to do is now done by support robots. My job is gone, but
I received a generous severance package, so I can say I'm grateful that
I now have this much free time.  
  
"By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Tetsu. I'm from the
first batch of this game."  
"I'm Sunny. I'm a first-generation player, just like Tetsu."  
  
The old man and woman from the stall are Tetsu-san and Sunny-san. I
should visit their shop next time I return to the town. Niru will surely
be hungry. But…  
  
"So you two were both in the first batch..."  
"I'm a first-generation player too~"  
  
Even Miranda-san… I've been wondering where the first-generation players
were, but I never thought they were so close to me…  
  
"…Could it be that Nick-san from the armor shop is also one?"  
"Ah, that's right. He said he retired and started playing games just
like us."  
"Ahaha, he's not very talkative. I think it would have been even harder
to figure it out~"  
  
…Even Nick-san was a player… Wait, weren't almost all the people I met
in the town players?  
  
It feels like I've been in a group prank…  
  
"Ah, the Witch of the Forest of Death! She was a player!!"  
"Seriously? The potion seller was a player?!"  
  
…After that, I heard those words several times from people passing by. I
guess I can't say anything about other people…  
  
"But playing this game makes me remember a game I used to play. I think
it was 'Element Orb'."  
"Ah, I played it."  
  
Tetsu-san and Sunny-san were reminiscing.  
  
'Element Orb' is NR’s most famous game. It's not the kind where you
connect your mind to cyberspace. It's a VR game where you wear goggles
on your head and view images. It’s the first one to come out during that
era.  
  
The series is still ongoing and very popular as an offline VR game
software. I’ve played it myself.  
  
"It must have been amazing back then. It seems to have become a social
phenomenon…"  
"That's right, we didn't play games back then, but it was a topic of
conversation in the news, you know? We ended up buying it. …Then, my
husband got so hooked that he neglected the shop, so I had no choice but
to ban it."  
"...Thanks to that, I've been away from games until this age."  
  
That's how I was discussing games with Tetsu-san and the others for a
while. And then...  
  
"Hey, Kyle-san. How old is Element Orb now?"  
"I think it was its 20th anniversary last year. That VR movie was also
in the ceremony."  
  
I overheard Kyle-san's conversation… That's right, last year's movie,
which was shown in the city, was a commemorative movie for 'Element
Orb'.  
  
"It's a game from before I was born."  
"I wasn't born either."  
"Neither were we, Saval!"  
"I was too little back then, so I don't remember it."  
  
Tsubaki-san, Light-kun, Azi-chan and the others, and Miranda-san spoke
up… Everyone is surprisingly young… I think you have to be 13 or older
to use VR equipment. It varies by country and region, but they're
between 13 and 20 years old.  
  
“Hey, you guys, don’t go around revealing your age… Don’t drag me into
any trouble, okay?”  
  
Kyle-san cautioned them. Revealing one's real age isn't generally
recommended, especially for young people.  
  
“I didn’t come here to babysit…”  
“Yet you’re hanging around with Light-kun, aren’t you?”  
  
If he really hated dealing with kids, he would have cut ties with
Light-kun.  
  
“Ah, well… If I had a son, he’d probably be around that age. Then I
might have played games with him like this… I just can’t leave him
alone.”  
  
…I thought Kyle-san was old, but he seems even older than I imagined. A
hint of melancholy hung in the air around him as he looked at
Light-kun.  
  
“…Hey, isn’t that Rush-san over there?”  
“Oh, it’s you guys.”  
“My, my. Aren’t these Chloe-san and the others?”  
  
Rush-san and Friday-san passed in front of us in the center of the
plaza. It was surprising to see them here…  
  
“…Is it really so strange that we’re here?”  
  
Friday-san read my thoughts… Or maybe it was my expression. I couldn’t
help but stare at them.  
  
“Well, yeah.”  
“We’re waiting for Master.”  
“Master? …Come to think of it, I’ve never seen them before…”  
  
Friday-san had been in overall command during the recent battle, but he
had said he was the sub-master. Despite such a large-scale battle, I
haven't seen this Master even once.  
  
“Ah, our Master hasn’t been selected yet.”  
“What? Not selected yet… So, Master hasn’t even started playing SSO
yet!?”  
  
SSO still requires winning a lottery to play. To think that the key
Master wasn't even in the game…  
  
“Our Master passed the beta test. But he failed to get in during the
first wave… I was invited instead and got in.”  
“He failed the second wave too. But I got in.”  
  
...Master of El Dorado, you're out of luck.  
  
Beta testers didn’t have priority play rights when the official service
started. So, even beta testers couldn’t play unless they participated in
and won the first batch lottery.  
  
I think the recruitment rate for the first batch was quite low. The
pre-release buzz was lukewarm, and many beta testers didn't apply.  
  
The application rate barely reached the upper limit. So, I heard most
beta testers who applied were accepted… but it turns out some weren’t.
The second group’s application rate increased due to the commercials,
making it much harder to get in.  
  
…The third group is coming soon, so we’ll see what happens. Master, I
hope you make it...  
  
“Um…”  
“Is something the matter, Friday-san?”  
  
Friday-san kept looking at me for some reason. What’s wrong?  
  
“No, I just thought I should say something. Before that, Chloe-san, do
you see me as a man?”  
“Eh, yes, I do…”  
  
I unintentionally looked at Friday-san. No matter how you look at him,
he's a man... but maybe...  
  
"...Could it be that you're a woman?"  
“Yes, actually, I am.”  
  
The voice she has is very low and masculine. Definitely not female. And
no matter how you look at it, she looks completely male. But Friday-san
is indeed female.  
  
“I’m using a male character, so I expected to be mistaken. But I thought
it would be better to clear up any misunderstandings. I’m not doing
anything inappropriate…”  
“Yes, I understand.”  
“Thank you.”  
  
She gave a gentle smile in return. I thought she was a gentle person...
was that because her feminine side was coming out? She said she uses a
male avatar because she prefers a different persona from her usual
self.  
  
“Ooh, that’s the gold-plated guy from that time!”  
  
It was Azi-chan who came up to me and said that.  
  
"So Chloe-san's 'Beat-to-Death Squad' is back together, huh?!"  
"...Beat-to-death Squad?"  
“Is that even a thing?”  
“Wait, is that a thing?”  
  
That's what Light-kun, Rush-san, and I replied to Azi-chan.  
  
“You… you actually understand this reference!? …Aren’t there a lot of
Japanese people here? When did this server become a Japanese server,
Saval!”  
“Azi, the fact that we're here means it's at least an Asian server.”  
  
Unfortunately, as far as I’m concerned, it’s a world server. …But, it’s
true that the victims have gathered again.  
  
"Ah, it looks like Master has arrived."  
“Okay, then we’ll go to Master’s place… Wait. Hey, you, miss!”  
  
When Rush-san noticed Miranda-san, he ran towards her.  
  
“Oh, it’s the onii-san from the other day! Thank you so much from the
bottom of my heart then, thanks to you, Klin was saved~!"  
“I merely repaid a debt. …I should thank you too. Thanks to you, I was
able to return to my clan. …I'll properly thank you another time.”  
“Really? I’m looking forward to that~”  
  
Miranda-san said with a cheerful smile. …I bet she’ll make him buy
something when he goes to thank her.  
  
“—Hello, Chloe. I never thought I’d run into you here.”  
“…That voice…”  
  
I turned around at the irritating voice and saw a man about my height,
wearing red from head to toe - Ignis. The color of the circle around him
is green. …So he was a player after all.  
  
“Ahaha, don’t glare at me with such scary eyes. This is the City of
Illusions. You and I are both just dream forms cast by illusions, you
know?"  
“Even though you’re exactly the same as usual. I heard that some people
act differently here?”  
“But you’re just the same as always. I’m the same wherever I am. So—”  
  
I was about to hear what he was going to say, but a loud voice
interrupted him, distracting me. Because—  
  
"Now, now, please stretch your ears a bit and listen! Are there any of
you who are stressed out in your daily lives? At work, school, home… all
that stress and frustration… wouldn't you like to release all those
emotions and engage in some destructive activities to your heart's
content? Our evil organization, the \[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\], is
recruiting! Come join us and bring destruction and Chaos to the
world!”  
  
……That voice is incredibly familiar. I wanted to think it was my
imagination, but when I looked in the direction of the sound, I saw a
small child in a red hood handing out electronic flyers while shouting a
recruitment speech.  
  
“…”  
"Hey, what's that thing behind you? Are you saying that's an illusion
too?"  
“What are you talking about? I can’t see anything?”  
  
Well, you are facing away, so you wouldn’t see it. But you should be
able to hear the voice.  
  
“Oh, honey! What are you slacking off for? I told you to attract
customers properly, didn't I? Here, hold this sign!”  
  
The small child in a hood… no matter how you look at it, it’s Poco-chan.
She noticed me and approached, handing Ignis an electronic sign that
read, ‘Crimson Apostles of Chaos Recruiting!!’  
  
“…Ugh! Can’t you read the room at all!?”  
“What do you mean? Oh, isn't this Chloe-san? I'm sorry about that."  
  
Poco-chan laughed mischievously. It was clearly intentional, this shady
rabbit. By the way, Poco-chan also has a green circle around her, so
she's a player.
