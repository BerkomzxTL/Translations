# 87・Stop the Role

"Rush-san, why do you play games? Specifically, why do you play games
that don't suit you?"  
"W-well, that's obvious..."  
  
Miranda-san's assertive tone seemed to pressure Rush-san to speak.  
  
"I followed Master. He said he liked this game, so I started playing
it... But I didn't feel the same way. I mean, role-playing focused
games... there's unfair disparity between players... Frontier was the
perfect game—-"  
  
Rush-san, who had been speaking clearly, stopped abruptly as if he'd
just realized something.  
  
"...No, that's wrong. Even Frontier had job disparities and system
inconsistencies, and I was dissatisfied with that. It's a popular game,
but it certainly can't be called a perfect game... So why did I think it
was fun to play?"  
  
Apparently, Rush-san was dissatisfied with the system of Frontier, just
like with SSO. But even so, he continued playing Frontier… the reason
for that is unclear, it seems.  
  
"Do you understand why you enjoyed playing Frontier?"  
"Well, conquering dungeons, defeating strong boss enemies… and being
praised by other players for those accomplishments made me happy…"  
"Did you do all that alone?"  
"Of course not! How could I do it alone?! It was the glory we won
together with Master, Friday, and the clan members! The achievements and
honor we worked hard to gain were everything to me, the whole reason I
played Frontier!"  
"Really? Is that really the reason you played Frontier?"  
"……That's..."  
  
When Miranda-san asked again, Rush started thinking, and then he looked
like he finally understood.  
  
"……No. That's not it. Certainly, being praised by someone feels nice.
But that’s not it. I… when I failed with my clanmates, and then we tried
again, and our efforts were acknowledged and recorded... that's what
made me happiest… Yes, I actually didn't care about records or honor at
all!"  
  
Clenching his fist, he continued, as if letting out feelings he hadn't
realized until now.  
  
"That's right, it was like that from the beginning! I complained about
the system's flaws, grumbled about enemies I couldn't defeat, said the
game was garbage... and still, still, that game was fun! The reason I
could think that was because Master and Friday were there. The whole
reason I play games is to play with those guys!"  
  
Playing games with someone has a different kind of fun than playing
alone. For some, it's irreplaceable. For Rush-san, playing with
Master-san, Friday-san, and the others is the most fun and irreplaceable
thing of all.  
  
I think that wouldn't have changed no matter what game he played. It's
just that Rush-san, clinging to the achievements and honor he'd gained,
had forgotten that feeling.  
  
"The same goes for last time. I… I wanted to make our presence known
even in a game I was playing for the first time… I wanted achievements I
could brag about quickly… I wanted them to praise me… I wanted them to
be happy… and I rushed ahead and failed… Argh, damn it! What am I
doing?!"  
  
He spat out those words and covered his face with his hands, hanging his
head.  
  
"……What should I do? If I get kicked out, I won't have anywhere else to
go…. That was my home… the only place I know…. Even if I go back to
Frontier now, it'll be garbage if they're not there… I won’t enjoy
it…"  
  
The gravity of his situation seems profound, and Rush-san's voice
trembled.  
  
"It's okay. Now that you've realized that, I’m sure Friday-san will
forgive you."  
"……Really?"  
"Yes, yes, snap out of it! You're a member of a famous clan, aren't
you?"  
  
Patting his back, which was hunched over despite his large stature,
Miranda-san encouraged him.  
  
"……I think so too. I think Friday-san expelled you to make you wake
up."  
  
I think Friday-san wanted him to realize this. But it probably wouldn't
have gotten through even if he said it directly.  
  
"Either way, if you want to return to that clan again, you need to talk
to them…. Well, be prepared to talk. If you run away here, you’ll never
be able to face them."  
"……Yeah, that's right."  
  
Rush-san answered, surprised by Kyle-san's tone.  
  
"……Hey."  
"What’s up?"  
  
He hesitated for a moment about whether or not to say it, and then,
looking a bit embarrassed, he spoke.  
  
"……It might be too late, but I'm sorry for insulting you guys. I might
have been harsh on you because I remembered a troublesome role-player
from the previous game. …I must have had prejudices too. I thought
things like, 'What are you doing with this meaningless charade'…"  
"Ah—that's mutual. On our part, even though I had character and
game-related reasons for the previous incident, we did steal your
prey…"  
  
In SSO, the act of stealing someone else's target isn't necessarily
considered bad manners if there are game or character-related reasons,
but in other games, it's a clear breach of etiquette.  
  
"Alright, alright… is this okay for now?"  
"Miranda-san."  
"Ah, Chloe-chan. Sorry, I surprised you suddenly."  
  
Her speech and atmosphere seem like the usual Miranda-san… but it feels
slightly different. Is it because her player-like qualities are
showing?  
  
"Well, I was surprised… but I couldn't tell if you were a player or an
NPC."  
"Hehe, to hear you say that makes all the effort worth it… but this time
I couldn't bear to watch so I stopped role-playing…"  
  
Miranda-san said that while watching Rush-san talk with Kyle-san and the
others.  
  
"I love this game, and I didn't want him to have bad memories from it.
Because games are meant to be enjoyed, right? So, as a gamer, I couldn't
ignore his problem."  
  
Miranda-san said this with a smile, showing her face as a player.
Certainly, if she had left it alone, he might have ended up with bad
memories of the game and drifted away.  
  
"Now, I just hope Friday-san will forgive him…"  
"I agree."  
  
If this doesn’t bring him forgiveness… will he ever be able to recover
from it?  
  
"……Then, I'm going to see Friday."  
"Alright, I hope you two make up, you flashy guy!"  
"Good luck!"  
  
Encouraged by Light-kun and Oliver-kun, Rush-san started walking towards
Friday-san… but stopped halfway.  
  
"What's wrong? Aren't you going?"  
"Of course I'm going! Yeah, I'm going, I'm going to Friday's place!"  
  
He said it, but his feet aren’t moving. Then he glanced at us standing
behind him.  
  
"………"  
"………"  
"Maybe you can't go by yourself?"  
"That’s not it."  
"Then just go. We need to go search for Klin—"  
"……Ah, no, wait! Wait!"  
  
Rush-san hurried back.  
  
"You guys said Friday would forgive me? What if he doesn't?"  
"If that happens, it's just because you behaved badly. You deserve it.
Just give up completely."  
“…I thought you were a kind person, but you’re actually quite cold! …No,
was that just role-playing?!”  
  
Without answering his last question, I just smiled back.  
  
…Really, Rush-san is a troublesome person. He's just that scared of
being rejected by Friday-san and the others.  
  
"……Very well then. I'll go with you."  
  
Chloe doesn't have a role at the moment. I feel like I should search for
Klin-kun, but… the client is giving me a look that says it's alright.
They have an important role to play in establishing a base here in this
shelter, after all.  
  
"No, I didn't say I wanted you to come with me? Did I?"  
"Yes, yes, I'm just going to see Friday-san because I'm curious about
the details of the Willamedes subjugation operation. I don't care if
you're not forgiven by Friday-san."  
  
We split up, each with our own goals, and I headed towards Friday-san,
pulling the slow-moving Rush-san along.  
  
  
  
We found Friday-san and the others quickly. From the best vantage point
in the mansion, he seemed to be talking to several people outside the
clan and giving instructions.  
  
"……Rush, what is it? You’re no longer a clan member."  
  
Friday-san, noticing us, gave Rush-san a stern glare.  
  
"Friday! Please let me back into the clan!"  
  
Rush-san bowed his head vigorously.  
  
"I was able to enjoy playing that game because Master and Friday were
there. Playing without you guys isn't fun at all. I… I want to keep
playing games with you guys. I don't need achievements or honor, those
things aren't necessary to play with you guys! If the game we're going
to play is SSO, I'll play according to your instructions, according to
SSO's game specifications. …I won't force myself, I'll quit if it really
doesn't suit me. But if I play with you guys, that might change… so!"  
  
Rush-san raised his head and looked straight at Friday-san.  
  
"Please, let me back into El Dorado…!"  
  
Seriously, earnestly. He poured out his feelings for his clanmates.
Seeing Rush-san like that, Friday-san's stern expression softened, and
his gaze became gentler.  
  
"Yes, that's right. The most important thing is to play games purely for
the sake of enjoying them with your friends. Of course, while being
considerate of other players playing the same game. ...You're really
late in realizing that."  
"Friday…"  
"Welcome back to the new El Dorado, Rush. We welcome you."  
"……! Ah!"  
  
A notification of his acceptance must have arrived. Rush-san seemed to
be pressing the button for the notification as his hand moved. His
expression is very happy, and he's slightly teary-eyed.  
  
"It seems like you took good care of him. I'm sorry for the trouble...
but it's true that thanks to that, Rush was able to return so quickly.
Thank you."  
"No, no …It seems like you waited for him to realize it on his own."  
"Rather than me explaining everything from the beginning, I thought it
would be easier for him to understand if I took action and was rough
with him like this."  
  
Friday-san replied with a gentle smile. I’m sure he’s explained it many
times, but Rush-san probably didn't listen much. That's why he took such
drastic measures this time…. There might have been other ways, but since
it was Friday-san, who seems to have a long relationship with him, this
might have been the only option.  
  
"Well then… the new El Dorado's first big task has already begun. Of
course, the target is—the subjugation of Willamedes."  
  
With the same smile, Friday-san narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at
Willamedes rampaging in the town; like a hunter looking at his prey.
