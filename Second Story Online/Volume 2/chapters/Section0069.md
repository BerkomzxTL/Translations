# 69・Mining Town

"Get out of my sight!"  
  
I unleashed a \[Shadow Arrow\] at the firefly-like insect that was
approaching me. The firefly monster, with low remaining HP, fell with
that single blow.  
  
"Looks like that one's done too~"  
  
Miranda-san, who had been fighting another monster, returned. Seeing her
recovering with the potion I gave her earlier, it seems she took a few
hits.  
  
"Are you alright?"  
"I got a little careless… but I'm fine now thanks to Chloe-chan's
potion! …Still, it's amazingly effective, do you use some special method
for making them~?"  
"……No, no, nothing special at all. It's a completely normal recipe."  
  
…Though I do use lake water as a special ingredient. Honestly, I can't
let my guard down when Miranda-san puts on her merchant face.  
  
Surprisingly, her weapon is a hammer. In these \[Iru Mines\], there are
\[Stone Rollers\], the same as the ones in the \[Gouro Mountain Pass\].
The sight of her smashing the rock-covered Stone Rollers with her hammer
is quite unlike the Miranda-san I usually see.  
  
It seems her past as a traveling merchant is true. However, she herself
says she isn't very good at fighting.  
  
"I was able to hit them because Chloe-chan kept the enemies occupied~. I
wouldn't have hit anything at all if I'd been doing it alone~."  
  
That's what she said during our first battle. Part of it is probably
because she uses a hammer, which is hard to hit with… but she says she
uses it because it gives her the most firepower. If you prioritize
firepower, I guess it can't be helped. I don't think it's worth it if
you can't hit anything, but firepower is important. Yes.  
  
She usually tries to avoid enemies as much as possible. She normally
carries \[Holy Water\] and a \[protective amulet\], of course, but
Klin-kun has them now. That's why she seemed worried about going alone
this time.  
  
Together with Miranda-san, I started walking toward the mining town. The
\[Iru Tunnel\], located in the \[Iru Mines\] region, is a place where
natural caves and man-made paths intersect. It's dimly lit, but luminous
stones that react to the magical energy in the air illuminate the
passage, so there's no need to worry about light sources like torches.  
  
Though I have \[Night Vision\], so I don't need light… However, the
firefly monsters we fought earlier used \[Flash\]. It seems the effect
is amplified for those with \[Night Vision\], so I was surprised to
receive extra damage on top of the blinding effect.  
  
When Niru almost fell to the ground after being hit by the Flash, Earl
skillfully caught him. …He's really good at catching things.  
  
Still, among the players who came through the dark \[Twilight Forest\],
there must have been some who, like me, obtained night vision. It was
like a trap designed to target them, and I fell for it perfectly.  
  
That aside. This tunnel is indeed dimly lit, but unlike the Twilight
Forest, it’s not just dark; the soft light of the luminous stones
creates a fantastical atmosphere. While admiring the scenery, I had a
sudden thought.  
  
"Since it's a mine, does that mean there's ore somewhere?"  
"Hmm… I don't think there's any here~? This is more like a connecting
route between the Iru Mining Town and Dairode Town."  
  
That's a bit disappointing. So it's not so easy to find, is it?  
  
*‘Even if you find raw ore, it’s not usable as is.’*  
*‘That's true… but isn't there a certain romantic appeal to finding
some?’*  
  
I said that to Lucille-san, who was perched on Earl's shoulder.  
  
*‘I suppose I understand that. …Ah, that’s right. If you want it so
badly, you could try defeating a Stone Roller with a beautiful shell.
Those monsters’ main food is stone and rock, but they particularly love
ore. The ore they eat becomes their protective shell, and if the ore is
a gemstone, it’ll create a truly beautiful shell. If you ever run into a
Stone Roller with a beautiful shell, you should try defeating it.’*  
  
I'd really like to see that. If the shell is formed from the ore it
eats, it must be beautiful, don't you think? Besides, defeating it might
give us the ore.  
  
*‘But those kinds of individuals are usually affected by the power of
the ore they’ve eaten, so they won’t be easy to defeat.’*  
*‘Really? We won’t know if we can defeat it until we try, right?’*  
*‘Kakaka, if you say so. Then I’ll look forward to that time.’*  
  
Lucille-san responded playfully to my assertive statement.  
  
"Look! I can see the exit!"  
  
As I was talking to Lucille-san, it seems we reached the exit.  
  
Miranda-san ran towards where a light was coming from in the distance. I
quickly followed her and left the dark tunnel.  
  
"Wow…"  
  
After my eyes adjusted to the light, a new sight spread before me.  
  
In the middle of the mountainous region, a circular hole, like a crater,
suddenly opened up. Tiered levels descending towards the center,
resembling a staircase, were lined with sturdy houses, and people could
be seen coming and going.  
  
Gondola lifts passed overhead like clouds. Some gondolas carried people,
while others carried mined stones coming up from underground.  
  
"Is this the Iru Mines?"  
"Yes, that’s right~. It's your first time seeing it, Chloe-chan! Isn't
it amazing~?"  
  
Miranda-san, too, was enjoying the scenery. Beside her, Earl is even
more excited than us.  
  
*‘Hmm, it’s been a while since I saw this scenery, but it's still
magnificent.’*  
  
Lucille-san, from atop Earl's shoulder, was also enjoying the view.
Perhaps the only one who isn't enjoying it is Niru. It isn't that he's
not enjoying it, but rather that he isn't interested. He's asleep on my
shoulder, avoiding the light.  
  
It had been dark inside the tunnel earlier, so he was energetic despite
it being daytime, but he got like this as soon as we came outside.
Truly, that's Niru for you.  
  
"It's nice to see this view… but let's get going, shall we?"  
"Yeah~. We need to find Klin quickly!"  
  
I thought we might run into him on the way, but we didn't. That means he
might still be in town.  
  
Our current location is a hill slightly away from the town. To get
there, it seems best to go to the gondola station a little further away
and take the lift.  
  
As we walked along the path leading there, I realized Earl wasn't
following us.  
  
"Earl, let's go!"  
  
Finally noticing my call, Earl hurried to catch up. Let's take a look
around on the way back.  
  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
  
\[Duo Region/Iru Mining Town\]  
  
We've arrived at the Iru Mining Town. This is the second town that
players who started in Dairode Town will see. Dairode Town felt like it
was plopped down in the middle of a grassland, but this one was built
inside a valley-like crater in the mountains. Since it’s surrounded by
mountains, the sky looks like it’s been cut out into a circle when you
look up.  
  
Because it's a mining town, many craftsmen who process mined ore live
here. Some craftsmen players seem to base themselves in this town.  
  
Now, we are currently in a corner of the town. We’ve come to the
artisan's district. Of course, it's to look for Klin-kun. Klin-kun's
purpose was to pick up some urgent goods. We visited the merchant who
handled those goods…  
  
"Klin? Ah, he came to my shop yesterday to pick them up."  
"Really? Klin came here to get them!?"  
"Yes, it's true. He said he was going back to Dairode Town immediately.
He said it was because you would be worried."  
"I see…"  
  
Apparently, Klin-kun had safely arrived and visited the shop.
Miranda-san looked anxious.  
  
"Do you know anything about where Klin-kun might be?"  
"I'm sorry, I don't know that much… but, well, maybe..."  
"You know something?"  
  
The merchant, who seemed to be hesitating whether to say it or not,
opened his mouth after a short pause.  
  
"Well… on the day Klin visited my shop… there was an incident where
someone with a knife went on a rampage in the back alleys. It's been
happening a lot lately… these kinds of incidents. Luckily, only one
person was injured, but that injured person might have been Klin."  
"I see… I understand. We'll go check to see if it's him."  
  
Leaving the merchant, we decided to go and check on the injured
person.  
  
"Are you sure it's Klin-kun?"  
"……Klin is quite strong despite his appearance. So, maybe it's not him,
but…"  
  
Miranda-san said this, but her tone was hesitant. It might not be him,
but if it is, we need to go and pick him up. Even if it's not, if the
merchant's story is true, he might have been involved in another
incident.  
  
The place we're going to is the town guard's office. There, we can get
information about the injured person, and we might also find clues to
Klin-kun's whereabouts.  
  
"Wait aaaah, you thieveeessss!"  
  
As we were walking towards the guard's office, we suddenly heard someone
shouting from behind. Turning around in surprise, we saw three people
running toward us, followed by a young boy.  
  
"Chloe-chan! We can't leave thieves alone, we have to catch them!"  
  
Miranda-san, as a merchant who handles goods, can’t tolerate thieves,
and pointed at the group running towards us.  
  
"Yes, of course."  
  
Even Chloe couldn't ignore this. I used \[Wind Cutter\] to stop them.  
  
"Whoa!"  
  
The cat-eared girl in the lead was surprised by my magic and stopped
abruptly. She lost her balance and fell on her bottom. The other two,
who seemed to be her companions, also stopped.  
  
"What are you doing!? That's dangerous!"  
"Well, I'm sorry. I heard someone saying there were thieves, and my
magic accidentally came out. Are you injured?"  
"Huh? Um, well, I'm fine because it didn't hit me… wait, you!?"  
  
The cat-eared girl, still sitting on the ground, responded with a blank
expression to my words, but then her expression changed suddenly. Seeing
her face, I remembered too.  
  
"Oh, you're the…"  
"Uwaaaaah, the terrifying witch from before!? Why are you here!?"  
  
The cat-eared girl hurriedly got up and hid behind her companion… a tall
elf man.  
  
"Yu―― no, Saval! Saval! It’s terrible, the witch from before is here!"  
"I understand, calm down, Azi. We're on the run, after all, you know?"  
"But what if it turns out like last time!? Hey, Bluey?"  
"Indeed, that’s true. Wow~ I never thought we’d meet again here~."  
"This isn’t the time to be so carefree…"  
  
The three thieves: a cat-eared girl, a tall elf, and a small dwarf. This
isn't the first time I've encountered them. They're the same trio of
bandits who attacked me in the \[Twilight Forest\] before.
