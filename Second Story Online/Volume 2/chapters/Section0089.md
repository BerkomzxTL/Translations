# 89・Subjugation Operation

*‘Willamedes, five minutes until arrival at the target location. Is the
shield destruction team ready?’*  
*‘This is the destruction team. Everyone is assembled.’*  
  
I responded to Friday-san’s call over comms. A little time has passed
since then. The conversation with the lord went smoothly, and the quest
was issued through the guard corps. The players who received it worked
well, weakening the Red Hood group’s movements.  
  
The issued quest included El Dorado’s name. Even though it was via an
NPC, El Dorado is actually leading the operation.  
  
“Please include our names. Thanks to the quests and the NPCs, our
instructions have been downgraded to the point where they seem like
indirect requests, so players will be more accepting than if we issued
direct orders. However… we are definitely not shadowy masterminds
secretly pulling strings from behind the scenes. Let's do this openly
with our heads held high.”  
  
Friday-san said that while writing the quest request details.  
  
…Certainly, if it hadn't be written down, it would have just looked like
a request from an NPC. If it gets revealed later, it could be
interpreted as using players as pawns.  
  
Thanks to the other players who accepted the quest with that in mind,
the current situation is looking more favorable for us… but, I can't
really say that until we defeat Willamedes, the biggest problem.  
  
“Wow… this view is amazing!”  
“It really is. To see this many people lined up… it's quite a sight."  
  
Azi-chan and Bluey-kun, who were near me, looked out at the gondola
station.  
More than 50 people lined up at the gondola station. They are the
Willamedes shield destruction team.  
  
Most of them have long-range attacks. When Willamedes approaches,
they'll unleash a simultaneous attack from here. I was asked to take
charge.  
  
“You guys stay back. You’re not at your best yet, and what if you get
caught in the attack and die? The area around the \[Star Stele\] is a
hellish scene right now.”  
"I know that without you having to tell me!"  
“For the time being, I can use my resurrection magic, so it’s okay even
if you get fatally wounded.”  
  
Following Saval-kun’s warning, Azi-chan and the others moved back. I
invited Saval-kun, an archer who was in the shelter, as part of the
shield destruction team, and the two of them came along.  
  
Lucille-san and Niru are also here, but I left Earl with Miranda-san.
Because of the penalty he’s under, I didn’t want to push him too hard.  
  
*‘Please help Miranda-san. That’s your job.’*  
  
He seemed to be apologetic for not being able to help me, so I said that
to him. I’m sure he’s helping Miranda-san with resident care and
replenishing potions right now.  
  
Currently, Willamedes is moving through the central part of the town.
The target, of course, is the \[Star Stele\]. It seems that players who
have died and returned by death and the Red Hood gang are clashing
around the \[Star Stele\], so the players who haven’t died yet are being
warned not to approach it.  
  
At the same time, there’s also a warning not to die needlessly, and if
you do die, it’s recommended to report it to a healer immediately for
resurrection.  
  
If you resurrect from the \[Star Stele\], you get a death penalty. It
takes an hour to remove that…and that reduces our fighting force by that
much.  
  
“Three minutes until arrival at the target! Everyone, please start
preparing!”  
  
The assembled members began getting ready at my call.  
  
“Then, let’s get ready too! Chloe-san, are you ready?”  
“Yes, please do so when I give the signal. I’ve entrusted HP management
to Bluey-kun.”  
“Yes, I’ll make sure you don’t die.”  
  
We’ve formed a party again. This is because my skills and their
abilities complement each other… and because we have a plan to challenge
our limits together.  
  
“I’ll find the weak point, so aim carefully!”  
  
Saval-kun nocked an arrow. Now… is it about time? I look at the demonic
beast Willamedes ascending the stair-like streets.  
  
The gondola station is high up, but it’s only here that we are at eye
level with Willamedes. Besides its enormous size, if you were on the
ground, you’d be crushed under its feet.  
  
The players fighting on the ground are avoiding its feet, attacking from
building rooftops, and those who can fly are attacking from the air.
There seem to be bird-people among the beastfolk.  
  
It’s become completely night, and dozens of winged humans are flying
around in the starry sky.  
  
“This is the guidance team! We have successfully guided Willamedes.
Thirty seconds until the guidance teams and other players have
evacuated!”  
  
Rush-san’s voice came through. A group chat for important leaders,
including myself, to communicate has been set up. I’m using this to talk
with Rush-san and Friday-san.  
  
“Starting the countdown. After it finishes, please launch a simultaneous
attack. Even if players are left behind, proceed without hesitation.”  
“Understood.”  
  
Attacks by players not in a party are still effective. If you’re around
Willamedes, you’ll be caught in the crossfire.  
  
“Twenty seconds! Azi-chan, please!”  
“Got it! Then I’ll go ahead and use… \[Armor Break\]! \[Magic Armor
Break\]! \[Power Break\]!”  
  
Azi-chan, the only one who has been excluded from the party, started
attacking me. It’s not out of spite for being left out… I asked her to
do this. Also, Azi-chan still has a death penalty, so her attack power
is quite low.  
  
However, I received \[Defense Down\], \[Magic Defense Down\], and
\[Attack Down\] status ailments from her attacks. Truly, short swords
are called the best for disruptive attacks for a reason.  
  
“…Found it. I’ve found the weak point. Can you see it too?”  
“Yes, thanks to Saval-kun, I can see it clearly.”  
  
When you’re in a party, you can share information with your allies.
Saval-kun can apparently find the enemy’s weak points, and a mark
indicating the weak spot appeared on the shield.  
  
Apparently, El Dorado’s team found this weak point beforehand, but even
when they told us, we couldn’t see it. Only now, when it’s been
visualized, can we see where it is.  
  
“Ten seconds!”  
  
Some people are already chanting magic. I also started chanting my own
magic. At the same time, I drank cold medicine and inflicted the
\[Cold\] status ailment. I also scattered \[Fine Sand\] and inflicted
\[Blindness\]. Niru is handling visibility, so it's okay.  
  
This makes five status ailments. Don't you think that's still not
enough? Last time, my maximum was seven.  
  
I took out what I had prepared… Yes, it’s \[Dark Soup\]. Of the several
I've made, this is an excellent soup that inflicts seven status
ailments, having had resistant poisons and such removed.  
  
I managed to drink the soup, which was still as bad as ever. The
following status ailments were added to the list: \[Stomach Ache\],
\[High Fever\], \[Weakness\], \[Frailty\], \[Slowness\], \[Dizziness\],
and \[Food Ineffective\].  
  
This brings the total number of abnormal statuses to twelve!  
  
“What is this!? There's something strange about the way the HP bar is
decreasing!"  
“Bluey, it’s collapsing, it’s collapsing!”  
  
Saval-kun, while aiming his bow, warned Bluey-kun about his flustered
remark. Bluey-kun hurriedly recovered my HP, which was about to enter
the red zone. As expected of a healer. Now I don't have to worry about
dying.  
  
“…3, 2, 1! Simultaneous attack, commence!!”  
  
At the signal, everyone present unleashed every attack they had on the
approaching Willamedes.  
  
The unleashed attacks crashed into Willamedes’ shield as a brilliant
mass of rainbow light. A thunderous roar and explosion followed after.  
  
"GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"  
  
A sound like shattering glass resounded amidst the roar. At the same
time, the shield protecting Willamedes shattered, and the mass of
rainbows hit its huge body.  
  
“Whoa, that’s amazing!”  
"I felt like I could see the magnitude of the serious damage..."  
“This is undeniably a romantic bombardment… I got to see something
amazing.”  
  
Unlike Azi-chan, who is purely excited, Saval-kun looks slightly
withdrawn, and Bluey-kun is gazing with shining eyes. …Saval-kun and
Bluey-kun’s reaction is definitely to my magic damage. The numbers were
certainly strange. But, that power was also thanks to you two, right?  
  
“This is the destruction team, we’ve succeeded in destroying the
shield!”  
“Confirmed here. …We are now proceeding to the next phase. Commencing
the Willamedes subjugation operation. Each team, commence attacks on
Willamedes. Suppression team, please continue to deal with the
troublesome Red Hood group.”  
  
Friday-san’s instructions were given via comms. The destruction team
members also began moving to positions to subjugate Willamedes.  
  
“Oh! Yeah, death penalty lifted!”  
"...I thought for sure it would stay like this until the end."  
“Well, that’s good. Now both of us can join in."  
  
The two whose roles were broken returned to their original characters in
response to Azi-chan.  
More than an hour has passed since then... Time flies, doesn't it?  
  
“Then we’re participating in the subjugation too. It would be a waste
not to participate in such a festive event!”  
“Hey, Azi! Don’t charge in alone!”  
  
Saval-kun chased after Azi-chan, who has dashed off towards
Willamedes.  
  
“Chloe-san is…”  
“I’m here. I’m still not feeling well after what just happened…”  
  
Bluey-kun removed all my status ailments, but I’m still feeling sick
from the aftereffects of dizziness and blurred vision.  
  
“Understood.”  
“Yes, thank you for the recovery.”  
  
Bluey-kun ran off after them. At the same time, the party disbanded. I
guess they’re reforming a three-person party.  
  
“It’s not something you should do if you’re not used to it…”  
“You’ve worked hard. Leave Willamedes to the others, you should rest.”  
  
Lucille-san showed concern for me as I sat down.  
  
I was dizzy, but I'm also mentally exhausted. I’ve never taken charge of
so many people before…  
  
Come to think of it, Earl gave me a drink as we were parting. I wonder
when he prepared it... It looks like clear water... it's lake water. So
he prepared it before we came here?  
  
When I drank it, it had a cool, refreshing citrus flavor that soothed my
tired throat and heart. …Earl, you’ve been very helpful.  
  
“The attack just now was amazing! It was truly a simultaneous attack
combining everyone’s power!”  
“C…cough!?”  
  
I choked at the unbelievable voice. Why… why are you here!?  
  
“Hey, Chloe. Nice to see you again!”  
  
Cheerfully waving his hand is the familiar boy with red hair and a red
robe… I’m so sick of seeing him.
