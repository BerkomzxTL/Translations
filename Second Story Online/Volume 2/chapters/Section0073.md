# 73・Little Reaper

"Is this the house?"  
"Yes, it's a little close to the back alley..."  
  
Following Poco-chan's directions, we left the bustling main road at dusk
and walked down a narrow path lined with houses. Perhaps due to the
shadows cast by the buildings, this area felt dark. As a dark magic
user, I’m grateful there’s so much shadow, though.  
  
*'……Chloe, I just heard a scream.'*  
*'Eh?'*  
  
Lucille-san murmured. I hadn't heard anything yet. However, after
walking a while...  
  
"He-help! Someone, please help meeee——!!!"  
  
Just as Lucille-san said, I heard a person scream. Could it be…?  
  
"Chloe, I'm counting on you to look after the girls. Light, let's go!"  
"Right!"  
  
Kyle-san and Light-kun reacted immediately to the scream. They ran
towards the source, leaving us behind.  
  
"Chloe-san… maybe it's her…"  
"It's alright, Poco-chan."  
  
I reassured the frightened Poco-chan, and then we followed after
Kyle-san.  
  
"Uaaaaah——!!"  
"Stop it!"  
  
I heard another human scream, followed by Kyle-san's shout to stop them.
Following the sound, we ran down the path and arrived at the scene. Five
people had collapsed in various places along the narrow street.  
  
"You!!"  
"Oh, it's the onii-san from that time! And the onee-san too. Lily never
thought Lily would see you again, I'm so happy~!"  
  
The voice was clearly that of a young girl. Her appearance matched that
of an immature girl. Her revealing outfit was strangely at odds with her
small, bat-like black wings. A demon with pink hair and goat-like
horns.  
  
In the center of the fallen people was the demon we met in the
village—Lily-chan.  
  
"A demon… a worthy opponent for me!"  
  
Light-kun attacked with a slash, but she avoided it with a backward
leap.  
  
"How mean! To attack such a frail girl…"  
"I can't stand that coming from you, you're attacking people!"  
"……Who are you?"  
"Hmph… I am the hero Light. The one who will save this world and bring
hope—"  
"A hero? No way! You don't look like a hero at all."  
  
Lily-chan mercilessly shot down Light-kun, who was trying to strike a
heroic pose and introduce himself.  
  
"Where's your star? A Star Bearer (hero) should have their own star,
right?"  
"……I'm strong enough even without a Star Sword."  
  
Not a holy sword, but a Star Sword? …Ah, I think that's a reference to
the Star Gods?  
This is no good. My knowledge of the official world setting isn't
enough.  
  
This game apparently has settings that you can only learn by reading
in-game books, talking to people, or even by taking on special roles, so
there's a significant information gap among players regarding the world
settings.  
  
"Ahaha, how ridiculous to claim to be a hero without a star!"  
"Shut up! I'm a hero no matter what anyone says!"  
  
Light-kun, whose hero's sword was stolen during an incident, has nothing
to prove his heroism… He looks a little pitiful.  
  
"……You… I heard you took Klin away. Where is Klin? Answer me!"  
  
Miranda-san glared at Lily-chan. Her hands were shaking as she clutched
the edge of her clothes, probably from nervousness and anxiety.  
  
"Klin? Who's that?"  
  
Lily-chan, drawn to Miranda-san's voice, turned her gaze towards us.
Despite being surrounded, her expression was impishly cheerful.  
  
"……I heard that you kidnapped Klin-kun, do you remember that?"  
  
I asked Lily-chan while holding my staff defensively to protect
Poco-chan, who was behind Miranda-san and me.  
  
"Sorry, but I haven't kidnapped any humans."  
"That's a lie, I saw it with my own eyes! I saw you kidnap that boy!"  
  
Poco-chan shouted as she hid behind me.  
  
"Huh? Maybe you're seeing things wrong? You're the liar. Lily hasn't
kidnapped anyone!"  
  
Lily-chan strongly asserted herself as she slammed the handle of her
scythe into the ground. Could it be that Lily-chan really didn't kidnap
Klin-kun…?  
  
"Then what were you doing here? You attacked them, didn't you?"  
  
Kyle-san asked Lily with a harsh expression.  
  
"Obviously, it’s because they got in Lily's way. If you guys also try to
get in Lily's way, Lily won't show any mercy."  
  
In the dim shadows, the small demon stood with her scythe poised. It was
as if a small reaper stood there.  
  
"And I want to get back at you for what happened last time."  
  
If it weren't for her incongruous wings and horns, her girlish
appearance and smiling face would look pure and innocent. We were on
high alert for her large scythe, but…  
  
"Well, I’d like to say that... but I have someone else whose debt I want
to repay. They weren't among these guys, so I have to find them. I'll
let you guys go for now."  
"What?! I'm not going to let you get away!"  
"Bye bye, you still have a scary face as always!"  
  
When Kyle-san was told he had a scary face, he was startled and stopped
in his tracks. Lily-chan took the opportunity to fly away with her
wings, disappearing into the darkness.  
  
"No… where is Klin"  
"Calm down, we'll find her again and get his location…"  
  
Light-kun and Earl were trying to comfort Miranda-san, who had collapsed
to her knees.  
  
"Kyle-san."  
"Chloe…"  
  
I spoke to Kyle-san, who was standing with his face angled towards the
ground. His clenched fists were trembling. Was he feeling responsible
for letting her escape?  
  
"……Was my face really that scary?"  
"...For now, why don't you calm down as well?"  
  
Kyle-san's mask had started to slip, though not completely. But it's
completely gone now.  
  
"More importantly, we need to help the people who are lying around."  
"Ah… right."  
  
He nodded, his usual Kyle-san-like expression returning. Looking around,
five people were lying on the ground. They were dressed simply, like
ordinary residents. All of them seemed to have been attacked, with cuts
on their clothes. There was no blood. It seems that that kind of
depiction is kept to a minimum in this game.  
  
"Chloe, you take care of that one. I'll help these ones over here."  
  
As instructed, I approached a man lying on the ground. He was still
breathing and his body was warm, so he seemed to still be alive. His HP
was critical, bright red, so it didn’t change the fact that he was close
to death. He seemed to be in a state of unconsciousness.  
  
"Are you alright?"  
  
I used a potion to restore his HP and called out to him. Then he seemed
to wake up, and opened his eyes —My eyes met a pair of red eyes.  
  
"Aaah… AAAAAAH!!!"  
"Wh-what's wrong!?"  
  
He suddenly clutched his chest and began to writhe in pain. Why…? I only
gave him a potion…  
  
"Stop it, we're not your enemies!"  
"Damn it, what are these guys!?"  
  
I heard Kyle-san's panicked voice and turned around.  
In front of them were the four people who had collapsed on the side of
the road earlier. All four had red eyes and, as if possessed, were
attacking Kyle-san and the others.  
  
"Sorry!"  
  
Kyle-san dodged a punch from one of them, grabbed their arm, and
performed a powerful back throw. Even though it’s a game, I didn't know
he could do that…  
  
"Damn, that's cool! I wish I could do that!"  
  
As Light-kun himself said, he's not very good at hand-to-hand combat, so
he was a bit pushed back. But I think his movements are better than
mine. Just now he knocked someone down with a punch.  
  
"—!"  
  
I felt a hand grab my arm, and turned back. The man I had just given a
potion was holding my arm.  
  
"Chloe!"  
"No, I'm fine."  
  
Kyle-san, realizing the situation, ran to help, but I gently stopped
him.  
The man's expression had changed from agony to calmness, and his eyes
had turned black.  
  
"……Are you alright?"  
"Y-yes… thank… you."  
  
After replying, he closed his eyes as if losing consciousness. His
breathing was stable, so he seemed to be alright.  
  
"What exactly are they…"  
  
Kyle-san furrowed his brows in confusion.  
  
…Red eyes. I remember Lucille-san mentioning that it's a common
characteristic of the perpetrators of recent assault cases in this town.
To think that the perpetrators of the assault cases (red eyes) were
being attacked by the perpetrator of the assault cases (Lily)… What's
going on? And why did the person I gave a potion to suffer like that…?  
  
"Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?"  
"Light, did you figure something out?"  
  
I stopped my thoughts and looked at Light-kun. He looked around as if to
confirm his surroundings, then he spoke.  
  
"Maybe it has to do with the power of the hero… but I can feel the power
of Chaos from them."
