# 72・Center of Attention

"That's a big deal... I wonder if this is related to an epic quest..."  
  
Oliver-kun muttered to himself as we left the guard building. Indeed, I
had a similar feeling. This looks like it's shaping up to be an epic
quest.  
  
"...Is that so?"  
"I'm a craftsman in this town, you see. I knew something was going on in
town lately. I guess that was an omen."  
  
Oliver-kun responded to Light-kun's words. Perhaps because they weren't
pure role-players, they naturally continued the conversation as fellow
players.  
  
"...If you knew, why didn't you try to solve it? You might be able to
participate in an epic quest!"  
"I'm not really into that kind of thing... If I had to choose, I'd
rather just watch."  
"You're a strange guy. Not participating in an epic quest, the game's
biggest feature."  
  
Didn't Light-kun not know about epic quests when he started? Well, I
didn't either.  
  
"Really? I think there are a lot of players like me... Oh, a message."  
  
Oliver-kun then seemed to start a private chat, his mouth moving as he
spoke to someone far away.  
  
*'...Kyle-san, what do you think? Do you think this is an epic
quest?'*  
*'Who knows... Lately, the number of epic quests has exploded compared
to the early days. I can't say it isn't one.'*  
  
The Kyle-san who responded was not the usual Kyle-san, but the real
Kyle-san. It's been a while since I've seen this gap.  
  
*'By the way, Kyle-san, about the culprit who kidnapped Klin-kun...'*  
*'Ah, you're thinking it's the one from that time.'*  
*'You think so too?'*  
  
The physical characteristics resembled the demon that appeared that
time. Kyle-san, who was also there, also thought the culprit matched.  
  
*'Well, it does sound like her. But we won't know for sure until we
actually see her. Their characteristics might just be similar... But
even if it's someone else, we'll still have to defeat them.'*  
  
He laughed, but it was a sinister laugh no matter how you look at it.
Kyle-san, please role-play!  
  
"Hey, I'm going to go off on my own. You guys seem pretty busy over
there."  
  
Oliver-kun said that after ending his private call.  
  
"But are you alright with the thief situation?"  
"Ah, I just got a message and a friend of mine is going to help out. So
don't worry about that."  
  
We parted ways with Oliver-kun here. We have our own circumstances, and
it seems unlikely we could get involved with his affairs.  
  
"You absolutely have to catch that thief!"  
"Yeah, beat up those thieves and throw them in jail!"  
"Yeah, I know!"  
  
Oliver-kun answered energetically to Light-kun and Miranda-san.  
  
  
◇◇◇  
  
  
"Thank you all so much. To think you'd walk me home..."  
  
Poco-chan said that while bowing her head. We had decided to escort her
home. She's injured, and the culprit is still at large. Normally it
would’ve been the guard's job, but we took over instead.  
  
"We'll protect your safety, so please don't worry."  
"Yeah, I'm counting on you."  
  
The villainous look from earlier is gone. Now he looks like an honorable
knight serving a princess.  
  
"Of course, and your companion... Miranda was it?"  
"Huh? Ah, yeah, that's right~"  
  
Kyle-san unexpectedly spoke to Miranda-san, who was next to me. Kyle-san
approached us, or rather, Miranda-san, with a reassuring smile.  
  
"After escorting Poco-san, we'll hunt down that demon. I will definitely
rescue your companion and bring back your smile."  
  
Kyle-san took Miranda-san's hand and made a declaration like an oath.
...Was the princess over here?  
  
"Yes, thank you very much~"  
  
Miranda-san, as always, replied nonchalantly. Even with Kyle-san's
appearance, she doesn't seem embarrassed or shy, which is typical
Miranda-san.  
  
"...Ah, here we go again"  
  
Light-kun sighed at the sight. That's right, Kyle-san likes beautiful
women. To be precise, it's not Kyle-san, but the evil spirit.  
  
"Please, leave this to this Kyle."  
  
...Kyle-san looks like an earnest knight who has made an oath, so this
is quite troublesome. We can't exorcise the evil spirit like this.  
  
"Of course, I will protect Chloe as well."  
"Yes, thank you."  
  
…If evil spirits didn’t appear when he was with a woman, he would be the
perfect knight… Seeing this, Niru, perched on my shoulder, had a fierce
look in his eyes.  
  
"Hey, old man Kyle! Stop that and let's go already!"  
"I'm still an older brother, not an old man."  
  
No, that was definitely an old man. Although he hid it well with
role-playing. Don't skip your role-play at times like these!  
  
  
◇◇◇  
  
  
We are currently walking through the Iru mining town to see Poco-chan
off. There aren't a lot of people around. Even on the main streets that
are usually crowded, only a few people are walking now. Apparently, the
incidents that have been happening in town are the cause, and the number
of people going out has decreased.  
  
*'Lucille-san, what do you think about this incident?'*  
  
I spoke to Lucille-san, stealing glances away from Kyle-san and the
others walking ahead. It was a good opportunity since I've been avoiding
openly talking to her. I let Earl walk ahead of me, and I walked behind
him while talking to her.  
  
*'Well now. Until we understand the demon's purpose in attacking people
and kidnapping Klin-kun, I can't say anything.'*  
*'Is that so...'*  
  
I thought Lucille-san might have noticed something, but even she seemed
to lack information.  
  
*'But, I did see some interesting information at the guard station
earlier.'*  
*'...When did you get a hold of this?'*  
*'I snuck behind you guys when you were talking to see if there was
anything.'*  
*'That’s quite shrewd...'*  
  
I thought she was out of sight, but that's what she was up to.  
  
*'So, what's this interesting information?'*  
*'Ah, about the assault cases that have been happening in this town
recently. By the way, the culprit has practically been caught already.
Specifically, those cases were dealt with as commonplace causes like
drunkards or fights.'*  
*'What's so interesting about that? The culprit's already caught,
right?'*  
*'Yes, I suppose so. But it seems that the perpetrators share a common
characteristic.'*  
*'A characteristic?'*  
*'Yes, their eyes turned red, and they attacked people while going crazy
like they were possessed.'*  
*'...It doesn't sound like it was caused by drunkards or fights.'*  
*'It would cause a commotion if it was made public. I think they
deliberately kept it a secret.'*  
*'Coming from the secretive Lucille-san, that theory is quite
persuasive.'*  
  
It certainly is interesting information. Perpetrators with a common
characteristic of changing eye color... There seems to be something
shady going on.  
  
*'Were those past incidents also the work of demons?'*  
*'Maybe, maybe not. But it would be better to keep it in mind.'*  
*'Yes, and――'*  
  
"Hey, Chloe"  
  
My name was called, and I was surprised for a moment, cutting off my
conversation with Lucille-san and stepping out from behind Earl.  
  
"...What’s the matter, Light-kun?"  
  
As if I wasn't surprised at all, I answered calmly. Light-kun walked
over to me and matched my pace.  
  
"No, I couldn't see you. I'm glad you're following along properly."  
"I'm sorry about that. I was walking while talking to Earl."  
  
I looked at Earl as if to say 'see?', and Earl nodded, although he
didn't really understand.  
  
"…………"  
"What is it?"  
  
Light-kun was staring intently at Earl walking beside me. No, not
Earl...  
  
"That black cat looks exactly like the black cat that was with
Lucille."  
  
He was referring to Lucille-san, who was currently on Earl's shoulder.
...Oh dear. Now how should I respond?  
  
"...Yes, actually, I inherited Lucille-san's black cat as my
familiar."  
"Seriously? Wow~"  
  
I'm not lying. Because this black cat is Lucille-san's black cat, Belle.
I'm sure they would never imagine that she's actually inside, though.  
  
"What? This black cat was Grandma Lucille’s!? You should have told me
earlier!"  
  
Miranda-san, who must have overheard our conversation, came over, looked
up at the black cat on Earl's shoulder, and greeted it, "Belle, long
time no see~".  
  
"Hmm? So you met Lucille after that incident?"  
"Yes, we met by chance in town."  
"I see. We went to her house afterwards, but we were surprised to find
that it was empty. I'm glad she seems to be doing well."  
"Yes, she seems very healthy."  
  
I can feel the pressure to not say anything extra.  
  
"...Do you know where Lucille went after that?"  
"Unfortunately, I don't know that either."  
  
I dodged Kyle-san's question, thinking about how to end this topic. If I
continue, Lucille-san's true identity might be revealed. If that
happens, there’s the risk that my identity as a guardian might be
revealed as well. Given Oliver-kun's situation, it's hard to know where
information might leak from.  
  
"What are you all talking about?"  
  
Poco-chan looked at us curiously. That's right, we were escorting her
home.  
  
"Come on, everyone. Don't let your guard down. Let's pay attention to
our surroundings to protect Poco-chan."  
  
I successfully diverted the topic and drew attention away from the black
cat.  
  
"Fufu, you like this black cat, don’t you? It certainly is cute."  
"...Well, I guess so."  
  
Poco-chan didn't know anything, so she would think that. After staring
at the black cat for a while, she started walking again.  
  
*'Ugh... pretending to be a cat is tiring...'*  
  
Exhausted words dripped from Lucille-san, who had been the center of
attention. Earl was stroking Lucille-san's head, as if to comfort her.
