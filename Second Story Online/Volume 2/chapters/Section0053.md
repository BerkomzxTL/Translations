# 53・So You’re Saying I Should Level Up?

After that, I received an explanation from Lucille-san about my duties
as a guardian.  
  
I myself am completely ignorant of everything except manipulating the
terrain of the forest. It’s only been a short time since I became a
guardian, and things have been so hectic that I haven't had time to
properly check anything out.  
  
*'At the bottom of the lake lies the \[Sealed Starstone\]. It's the same
as the origin of the hero's sword, the tears shed by the star gods. That
is the core of the sealing magic circle, and its power not only seals
the great Chaos but also grants you, and me, the power to protect this
forest. And so...'*  
  
Lucille-san's explanation, to put it simply, was long winded. She has to
teach in a way that suits the people living in this world. If she said,
'Open the menu and then the guardian management screen,' it would ruin
the atmosphere. But it's a little hard to understand, so I'll learn by
listening to Lucille-san's explanation and staring at the help
section.  
  
As Lucille-san mentioned earlier, my power as a guardian comes from the
\[Sealed Starstone\].  
  
My guardian powers... well, for example, while I'm in the \[Twilight
Forest\], my stats are boosted. About +5 levels. Amazing.  
  
And if I die in the \[Twilight Forest\], the death penalty is halved. No
random drops. I can also select this log house as my resurrection point.
The power is the same as the \[Star Stele\] used for resurrection
points, which are also the tears of the same god; no, according to
Lucille-san, it has even greater power, so this much is possible. Just
as you'd expect from the \[Sealed Starstone\].  
  
However, this is all only within the \[Twilight Forest\]. Apparently,
the range of its influence only extends to within the forest. So, if I
take even one step outside the forest, the protection disappears.  
  
Then there’s the forest terrain manipulation. I can only do that about
five times a day. That's because there seems to be a limit to the power
of the \[Sealed Starstone\].  
  
*'It originally had more power, you see. But someone made a hole in the
barrier, and I used it for repairs...'*  
  
Lucille-san glanced at me. ...I’m sorry about that.  
  
"No, wait. It was definitely the person in the red hood, right?"  
*'Kakaka, so you found out.'*  
  
Lucille-san laughed with a voice that sounds like she’s having a lot of
fun. She's mean. Well, it's true that I pried open a place that was
barely sealed. But that man in the red hood was able to break such a
strong wall?  
  
*'It wasn't that much trouble to just make a hole. But it still required
considerable strength.'*  
"So he had that much power?"  
*'That's right. It's not surprising that he broke the barrier.'*  
  
Lucille-san fought him, so she probably better understands the strength
of the man in the red hood.  
  
*'That’s not relevant now though. Now then, that's about it for the
guardian's powers.'*  
"Um, I have a question."  
*'What is it?'*  
"Is that really all there is to the guardian's power? Are you saying
that I must protect this place with only this much power?"  
  
This is the sealed land that imprisons the great Chaos. Isn't the power
of the guardian who protects it a little weak? Isn't there some more
special power?  
  
*'Are you misunderstanding something?'*  
"Misunderstanding?"  
*'A guardian isn't someone special. They're just an ordinary person
entrusted with guarding the seal. I understand what you're saying. It's
unreasonable to expect you to protect this place with only this much
power. But isn't it the role of the guardian to figure out how to do it?
If you lack the power to protect, then acquiring that power is also part
of the guardian's role!'*  
  
I see. That might be true. Perhaps relying on the power of others
disqualifies one from being a guardian.  
  
...That's a valid point. It wouldn't be good for the developers to give
special powers to a single player. This is especially true in an online
game. Even looking at the guardian's current abilities, it's already
quite special compared to ordinary players.  
  
"I understand. I understand that. However... with that in mind, let me
say one thing."  
*'What is it?'*  
"No matter how strong I am... having only one guardian is a bit
worrying."  
*'I agree with that. Because that was my situation.'*  
  
Lucille-san nodded weakly. She must have remembered what happened when
she became the red beast. If there had been another guardian besides
her, they could have done something.  
  
"What about other guardians? Before that, do you know any other
guardians, Lucille-san?"  
  
It might be helpful to know, and I'm curious about other guardians.  
  
*'As far as I know, there are two. Well, anyone who wants to know about
those two can easily find out, so in that regard they're quite rare
among guardians.'*  
  
One is the Guardian of the Seal in the Holy City. The other is the
Guardian of the Seal in the Black Land. Both belong to organizations
with armies, so they're protecting the seal together with them. That's
why they can publicly reveal the seal, because they have the power to
protect it.  
  
*'The other guardians, like myself, are secretly hiding and protecting
the truth… or so it seems. I understand the Church's argument that we
should reveal the location of sealed land, but…'*  
  
If it were publicly known, it would be easier to protect. But it would
also be harder to protect at the same time. If people come and go, it
will be easier for those with malicious intent to enter.  
  
If you protect it alone, there are fewer people involved, so information
is less likely to leak out. But if information leaks out, it's difficult
to deal with. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  
  
And as for this seal I'm guarding, the information has already leaked.
The worst case scenario.  
  
"Lucille-san, you’ve protected it alone until now. But that was because
the information hadn't leaked. Now that we've been attacked and the
information is out there, it'll be difficult for me to protect this
place on my own."  
  
The man in the red hood seemed to belong to some kind of organization.
Then, next time he might come with a group. Considering this, we should
increase the number of people protecting this place. And as soon as
possible, because we don't know when. Furthermore, we should keep the
existence of the sealing magic circle a secret.  
  
We could publicly release the information and ask for cooperation, but
that would reveal our actions to the enemy. If we get attacked before we
can gather our forces, we're finished. Besides, it might attract other
malicious individuals.  
  
...Isn't this difficult? We have to fight an enemy whose arrival time is
unknown. We need forces for that. But due to circumstances, we must act
while keeping our situation secret.  
  
"Lucille-san, I think I understand your feelings now when you asked us
for help..."  
*'Kukuku. That's right, that's right.'*  
"This is no laughing matter. This is a problem that needs to be dealt
with as soon as possible!"  
*'Your attitude of trying to fulfill your duty as a guardian is good.
But don't overthink it. The more you rush, the more mistakes you'll
make, Chloe.'*  
"Why are you so calm...?"  
  
What if we're attacked tomorrow? Where's the you who was willing to risk
your life to protect this place? ...No, wait. Would Lucille-san be so
relaxed without a reason?  
  
"Are you hiding something from me, Lucille-san?"  
*'Kukuku. Now then, what secret could I be hiding?'*  
  
Ah, I can easily imagine the old woman smiling mischievously. Well, I
have no choice but to smile back at her.  
  
"Can you tell me, Lucille-san?"  
*'Hey! Stop it! Don't pull my face! This body is borrowed, you
know!?'*  
  
I went easy on her because the original black cat is pitiful. By the
way, this black cat is apparently a normal black cat now. Lucille-san
seems to have released the contract, so it's no longer a familiar
spirit. Her name is Belle, apparently.  
  
Letting go of my hand, Lucille-san began to speak as talking to
herself.  
  
*'This is my opinion. So you can ignore it. That man... the man in the
red hood won't attack immediately.'*  
"Why are you so sure?"  
*'Let me ask you something. Didn't that man say anything to you?'*  
  
She answered my question with a question. Well, I'll answer anyway. Now
then, that man in the red hood.  
  
"He seemed to like me and invited me to join him."  
*'Ah... I see. That's something he'd say.'*  
"So, what does that mean?"  
*'Then I can say with certainty that he won't attack here immediately.
Rather, he'll wait until we're fully prepared.'*  
"...Are you sure?"  
*'That's the kind of man he is. He probably thinks it's more fun to
destroy something perfect...'*  
  
I don't sense any lies in Lucille-san's words. It doesn't seem like
she's lying or joking. However, something bothers me.  
  
"What did you mean by asking me?"  
*'He’s probably aware of our situation. No, he definitely knows it. I
don't know if he knows I'm still alive, but he probably thinks that I've
entrusted the guardianship to someone. And he probably expects that
person to be you.'*  
"...If that's the case, then doesn't that mean our situation is
completely exposed?"  
*'Yes, that's why he won't attack. He's waiting for you to become
stronger.'*  
  
Even though he knows everything about our situation, he isn't going to
attack. Normally, people would crush their opponent when they are weak
because it's easier. Yes, I... no, if I think about it, I might not do
it either. It wouldn't be fun. It's more fun to fight a strong opponent
whose forces are also strong, isn't it? It's not fun to torment the
weak... what? I've figured out his psychology.  
  
"Lucille-san, you seem to know a lot about the man in the red hood."  
  
But, even if that's really the case. Doesn't Lucille-san know too much
about the enemy? We just met a short while ago, and she understands his
mindset in such a short time?  
  
*'...I have a feeling he resembles an old acquaintance.'*  
  
Somehow, I feel like I'm being told not to ask any further. Then I won't
push it. I'll find out eventually. What matters now is the man in the
red hood's movements.  
  
"...By the way, what do you think about what happened last time?"  
*'Last time, it was supposed to be reconnaissance... I think the
situation escalated because he got a little carried away.'*  
  
That's what's strange. If he's smart enough to know about us, why would
he make such a mistake as wandering around alone in the white forest?
Well, I can't talk either. I broke through the wall out of curiosity and
then got attacked by the red beast. ...What is it? Didn’t we do the same
thing? No, no, that man must have had a deep reason! I’m sure!  
  
*'It's good to think about the future. But there's something that should
take priority.'*  
"...What is it?"  
*'Chloe, you're far too weak to be a guardian. Instead of discussing
things here, you should get started on your training.'*  
  
I know that without you telling me. After all, I'm the Guardian of the
Seal, am I not? It certainly looks like I'm strong. But I'm actually a
young witch who’s only level 22. I've been worried about the level
mismatch. I'd like to be at least level 30.  
  
*'It's better to act than to ponder endlessly. As a guardian, you should
acquire powers befitting a guardian.'*  
"But..."  
*'Chloe, let things work out as they may. There are some things you
should take lightly, kukuku.'*  
  
Lucille-san, you may seem like you're thinking, but you're not really
thinking at all!  
  
For now... let's decide what to do. To prepare for the future, I need to
strengthen my defense and fighting power. And for that, leveling up is
important. I also want a regular income.  
  
\* Defense reinforcement  
\* Leveling up  
\* Regular income  
  
These three are the top priorities for the future. I'm going to be busy.
I don't know what will happen, but as Lucille-san says, it'll probably
be fine. Even if it's not fine, let's enjoy the failure. After all, this
is a game.
