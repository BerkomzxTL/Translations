# 85・Gathering Information

While flying in the air, I looked down at the town below, which was dyed
the red of Chaos.  
No, that's not all. I also saw some people fighting back. For now,
they're fewer in number than the red army, though…  
  
I arrived at the mansion. Many residents who had fled were in the large
garden. Looking around, I found a conspicuous golden group and Kyle-san
and the others nearby.  
  
Azi-chan and the others arrived after me.  
  
"Saval! I'm glad you're safe…!"  
"It's true. I'm glad you're safe."  
"You guys have no right to say that. Why did you get a 'death and
return' instead of me, the one who got caught?"  
"Eh, getting captured is way worse than dying in this game. Because your
actions are restricted—Mguh!"  
" …I won't let you say any more."  
  
Saval-kun scowled and covered Azi-chan's mouth. …This was not a
conversation that was being held in party chat. Naturally, everyone
around could hear it.  
Aside from Azi-chan, the gap between Saval-kun and Bluey-kun's role-play
and their real selves is quite large. In fact, it would feel more
natural if the roles were reversed.  
  
"The situation is serious, but let's confirm each other's information
first."  
  
Everyone gathered around. I told Kyle-san and the others about the
situation. That Poco-chan was a member of the \[Crimson Apostles of
Chaos\], and that the key was stolen.  
  
"We rescued Saval, Johnny-san, and the workers. It seems they were being
used in the Red Hood gang's scheme."  
"Scheme?"  
"This is it. They were producing the red mist."  
  
Kyle-san held a round bottle containing a red liquid. I see, this is the
source of the red mist.  
  
"The raw material for it is this junk stone. It's a type of ore that’s
rarely mined; it has no particular magical uses or gem value— a
worthless ore… I never knew it could be used for such a thing."  
  
Oliver-kun showed us the stone that became the raw material for the red
mist. …To me, it just looks like a black pebble. But it's also a type of
ore.  
  
*'The world was once consumed by Chaos. It would not be surprising if
some of the ores contained stones that had absorbed that power.'*  
  
Lucille-san, who was perched on my shoulder, said this as she was
looking at the bottle of red mist and the stone.  
  
*'Each one has a negligible amount of power, and it's nowhere near as
powerful as a Chaos Stone, a lump of pure Chaos, but if you extract and
collect it, it will have a power similar to it.'*  
  
So that's how the red mist was made.  
  
"They seemed to be doing other things too… but the red-hooded group blew
the place up. We couldn't gather enough information."  
  
I looked towards Johnny-san's house...sure enough, the building is
half-destroyed.  
  
"It's been like this since we came out. We couldn't even track them, so
we prioritized the evacuation of residents and came here."  
"I see… By the way, Oliver-kun, did you recover your ore?"  
"Ah, that elf guy over there got it back for me."  
  
Oliver-kun pointed at Saval-kun with a complicated expression. …Since
the one who stole it got it back, his feelings must be complex.  
  
"What about Klin-kun?"  
  
Saval-kun and Johnny-san were saved. But the boy we’ve been looking for
all this time is nowhere to be found.  
  
"I don't know. He wasn't in that house."  
"No way…"  
"But Johnny-san said he saw him. So it's safe to assume he was kidnapped
by those red-hooded guys."  
  
It's not a mistake again, is it…? Well, it was Poco-chan's testimony, so
it was probably a lie.  
  
"…I'm worried about Klin, but what about the red-hooded guys that
appeared in the town? If we leave them alone, the town will be
destroyed!"  
  
Light-kun said that while looking at the red town sprawling below. In
normal times, it would have been a beautiful sight, but now the red
color was spoiling the scenery, sowing Chaos and seeking destruction.  
  
"…It seems that the red-hooded people aren’t the only ones who showed
up."  
  
Looking closely, there were also people protecting the citizens from the
red-hooded group and repelling them. I could see more and more of the
people like the players who helped me earlier.  
  
"That's true. But why are so many people suddenly appearing? If they
were NPCs, it would still be understandable, but it seems like even the
number of players has increased... They weren't even here before!"  
"One of the reasons is the call to action on social media."  
  
Friday-san, with a grim expression, said that and shared a window with
me. On the screen were comments posted on social media.  
  
  
////////////////////////////////  
  
General Red Hood X @redfood_X  
*'To all members of the Crimson Apostles of Chaos. Currently, an
operation is being carried out in the Iru Mining Town. Those who want to
participate in the operation as one of the masses, please come! Let's
fill the world with destruction and Chaos!'*  
  
Monochrome @monochrome  
*'I'm at the scene now! There are a little too few players. It might be
difficult with only NPCs? Anyone who want to participate, please
come!'*  
  
MM @virtualidol_mm  
*'I'll crush you all!!!!'*  
  
MM-chan is seriously an angel! @mmfan_no20087  
*'MM-chan is too angry…'*  
  
MM-chan's Servant @mmfan_no88953  
*'But that's what makes her cute.'*  
  
General Red Hood X @redfood_X  
*'I'll answer your question. The group leading the operation and showing
their faces this time is Oz's faction.'*  
  
MELON @melon  
*'Oz's group, seriously!? Does that mean that person is also there!?
They said they would be making a move soon… It's now, huh. I'll stop
leveling up and get over there!!'*  
  
PZ @pzpzp  
*'I've been wanting to join the red-hooded group, so this is perfect.
I'll put on a hood this time. I just need to dye my hooded cloak red,
right?'*  
  
General Red Hood X @redfood_X  
*'New apostles of Chaos, welcome. Even if you're not in formal attire,
if you wear a red hood, you'll be seen as a member of the red-hooded
group, and even if you're not wearing a hood, if you wear red clothes
and we can tell if you're an enemy or ally, that's OK. If you really
want to act as a regular mob, it's better to wear formal attire and wear
a hood. But it's not that strict of an organization, so let's have fun!
Let's fill the world with destruction and Chaos!'*  
  
PZ @pzpzp  
*'Thank you, red-hooded member senpai! Let's fill the world with
destruction and Chaos!'*  
  
TAI @tai859  
*'Something serious is happening in Iru… Players on the side of justice
who can stop this commotion, come to the Iru Mining Town immediately!
Before my town turns into hell!'*  
  
////////////////////////////////  
  
"So, various people who saw this post are gathering here like this."  
  
I agree with Friday-san's words and the comments I saw. One of the
red-hooded members spread this information, calling in player members of
the same organization. And other players who saw that post are also
gathering here…  
  
I think the number of red-hooded members is too large to be only
players, so more than half of them are NPCs? The people repelling them
are surely players.  
  
"Anyway, there are people who are coming to help. Let's cooperate with
them, protect the residents, and repel the red-hooded group."  
"Yes, that would be good."  
"Hey, Friday."  
  
Just as Kyle-san spoke and Friday-san nodded, Rush-san spoke to
Friday-san. He’s clearly unhappy.  
  
"Do you really intend to get involved further? Oliver's stolen ore has
been recovered. Isn't that enough?"  
"Rush, now that we've come this far, don't you want to be involved until
the end? Besides, I think it's an interesting quest…"  
  
"Interesting? Even if we leave it alone, the NPCs won't die, and someone
will solve it. Rather, let's gather information for that dungeon I found
the other day. I don't want to be beaten to it by someone else."  
" …Rush. I believe Master would stay here and help them."  
  
When the name Master was mentioned, Rush-san faltered for a moment but
continued.  
  
"No, Friday, we're a clan specializing in dungeon clearing and raid
bosses. We're not role-players, so it's useless to get involved in this
any further. Did you forget? Our way of doing things until now. Fastest
clear updates, conquering the strongest raid bosses, winning official
tournaments… That's how we gained glory and praise, and created legends.
Even in this game, that's what we should be… Our priority shouldn't be
role-playing like third-rate actors!"  
  
Rush-san, recalling the past, appealed to Friday-san. His expression was
not acting; it was a genuinely serious expression. …This person is
seriously playing the game. In a different direction than me.  
  
"—That's Frontier's El Dorado. This isn't Frontier."  
  
Friday-san, whose demeanor had been gentle, narrowed his eyes sharply
and looked at Rush-san.  
  
"How long do you intend to cling to Frontier's El Dorado? That clan has
already disbanded and is gone. I haven't forgotten the past glory. But
that’s all in the past. What exists now is just a new clan with the same
name… a clan within the game called SSO. Then, establishing a playstyle
that matches that game and playing it is what being a gamer is all
about. If you want to play like Frontier so much, go back to Frontier.
No one will stop you."  
  
"Friday, I didn't mean to—"  
  
"Then, don't bring the common sense of the previous game here. This game
has a unique system that can’t be compared to any other. The influence
that players' actions have on the game world is strong, and the common
sense of past games doesn't apply much. …Rush, I thought you understood
deep down, but apparently, I was mistaken."  
  
Friday-san sighed wearily, but his sharp eyes returned to their former
gentleness.  
  
"…I'm sorry, I said too much. You and I both followed the Master who
declared he was retiring from Frontier and moving to SSO. I understand
that you’re not well suited to this style of game. …Therefore, you don't
need to force yourself to continue playing. Playing the game while
feeling uncomfortable is disrespectful to SSO, and to other players who
are enjoying it."  
  
…So that's the situation with Rush-san and Friday-san.  
  
Indeed, from Rush-san's attitude and personality up until now, I was
wondering why he was playing this game. Denying role-playing in a game
where role-playing is recommended would be tantamount to denying the
existence of SSO itself.  
  
"I…—!?"  
  
Rush-san opened his mouth to say something, but—a sudden roar echoed,
drowning out Rush-san's voice and the surrounding sounds.  
  
What was that!? It sounded like an explosion, like a mountain
collapsing!  
  
"Hey, look at that!"  
  
The residents around us were also making a commotion, looking in one
direction. In the town sprawling below, a large plume of smoke rose from
the lowest level. The source of the roar just now seems to be there…
Judging from the location, it's the entrance to the underground mine.  
  
"What is that…?"  
  
Dust clouds rose high into the sky, and a large shadow could be seen
from beyond. Since it's a large shadow even from this position, it must
be massive. The dust gradually cleared, and what appeared from the gap
was a monster like a kaiju. (TN: something like Godzilla)  
  
Its skin was covered in white scales harder than rock. Its needle-like
fangs were visible in its mouth, looking like it could swallow a
building whole. It had four thick legs supporting its large body, and on
its back, there were bumps like jewels reflecting the setting sun and
shining.  
  
"Guguaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"  
  
A thunderous roar shook the town. It was a terrifying roar that made me
instinctively cover my ears.  
The monster raised its legs and slowly began to move. It looks like a
living, shining white mountain.  
  
"That's… the demonic beast Willamedes!"  
  
—The demonic beast Willamedes…?
