# 83・Light and Darkness

"Chloe, watch out. As you saw just now, he can cast magic without
incantations."  
"That's right, I can cast magic without chanting. That's why you can't
win. Are you a witch who can't even fly properly in the sky?"  
"...You're talking quite a bit."  
  
Please don't say that. I appreciate you calling me a witch, though.  
  
“……That is not power that someone like you should wield, Ignis. That
power is the inscription technique devised by the first head of the
Crossring family. Have you forgotten that only the current head of the
family, the Magic Duke… your father, is permitted to wield that
power.”  
"Neither the first generation nor my father understood how to use this
power effectively...so I'm putting it into practice instead."  
  
...So, there I was, watching Lucille-san and Ignis having this
exchange... honestly, I can’t keep up with the conversation. It’s all
unfamiliar settings and plot developments. Since neither Chloe nor I
know anything about it, I can’t join their conversation.  
  
Anyway, what is a Magic Duke? Having cheat-like abilities while being of
noble birth? That setting is way too over-the-top. And a duke at that.
I'm from a viscount family. Give my character at least half that
status.  
  
Still, seeing how much Lucille-san, an NPC, is keeping up with this
conversation, maybe I'm not a player but an NPC myself? ...Yeah, that
must be it. If that's the case, I'll have to go and complain to the
management.  
  
"So? Weren't you going to stop talking? This is boring because it's all
stuff I don't know!"  
  
Saying this, I unleashed an \[Air Shock\].  
  
"...Sorry, it’s true that this story has nothing to do with you. As an
apology for boring you, I'll tell you about my power...the \[Inscription
Magic\] passed down through the Crossring family!"  
  
My \[Air Shock\] was once again blocked by the \[Barrier Magic\]
\[Defensive Barrier\]. Through Niru, I was able to see a little of
Ignis's information; I saw the \[Defensive Barrier\] buff icon for about
three seconds.  
  
"Having such an amazing technique, and yet you’re willing to reveal
it...? Are you underestimating me?"  
"Ahaha, that’s not what I meant at all. I just wanted to tell you before
that knowledgeable cat does."  
  
Certainly, Lucille-san would know about this person's abilities. She
would probably tell me if I asked...but it seems he's going to tell me
himself.  
  
"Inscription magic, as the name suggests, is magic that engraves magic
onto objects. It's a technique devised to simplify the chanting of
spells, and the head of my family invented it. Because I inherited that
technique...I don't need to chant!"  
  
Saying this, Ignis stretched out the hand not holding his staff towards
me. —On that hand were two rings. Both were gold rings with red
gemstones resembling rubies.  
  
"I thought you were wearing tacky rings, but... that's what it was!!"  
  
I tried to dodge on my broom...but four flames created by fire magic
attacked me. I quickly used the wind magic \[Wind Shield\] to avoid the
\[Fire Shot\], but \[Wind Shield\] only protects against projectile
techniques.  
  
"Ugh..."  
  
I couldn't avoid \[Flame Beat\], an attack magic that isn't a
projectile.  
  
The magic itself seems low in power, but it appears to have an effect
that lowers fire resistance and adds a \[Burn\] status ailment. A fire
resistance reduction effect and a \[Burn\] icon appeared in my status
ailment icon section.  
  
Furthermore, after a moment, he activated \[Flame Spark\] and \[Heat
Burst\]. \[Flame Spark\] is a projectile technique, so \[Wind Shield\]
blocked it.  
  
\[Heat Burst\] is, as the name suggests, the fire magic version of
\[Dark Burst\]. It's an area-of-effect skill, so \[Wind Shield\]
couldn't block it.  
  
After taking that attack, my HP bar went down by thirty percent. The
\[Burn\] status is still there, so I'm taking continuous damage, but I
managed to avoid instant death.  
  
However, this made it clear. The reason Ignis is able to use magic
without a staff. He had already equipped a medium to replace his
staff...he seems to be using magic through two rings inscribed with
inscription magic.  
  
"Chloe!"  
"Lucille-san, get back! If she gets caught up, Belle's body won't be
able to take it!"  
  
Lucille-san is currently possessing Belle's body. Belle is just a cat
right now, and although she has the power of the \[Star Stele\], I don't
want her to get too hurt.  
  
Besides, he's a higher-level opponent than us, so even with Lucille-san
here, who is still weak as a familiar, it's meaningless. No… there is
one use.  
  
*'Lucille-san, what's the fire magic he uses that takes the longest to
recast?'*  
*'It's \[Flame Spark\], twelve seconds.'*  
*'Thank you. That's all I need to know.'*  
  
After answering, Lucille-san immediately left the scene.  
  
"How long do you intend to stay on that broom?"  
  
When I looked at Ignis, a magic circle appeared at his feet. —It's the
effect that appears when casting a spell...Is he chanting a spell? He
shouldn't need to chant...  
  
Before I could think, his \[Air Shock\] came flying at me, so I used
\[Earth Shield\] to defend. ...But even while firing \[Air Shock\], the
chanting effect remained. ...Meaning, he's using the \[Double Cast\]
technique to chant another spell...  
  
It seems I wasn’t mistaken. A beam of light came piercing through the
wall. The light magic \[Raster Ray\] ...a penetrating attribute magic
that ignores shield effects. I was hit, my health further decreased, and
I entered the red zone.  
  
I quickly used a healing potion, and my health instantly recovered. At
that point, my \[Fire Resistance Down\] and \[Burn\] status ailments
also naturally recovered.  
  
"Chloe, you're not the type to run away on a broom like that. Or are you
scared?"  
"Of course not. Your magic...is weaker than magic used by a child."  
"...You're saying quite a lot."  
  
Glaring at the red-hooded man walking towards me from behind the
collapsed earth wall, I got off my broom and equipped my staff. Then I
took out \[Compacted Gouro Soil\] and \[Stone Roller Carapace Rock\]
from my item box. Using them, I created a golem.  
  
"Niru!"  
  
I gave instructions to Niru, who was flying in the air, and the golem.
To Niru, I commanded him to use \[Dark Mist\]. I gave the golem the
command \[Attack\], targeting Ignis. Meanwhile, I started chanting a
spell.  
  
"Your familiar and golem… they're no match for me!"  
  
The \[Dark Mist\] was countered by the light magic \[Flash\]. Being dark
magic, it's weak against strong light. Niru's eyes were also affected by
the Flash, and he was flying unsteadily.  
  
The golem approached Ignis and brought its fist down, but he dodged it
with a swift movement. ...That quickness seems to be the effect of
\[Wind Step\].  
  
Furthermore, Ignis seems to be moving while chanting a spell. When your
\[Magic Knowledge\] level goes up, you learn a skill called \[Movement
Casting\], so that must be it. It can’t be used at the same time as
\[Double Cast\], but as the name suggests, it allows you to chant spells
while moving.  
  
Judging by the fact that \[Rebellion\] is also at work, Ignis is at a
higher level, so it's not surprising that he knows it.  
  
Ignis stopped and chanted a second spell, bringing his staff forward. A
wall of flames appeared at the golem's feet. It's \[Flame Wall\].  
  
"Let's increase the firepower even more."  
  
Another spell was activated. This time, a tornado of wind began to
swirl. The wind magic \[Tornado\] whipped up the flames and burned the
golem. The wind and flame combined, increasing each other's power. With
that one blow, the golem was destroyed.  
  
Even though I used materials to create a high-strength golem, it was
still overwhelmed by the firepower. ...I had no idea magic could be
combined like that.  
  
This isn't the time to be impressed though. After finishing the chant, I
fired off a \[Shadow Arrow\] at Ignis. However, he used the light magic
\[Light Blade\], which canceled it out. Dark magic is inherently
weakened under the sun, so nullifying it is easy.  
  
Without paying any attention to that, I unleashed another \[Air
Shock\].  
  
"You know I can block against that kind of magic, right?"  
  
Ignis used the wind magic \[Wind Shield\], as if to taunt me. Indeed,
\[Air Shock\] is a projectile magic. It won't hit Ignis.  
  
But...this isn't an ordinary Air Shock.  
  
"Whoa...sand!?"  
  
Ignis closed his eyes in surprise. Yes, that wind contained \[Fine
Sand\].  
  
Wind Shield creates a whirlwind of wind that envelops the user. I use it
too, so I understand its properties.  
  
With that wind direction, it’ll kick up the fine sand and hit the user.
It's a defensive technique, but this time it had the opposite effect.
Thanks to that, I was able to inflict a \[Blind\] status ailment on
Ignis...but I should be careful too from now on.  
  
I took advantage of that opportunity to start chanting two spells.  
If I can just recite this...I might win.  
  
"...This is nothing!"  
  
Ignis took out something. ...Looking closely, it seems to be \[Eye
Drops\]. Ah, so he had a status ailment recovery item... His eyesight
seems to have been cured.  
  
"Thank you for surprising me. So, surprise me again. Try to withstand
this magic!"  
  
As I was chanting...that magic was activated.  
  
The reason why he hasn’t attacked continuously before must be because of
the magic's recast time (cooldown). Even if the chanting time can be
omitted, the cooldown can’t be skipped.  
  
Lucille-san just mentioned this. The spell with the longest cooldown
time among the four is \[Flame Spark\], at 12 seconds. In contrast,
\[Wind Shield\]'s cooldown time is 15 seconds, and I'm already chanting
two spells… I won't make it in time.  
  
While chanting, I received these four spells.  
  
There's nowhere to run. Even if I use \[Shadow Move\] to dodge, there
aren't any shadows nearby. I can't activate \[Exchange\] targeting
myself.  
  
Red flames engulfed my sight. However...my vision didn't turn gray.  
  
"Ah, as I thought. Your magic is...weak."  
  
The flashy effects of the four fire spells disappeared. In front of my
clear vision stood Ignis, looking surprised.  
  
"How …how are you still alive!? You took those spells head-on...and you
shouldn't have been able to use a potion yet..."  
"That's right, I didn't use a potion."  
  
Saying this, I took out some herbs from my bag and ate them. ...I wonder
if this scene looks cool. Let's eat the herbs to make it look a little
cooler. Someone, please teach me how to eat herbs in a cool way.  
  
More importantly, why am I still alive?  
  
In the midst of those flames, I ate herbs to survive. With the
\[Herbivore\] skill, I can get potion-level healing effects by simply
eating herbs.  
  
The potion's cooldown wasn't over yet, but thanks to the herbs that
served as a substitute, I was able to withstand the attack.  
  
"Don't move."  
"Tch!"  
  
Ignis tried to move, but I cast the \[Dark Bind\] I had been chanting to
restrain him. The chains of darkness bound him, so he can't hold his
staff or chant spells.  
  
"The battle isn't over yet. ...You can only chant two spells
simultaneously. Even if you have magic you can use without chanting, you
can only cast two at the same time...right?"  
  
Ignis can't use \[Quadruple Cast\]. Like me, he can only use \[Double
Cast\].  
He wasn't using some kind of quadruple casting to activate four spells
simultaneously. He's using \[Double Cast\] to cast two spells without
chanting, and he did it twice in a row.  
  
I was able to withstand that magic because I ate herbs in between those
two spells. If it had been continuous magic instead of a single type of
one-shot magic, I wouldn't have had room to heal.  
  
"Furthermore, your magic is weak. To be precise, it’s weak when you're
not chanting. When you were casting spells with an incantation and a
staff, the power was higher...the reason the power is weak is because of
the inscription magic and the rings. You were casting them
continuously...because they have low power as single casts. That's why
you're doing the four-shot combo, right?"  
  
If you can cast it without chanting, there's no need for a four-shot
combo. Fire magic is the second most powerful type of magic after dark
magic. The fact that he still needed a four-shot combo means the power
was weakened.  
  
"There seems to be a limit to magic that can be used without
chanting."  
  
I only saw \[Fire Shot\], \[Flame Beat\], \[Heat Burst\], and \[Flame
Spark\] being used without chanting. He was chanting the other spells.
It seems that not all magic can be used without incantations.  
  
Or maybe they were originally chantless. But he still couldn't use them
without equipping a staff. Inscribed magic can be activated with only
the rings...  
  
The maximum number of accessory slots is four. Since he's wearing two
rings on each hand, the four rings probably have the chantless magic
engraved on them. The magic he had been casting without a staff until
now was also probably activated by wearing rings with that magic
inscribed on them.  
  
"Trading chantless casting for power...what a clumsy technique. Let me
show you the true form of magic."  
"What can a dark magic user do under the sun? It's you who will end up
showing off poorly made magic."  
"...What are you talking about? It is because there is sunlight that
shadows—darkness—exists."  
  
It was then that a shadow slowly fell over the place where we were.  
  
"What is this... the shadow of a gondola lift!"  
  
That's right. It's the shadow of a gondola lift moving above the town.
There were no shadows in this location. But there are moving shadows
everywhere in the town.  
  
Unlike the shadows of erratically moving clouds, the gondola and its
shadow move along a set path, making it easy to calculate the location.
I was pretending to be a gust of wind, moving while flying on my broom,
to escape to where the shadow would fall.  
  
The gondola's shadow gave my dark magic some of its power back.  
  
...But it's still not enough. I want more power.  
  
Seeking even greater power, I take out cold medicine. Drinking this will
inflict the \[Cold\] status ailment, making my body heavy and slightly
lowering my stats.  
  
But at the same time, the \[Dark Compensation\] effect will be
activated. No, it was already activated.  
  
The \[Fire Resistance Down\] and \[Burn\] effects also seem to have been
targeted by the \[Dark Compensation\] effect. That makes three status
ailments. \[Dark Compensation\] increases in effect as the number of
status ailments increases. As a result, I received an enhancement effect
strong enough to cancel out the status reductions.  
  
  
I took out another \[Fine Sand\] and sprinkled it on myself, acquiring
the \[Blindness\] status effect. That makes four status effects. I can’t
see, but Niru's \[Shared Vision\] takes care of that. Niru, who had been
flashed, recovered and could show me the situation from behind.  
  
"Now, let me show you. This is the magic of a one-hit kill!"  
  
The \[Dark Bind\] that restrained my opponent was released. At the same
time, I unleashed \[Dark Burst\].  
  
"Such magic...it won't reach me!"  
  
The moment the restraint was broken, Ignis cast the \[Barrier Magic\]
\[Defensive Barrier\]... but...  
  
"Niru!"  
  
Niru, who had been waiting from behind, destroyed Ignis's \[Defensive
Barrier\] with \[Cold Gaze\] at the signal.  
\[Defensive Barrier\] is a buff effect. Niru's \[Cold Gaze\] cancels one
of the opponent's buff effects.  
  
"...Haha...I never would have guessed..."  
  
With Ignis now defenseless, my \[Dark Burst\] engulfed him.  
  
—This technique isn't a combo; it's a single, high-powered spell.
There's no room to use a healing potion.  
  
A spectacular explosion of black and purple, the colors of dark magic,
erupted around Ignis. The blast ruffled my hair.  
  
"Haah..."  
  
I drank a cold medicine to cure the effects of \[Cold\]. The \[Fire
Resistance Down\] effect also wore off. I still have \[Blindness\], but
I can secure my vision by other means for now  
  
...It seems to have worked. Once the blast settles, I should be able to
see Ignis lying on the ground—  
  
"...What is this!?"  
  
As the explosion subsided, flames surged from the center. Along with the
fiercely burning flames, the sound of birds chirping could be heard.  
  
"...It seems I underestimated you. To be pushed this far …I’m so
happy.”  
  
Ignis appeared from the heart of the flames. He smiled, seemingly
without a scratch, and a large bird was perched on his arm. The figure,
almost as if the flames themselves formed the shape of a bird, had a
somewhat sacred atmosphere.  
  
...According to the \[Summon: Familiar\] information judgment, that's a
familiar...but this is different from an ordinary monster. Because
that's definitely...  
  
"A Phoenix...?"  
"Fufu, that's right. A spirit Phoenix. My familiar."  
  
I never imagined he'd have a Phoenix as a familiar. Ignis certainly died
after receiving my magic. But he resurrected using the power of the
Phoenix.  
  
...I wish he'd stop with the illegal techniques. He did use a \[Phoenix
Feather\] to save me last time...  
  
"No, wait. A familiar is impossible. Spirit-type creatures can't be
familiars..."  
  
Didn't Lucille-san say something like that before? That because
spirit-type creatures have a higher soul rank than humans, it's
impossible... I thought you couldn't contract with spirit-type creatures
without using \[Summon: Spirit\]?  
  
"It’s true that the Phoenix's soul rank is far higher than a human's, so
it may seem impossible. But that's because you're trying to force it
into the framework of a single familiar. The limit for a human being to
have command over a familiar is three. If I say I've used all three
slots for this one...do you understand?"  
  
Indeed, the number of familiars you can contract with \[Summon:
Familiar\] is usually limited to three. If he uses all the slots for the
Phoenix...no, even then, it's still a stretch...  
  
"Even crammed into three slots, it's quite a stretch. So it's quite
unstable as a familiar."  
  
At that moment, the Phoenix shimmered and disappeared. Perhaps, like
Lucille-san, he can't properly create a vessel for it maintain its
form.  
  
"...But I still can't accept it. How could it even agree to such a
contract..."  
"Because it agreed, the Phoenix is my familiar. And, you seem
dissatisfied, but you also have an abnormal familiar. —Lucille's
master?"  
  
It's true that I also have Lucille-san, an abnormal (NPC) familiar...  
  
"Now, let's continue playing. You'll entertain me further, won't you?"  
  
Just as Ignis, resurrected by the Phoenix, turned his ring-adorned hand
towards me...  
  
"Ah, master! You were here! And you even ignored my call...!"  
  
A man with the same red hood as Ignis jumped down from the roof of the
building. He was very tall and covered in fur with a mouth like a fox,
so it must be that tall guy.  
  
"You told Poco not to play around, yet you yourself are playing?"  
"Aw, mine was a necessary pastime."  
"Then stop the other two! ...Well, I took care of it here, though…"  
  
...I thought it couldn't be, so I looked to my left. Ah, so there's a
death penalty attached.  
  
*'Chloe-san, sorry! I missed the key!'*  
*'Sorry! But it was impossible for just the two of us to deal with that
many people!'*  
  
The voices of the two came through party chat. …It seems they chased
Poco-chan, but ended up being defeated.  
  
"It seems we've gotten the key back safely."  
"It wasn't yours to begin with."  
  
I glared at Ignis, who smiled. It seems my efforts to hold him back have
been in vain.  
  
"Come on, master! Let's go back!"  
"No way— I want to play more with Chloe!"  
"We have the next operation, and if I don't bring you back, I'll be the
one scolded by him! So let's go back!"  
"Haah...Fine. ...We'll settle this another time. See you, Chloe!"  
"Ah, wait!"  
  
In the end, he got away. Today seems to be a day of people running away
from me...
