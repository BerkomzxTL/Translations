# 70・Long Time No See, Bandit-san

Instead of clouds, the shadows of gondolas gracefully glided across the
sky. Below, we found ourselves facing off in an alleyway sandwiched
between buildings on either side.  
  
"So you guys are still stealing things as usual..."  
  
Chloe doesn't have a good impression of them because she was attacked
last time. So she's looking at them with a little contempt. As for me,
I'll look at them with a smile, seeing them still as friendly and
fun-having as ever. From the bottom of my heart.  
  
"U-um, that's..."  
"So what? We're thieves. Stealing is what thieves do, isn't it?"  
"But Saval—"  
"Azi, you idiot. Shut up."  
"U-un, okay..."  
  
Sharply rebuked by Saval the elf, the cat-eared girl called Azi fell
silent. She seems somewhat dejected, with her cat ears and tail
drooping.  
  
"Now, now, Saval, calm down. Like you said earlier, we're on the run,
right? ...Though it looks like we've been caught."  
  
The boy who was earlier called Bluey, seemingly a dwarf, placated
Saval-kun and looked behind him.  
  
"You bastards... you stole my ore!"  
  
Running towards them out of breath is a man who seems to be a dwarf.
This is the one who was shouting and chasing the three earlier.  
  
"Give it back! That's a precious item I acquired!"  
"...That won't do. This ore belongs to us now, the bandit group
\[Shiokaze\]!"  
  
Azi-chan, seemingly recovered, declared proudly. The bandit group
\[Shiokaze\]... that seems to be the name of this three-person group.  
  
"Hey, Saval! That (role-play) was good, wasn't it? Right?"  
"...If you hadn't said that just now it would have been perfect."  
"Ahh...I messed up! Aw, I thought I did a good job!"  
  
Azi-chan's cat ears and tail drooped again in dejection. But I think it
was a better performance than last time.  
  
"What bandit group?! Player or NPC, I don't care! Just return my
things!"  
  
Oh, the victim seems to be a player. To be precise, a player who isn't a
role-player. He's quite angry, glaring at the three thieves.  
  
"We can't do that! We absolutely need this!"  
"...Since you refused to negotiate, we had to resort to this. I’m sorry,
but we'll be taking it."  
  
Bluey-kun seems to be holding the stolen ore. I caught a glimpse of a
slightly large ore that could easily be held in one hand.  
  
"...No matter the reason, stealing from others is unforgivable."  
  
Meanwhile, Miranda-san stepped forward, hammer in hand.  
  
"I won't let you get away with stealing from him. You'll either return
it and atone for your crime, or you'll atone for it after suffering the
consequences. The choice is yours."  
  
Her typical soft atmosphere is gone. She has a more serious expression
than usual.  
  
"...Either way, we'll have to atone for our crime."  
"Of course! What you did is unforgivable. You must pay accordingly!"  
  
By the way, players who commit crimes are wanted and chased by guards.
Depending on the severity of the crime, they’re imprisoned, rendering
their character unable to do anything until released from jail.  
  
"We were just about to go to the guards. Shall we take you with us? We
might get a bounty if you're wanted."  
  
I also took a step forward with my staff. Azi-chan shrunk back and moved
closer to Saval-kun. Am I that scary?  
  
"Will that be alright with you?"  
"Yeah, as long as I get my item back, I’m happy with anything... Thanks
for helping to catch them!"  
"You can thank me later, we haven't caught them yet, have we?"  
  
The young man on the other side, across from the thieves, nodded. The
three thieves are back-to-back, cautiously watching us as we surrounded
them.  
  
"We won't be caught easily... Bluey, use that."  
"Of course. ...We've never successfully stolen anything. That's why
we're so unwilling to give up this time... So, I’m sorry!"  
  
Bluey-kun raised his staff, and a bright light spread. The light magic
\[Flash\]...a flashbang!  
  
"Really sorry! But we won't use this maliciously, so forgive us!"  
"Azi, what are you doing? Let's run!"  
"Okay, I know!"  
  
In the blinding white light, I heard those voices. When my vision
returned, they were gone.  
  
"Damn it, the skill's cooldown was over!"  
  
Apparently, they used the flashbang before we ran into them as well.
They may have taken advantage of the opportunity to steal it.  
  
However, I feel bad about this. Or rather, it might have been
intentional. We were talking (role-playing) until the \[Flash\]'s
cooldown was over. I did the same thing to them before... but I never
expected them to do the same to me.  
  
"Niru, please search for them from above."  
  
Niru, perched on my shoulder, nodded and flew off into the sky. Through
vision sharing with Niru, I searched for them. But I can't find them.
They shouldn't have gone far... This city has a heavily uneven terrain,
with many shadows created by the staggered buildings, making it
difficult to search from the air.  
  
"...I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any clues searching from above..."  
"I see... Damn it! All that ore I worked hard to dig up..."  
  
The young man crouched down on the spot and held his head. Being a
dwarf, he looks even smaller.  
  
"Hey, why don't we go to the guards first? Reporting it there might get
them caught..."  
"Yeah... I guess I’ll do that."  
  
The young man, lifting his face, looked like he just realized
something.  
  
"I'm sorry to have dragged you into this mess... My name is Oliver. I'm
a craftsman player based in Iru... I guess that’s about it."  
  
Oliver-kun is short, typical of a dwarf, so he looked up at us while
introducing himself. It turns out he was a player after all.  
  
"I’m Miranda, a merchant in Dairode Town. Nice to meet you~!"  
"I'm Chloe, a mage apprentice. I also came from Dairode Town."  
  
After Miranda-san's introduction, I was worried about how to introduce
myself. Even though he's a regular player, I’m a role-player. Like
Miranda-san, I have to introduce myself naturally, as if I were a
resident of this world.  
  
There’s no way I could just introduce myself as the Guardian of the Seal
of the Twilight Forest, so I opted for the safe "mage apprentice." I
actually wanted to call myself a witch, but I'm not skilled enough
yet.  
  
"Ah, nice to meet you."  
  
After hearing our self-introductions, Oliver-kun smiled and shook our
outstretched hands. I don't know what he thinks of us, but he seems
friendly.
