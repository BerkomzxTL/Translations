# 90・Tears of God

"I honestly didn't think I'd see you again."  
  
I gripped my staff vigilantly, my eyes fixed on that man—Ignis—who
appeared so unexpectedly.  
  
"It seems you were in charge of breaking through Willamedes’ barrier."  
  
He seems unconcerned by my wariness. He was observing the battle
unfolding before us. From this gondola platform, we have a good view of
the players fighting Willamedes.  
  
“Yes, that’s right. I feel sorry for the demonic beast, but we can’t
allow the Star Stele to be destroyed.”  
“It’s just as you say. The Star Stele plays a vital role in maintaining
the land’s magical power. Destroying it would disrupt the land’s magic,
causing it to run rampant and potentially trigger natural disasters. Did
you do this knowing that?”  
  
…So, besides “reviving” from death, the Star Stele also benefits the
land? It had such an important role?  
  
“I knew. That’s precisely why I wanted to try and destroy the Star
Stele. …It’s a shame it seems impossible in its current state.”  
  
Ignis slumped his shoulders in disappointment. Willamedes’ shield has
been broken, allowing our attacks to connect. It hadn’t fallen yet, but
if we keep going like this, we should be able to take him down.  
  
“I figured you’d say something like that. Just like when you tried to
break the seal in that place.”  
“Fufu, that’s right. I wanted to break that seal too… Chaos would have
overflowed… I wanted to witness that power myself.”  
  
“That’s what you say. I thought it was a joke… but you actually meant
it.”  
  
A voice came from behind Ignis. A tall man wearing the same red robe as
Ignis was walking towards him.  
  
Not only did he wear the same robes, but he also wasn’t wearing a hood.
He's a half-elf, it seems, with slightly pointed ears and glasses.  
  
“Even if you could release Chaos from the seal, you would have only been
consumed by it yourself.”  
“I know that. It was just a bit of curiosity; I acted impulsively at the
time. I don't think that way now, you know? Really?"  
  
“Hmph, you’ll do it again if you get the chance.”  
  
I recognized the half-elf’s voice. It was the voice from that time… when
Willamedes appeared, he was the one addressing everyone in the town.  
  
“To all personnel, Operation A has failed. Commence Operation B. Defeat
Willamedes!”  
  
The same voice echoed. The same voice that had claimed to have released
Willamedes.  
At the same time, a group of figures in red appeared on the
battlefield.  
  
They wore the same red robes – the Crimson Apostles of Chaos.  
Following the previous command, the red-hooded group began attacking
Willamedes.  
  
“Why…? Why are you attacking Willamedes?!”  
“You guys… what are you trying to do?”  
  
My voice overlapped with Lucille-san’s.  
  
I don’t understand their goal.  
Didn't you free Willamedes to destroy the town and bring about Chaos?  
  
"By the way, who are you guys?"  
  
Then, for the first time, the half-elf man looked directly at me.  
  
He's still wearing a red robe like a cloak.  
Looking closer at his attire underneath, he has a long navy blue
garment, resembling that of a priest. It's clearly a different order
than the ones wearing red robes.  
  
“That attire… a priest from the \[Star Church\]!”  
"I never thought a cat would be the one to point that out."  
  
The man who appeared to be a priest narrowed his eyes slightly when he
saw Lucille-san, but he didn't seem to pay any particular attention to
being spoken to by a cat, or being identified as a priest.  
  
“Why is a priest of the Church involved with such a group…”  
“Of course, for the sake of the Star Gods… Is there something wrong with
that?”  
“...When did the Church fall so far?”  
“I’m not defending the Church, but I’m an outcast. However, even though
I was expelled, I still believe in the Star Gods. Therefore, I wear
these clothes as a testament to my faith.”  
  
The man lifted his red robe to show off his priestly attire. To think
that a person like this was giving orders to an organization... this
organization is really difficult to understand.  
  
“Your new plaything, Ignis?”  
“Something like that, Oswald.”  
  
Ignis replied to the man who went by Oswald. This man also doesn't seem
to be a pure believer in Chaos.  
  
“What is your goal? You sought to break the seal of Chaos, yet you don’t
worship it. You lend a hand to that demonic beast and set it free, and
now you've turned your back on it and are trying to defeat it...What
exactly do you want?"  
  
“Well, of course… it’s for our own purposes.”  
  
Ignis replied with a cheerful smile.  
  
“Since Willamedes is about to be defeated, I’ll answer! Both Oswald and
I are acting for our own personal goals. That's the only reason we wear
these red robes. If we truly worshipped Chaos, we wouldn't remove our
hoods. Faceless, without self, just a being of pure Chaos – that's the
ironclad rule of the Crimson Apostles of Chaos. Even the commanders who
need faces wear masks. Those with faces in such an organization are
simply using the organization's power – like us.”  
"...I'm surprised the people in the organization actually listen to you
even with something like that."  
  
It's strange that those members would follow orders from someone who
doesn't even believe in Chaos. The commander of this group is Oswald.
However, as you can see, Oswald is a priest of the Star Church, even
though he was exiled.  
  
I can't imagine that they would take orders from someone who is
essentially an enemy.  
  
“They believe that as embodiments of Chaos, their purpose is to bring
destruction and Chaos upon the world. Even if the leader's actions are
for personal reasons, as long as it leads to destruction and Chaos,
they’ll follow any order. Some might even believe that any act of
destruction is good enough… they’re a bunch of lunatics. But that’s
exactly why they're so useful."  
  
…I see. As the name suggests, a chaotic organization.  
  
"By the way, changing the subject... why do you think that demonic
beast, Willamedes, has such power?"  
  
Willamedes’ power…? I heard it was a Stone Roller that underwent a
mutation. Perhaps it gained its power during the mutation?  
  
…Wait. Stone Rollers manifest the stones they eat on their backs,
right?  
And those stones grant them power… wasn’t that what Lucille-san had
said?  
  
I looked at Willamedes. On its back, beautifully gleaming stones
sparkled in the light of the rising morning sun.  
  
“The source of Willamedes’ power… the stones it ate…”  
“But I’ve never heard of ore that could induce such immense growth!”  
  
"Do you still not get it? Everyone has… seen it at least once, I think,
especially when someone dies… you know?"  
  
――KWAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!  
  
At that moment, Willamedes roared again. Unlike the first roar, it was
weaker… a death cry.  
  
Willamedes’ body, along with the surrounding houses, slowly fell,
silhouetted against the rising sun.  
  
《Epic Quest: \[Defeat the Demonic Beast Willamedes\] Completed: Rating
A: Congratulations. You have earned 4 bonus skill points.》  
《Title: \[Those Who Defeated the Demonic Beast\] Acquired.》  
《Would you like to upload the video of this Epic Quest to your
history?》  
  
It seems we have truly defeated Willamedes. The notification confirmed
it.  
  
But it's not over yet.  
  
Willamedes’ fallen body was enveloped in light, and the mountain of
stones on its back began to glow. The light converged, leaving
Willamedes’ corpse and floating in the air. There were no more stones on
its back.  
  
A glowing rainbow ore was floating in the sky above the town.  
  
“Oh! It had swallowed the \[Star Tear\] after all!”  
  
—\[Star Tear\]…? Ah, I see!  
  
The tears shed by the Star Gods, the source of the heroes’ power, the
power of the Star Gods that protect this world, including the \[Star
Stele\] and the \[Sealing Starstone\]!  
  
It makes sense that it possessed such power if it consumed the power of
the Star Gods.  
  
“We will now begin the seizure of the \[Star Tear\]! All personnel,
protect the \[Star Tear\], and eliminate anyone who interferes!”  
  
Oswald barked out instructions. His voice surely reached his red-hooded
subordinates through magic (chat).  
  
“Chloe, we can’t let those people steal our \[Star Tear\]! We need to
stop them at all costs!.  
“I know, but…”  
  
Oswald opened a grimoire and began chanting a spell. …From information
provided by Lucille-san, it appears he’s casting a large-scale
teleportation spell. He intends to use that teleportation magic to move
the \[Star Tear\] somewhere else.  
  
“I won’t let you get away with this”  
  
I launched a spell, but it was blocked by a magical barrier.  
It was undoubtedly Ignis’ doing.  
  
“Ah, don’t do that!”  
  
Suddenly, Ignis looked surprised and cried out. I ignored the voice and
tried to continue chanting the spell when I felt the presence of someone
behind me.  
  
“…Eh?”  
  
I felt like my back had been slashed. My HP vanished instantly. My
vision turned gray.  
Before I became immobile, I forced my body to turn around. Behind me was
someone I recognized.  
  
“Why… Why… Tsubaki-san…”  
"This is also a matter of duty."  
  
As I fell backwards, my eyes met with Tsubaki-san's emotionless eyes. I
could also see Haku. Where did they even come from? I hadn’t noticed
them at all.  
  
“Didn’t I tell you to stop…? Don’t kill my playthings without my
permission.”  
“I am under orders from my client to protect Oswald-dono. My actions are
merely in accordance with that instruction."  
  
In my fading vision, I saw Niru disappear as the summoning state was
broken. Lucille-san must have vanished as well. Unlike when you log out,
a summoned familiar disappears without exception when you die.  
  
The possession ended, and she returned to being just Belle the black
cat, meowing at me.  
  
“Oswald, tell that girl… that your bodyguard is meddling in other
people’s business.”  
“You tell her. Anyway, you're playing around too much. Can’t you be a
little more serious?”  
"Even so, I am being serious this time…"  
  
Ignis said that, then approached me as I lay on the ground.  
  
“Sorry, I used the Phoenix’s power during our fight just now, so I can’t
heal your wounds.”  
“I don’t need your help…”  
“Ahaha, looks like I’ve made an enemy,”  
  
Even though he says that, he has a happy expression.  
Every time I give him a hateful look, he seems to be even happier… Is he
actually a masochist?  
  
"--Constructing the teleportation magic circle. Coordinate location
setting complete. …Ignis, if you're planning on playing a bit more, I'm
leaving you behind."  
"That's enough for now. I'll do it next time... Ah, wait, there was one
last thing."  
  
Just as he was about to end the conversation after hearing Oswald's
words and return, Ignis suddenly looked back at me as if he had
remembered something.  
  
“About the boy you were looking for…actually, I knew…”  
“—What?!”  
“The boy with the amulet, right? A faceless subordinate brought him,
saying he wasn't succumbing to Chaos. You know, that tall guy. Poco
probably knew too. Those two are always together. Well, I’m grateful to
him. Thanks to him, we found out the red mist is ineffective against
those with a protective amulet—it’s a defective product!”  
  
The person who testified to Klin-kun’s abduction was actually the
culprit… that shady rabbit.  
  
"Where is Klin-kun...?"  
"I wonder if he's somewhere in town right now? ...Well, if he's still
alive, that is."  
"……what do you mean"  
"Now, what do I mean?"  
  
At that moment, I received a chat message from Kyle-san.  
  
*‘Chloe, it’s an emergency! I found Klin; he’s been Chaos-ified. And
it’s not the usual weak stuff. It’s like what happened to
Lucille-san!’*  
  
“Ignis!”  
"Wow, this is the first time you've called me by my name! I'm so
happy!"  
  
I glared at him and Ignis spoke with a twisted smile.  
  
“Since I’ve been found out, I’ll admit it. Pure Chaos Stones are very
rare. I’ve been conducting research to create a substitute. I scattered
the Red Mist throughout the town for this experiment. I needed data on
the effects of Chaos-ification. But I still lacked data… so I used that
boy as a test subject. I had him drink a high concentration of the red
mist… he went berserk and went on a rampage. I couldn't control him, so
I locked him up, but when I left the mansion, I let him go. You seemed
to be looking for him, so… see? I’m kind, aren’t I?”  
  
“What’s kind about it?! You monster!”  
“Such foul language. That’s not like you. Or maybe you’re just that
angry?”  
  
Ignis seems delighted. My insults, glares, and disgust only seem to fuel
his sadism. ...I think he’ll be happy to hear what I'm about to say. But
I have no choice but to say it. Chloe would say it.  
  
“Wait… Ignis!”  
  
Turning to his back as he was about to leave, I vented my anger.  
  
“Do you think you can just forget about today…? I’ve thought it over
again. — I absolutely hate you. Someday, I will show you what’s what.
This isn’t because of some mission given to me, nor is it from a sense
of justice… it’s simply because I cannot tolerate your existence!”  
  
Even as I lay on the ground, I glared at Ignis like a cornered beast
baring its fangs.  
  
“Yeah, I’m looking forward to it!”  
  
He said that with a smile like a child eagerly awaiting a present.  
  
“Ignis, let’s go.”  
  
“Ah, sorry, I talked too much… See you later, Chloe. Let's meet
again."  
  
Oswald’s teleportation magic made Ignis and Tsubaki-san disappear  
  
…Of course, along with the \[Star Tear\] that had been in the sky above
the town.
