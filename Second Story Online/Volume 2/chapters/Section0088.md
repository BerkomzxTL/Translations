# 88・The Gathering

"Currently, there are two clans of around 20 members each in this town,
including ours. Adding the other smaller clans... the combat power of
the players we can confirm is about 100 people."  
"100 people...? Are there really that many players in this town?"  
  
In shock, I forgot my role and looked across the town. I did think there
were a lot of players, but... were there really that many?  
  
"Let me tell you, that's just the number we've been able to identify. If
you include clans that aren't cooperating, players acting individually,
curious bystanders, and the enemy side, there would be many more.
Putting it all together, I'd estimate around 500. The current situation
in this town is spreading through social media and in-game, and it'll
increase further as time passes. Even I’m surprised that so many people
have gathered, considering that it was a sudden incident with no prior
notice."  
"...No wonder it's laggy today."  
  
Actually, there's a slight slowdown in the game. With 500 people
gathered in this town, using flashy skills and magic, and even a large
boss rampaging, it's only natural that there's lag.  
  
"...Your VR equipment must be seriously outdated if this is enough to
slow down your game."  
"Rush, not everyone uses gaming-optimized equipment."  
"But even recent general-purpose models shouldn't lag at this scale,
right?"  
  
Wow~, I thought the specs of recent general-purpose models were high,
but... are they really that good?  
  
"...It's a few years old, so what?"  
"A few years old is old... you should buy a new one."  
"It was the latest model back then! And it still works!"  
"Look at how fast technology is advancing these days! A few years is
plenty old!!"  
  
Ugh... it's true that technology is advancing in the blink of an eye
year after year. VR devices used to be mainly headgear type, and AR was
mainly glasses type. Now, wristband-type devices have emerged as MR
multi-devices that combine both VR and AR. In a few years, they'll be
inferior to the current models.  
  
...Ah, wristband types are still in their early stages, and the accuracy
of sensory linkage is still low, isn't it? No, that's irrelevant right
now. Besides, in general it's not so easy to replace VR equipment.  
  
"...So, has the subjugation strategy been decided?"  
  
I cleared my throat and resumed my role-play. Friday-san briefly smiled
at me, but he quickly returned to a serious expression.  
  
"Currently, the clans that are cooperating are trying to hold Willamedes
back. Judging from its route, its target seems to be the \[Star Stele\]
in the central layer of the town."  
  
A 3D map appeared, showing the entirity of Iru from a birds-eye view.
The central layer... about two levels down from the lord's mansion, the
\[Star Stele\] is on the left side of the town from this perspective.  
  
A large purple marker representing Willamedes appeared, emerging from
the underground mine entrance. The line indicating the predicted route
cut through the town and stretched straight towards the stele.  
  
Green markers surrounding Willamedes are probably the delaying party.
Gold ones... are El Dorado's members, who are scattered throughout the
town.  
  
"This team is suppressing the red-hooded guys who are interfering. Ah,
we just received enemy position information from the observation team.
I’ll display it."  
  
New red markers appeared on the map.  
  
"...Hey wait, what's with this number of enemies...!"  
  
The red markers appearing throughout the town are far beyond
expectation. They're all over the place...  
  
"An estimated 500 people... no, enough to cover the town... with this
number, it might even be more?"  
"Isn't there way more than we have!?"  
"I guess we can consider their combat power to include NPCs... haha,
this is quite something!"  
  
Friday-san laughed, sounding more delighted than troubled. Looking at
this force, how could he be so relaxed...?  
  
"It's more like a war than a raid battle. Ah, it reminds me of that
siege battle we had back then."  
"Yes, that siege battle... the worst PVP battle ever... wait, Friday,
this isn't PVP, is it? Our specialty is PVE! PVP is outside our
expertise—"  
"Oh, please. How can you say something like that after looking at that
monster? This is a raid battle."  
"But you said there were players on the enemy side!"  
"Those are the boss's minions. Think of them as humanoid trash mobs.
Then... look, it's clearly a large-scale raid battle set in the town!"  
"...Liar!"  
  
Perhaps overwhelmed by Friday-san's momentum, with his eyes sparkling
with excitement, Rush-san stepped back a little.  
  
"Rush-san, is Friday-san always like this?"  
"Ah, yes, he is. It's been a while since he's been this excited... since
the official tournament."  
  
Where did the gentlemanly and polite Friday-san disappear to? I'm
surprised by his role-playing-level transformation.  
  
"...Ah, sorry. Now then... with this number of enemies, we'll be
overwhelmed."  
"Is there nothing we can do?"  
"Well... if we could cooperate with the unaffiliated groups moving
around the town, it might be possible... but we've never cooperated with
strays before, and if you ask whether they will obediently follow our
instructions, the answer is probably no."  
"At worst, we'll be called control freaks and be done for."  
  
Even if an unknown player suddenly appears and acts like a commander,
whether players will follow them is... questionable.  
  
"At least if we knew their movements, we could move easier. ...And we
also need to break through Willamedes' shield."  
"Shield?"  
"Ah, I forgot to mention it. Look at Willamedes. It's taking damage, but
it's putting up a barrier-like thing, right?"  
  
Willamedes was receiving skills and magic from the players in the
distance, but it was indeed covered in some kind of barrier, seemingly
making him completely immune to attacks.  
  
"We're currently investigating the Willamedes's shield armor value and
attack patterns... but judging from how it instantly repairs itself even
under such a large-scale attack, it seems that half-hearted attacks
won't do any good."  
"...It looks like we’ll have to concentrate our attacks and strike."  
  
"Yes. To do that, we’ll want to launch a simultaneous offensive... but
coordination is essential, and we simply don't have enough people to
break the shield in the first place. On top of that, we're also
struggling to suppress the red-hooded group. Most of them are NPCs, and
they're originally one organization. Because of that, their coordination
with the commander who gives orders is perfect... in our current
situation, where the command system isn't functioning, it's
difficult."  
  
Friday-san looked at us as if asking for a solution. Rush-san was also
holding his head and thinking... but it seems hopeless.  
  
...Well, is there anything I can do? If players won't follow orders,
let's try a different approach to handing out instructions... ah, I have
a good idea!  
  
"―A quest. Let's issue a quest!"  
"Quest? Players can't do that—"  
"We can. We can use a \[Request Form\]. We'll make a request (quest) for
what we want them to do... for example, say something like, suppress the
red-hooded enemies in the south of this town. We'll issue separate
requests for different locations, and by looking at the number of
accepted requests, we can get a rough idea of what other people
(players) are doing. We can also recruit members to break the shield
that way."  
"Hmm, that's not a bad idea. But..."  
  
After listening to my explanation, Friday-san spoke up with a troubled
expression,  
  
"Since it's a request, we have to set a reward. Who will pay that money?
Considering the number of players, a considerable amount will be needed.
They might do it for free... but are we willing to gamble on that?"  
"Ah... that's right, that’s definitely a problem."  
  
Who can afford to pay the reward money for 500 people? It's impossible
for a mere player. I thought it was a good idea, but...  
  
"Then, asking the lord for help is another option~"  
  
I heard a relaxed voice. Turning around, Miranda-san and Oliver-kun were
there.  
  
"I overheard the lord talking a while ago... it seems the guards are
overwhelmed with evacuation, and they're worried about how to protect
the town~"  
"I think using NPCs is also an option. If it goes well, we can cooperate
with the guards, and we can issue quests through them... that would make
things easier for us, right?"  
  
...I see. If we get the lord's help, the funding problem will be solved.
According to Oliver-kun, the lord who runs this mining town is rich, so
that shouldn't be a problem.  
  
"Using NPCs... that was a blind spot for me. Ah, but that's a unique
approach for this game."  
"The problem is that we have to negotiate with the lord. I’m acquainted
with him, so I can act as an intermediary..."  
"Right now we need all the help we can get, even NPC help. Besides, if
the other side is fighting alongside NPCs, we should too. If I have to
go and bow my head to an NPC to do so... then I will."  
  
It seems the discussion is coming to a conclusion.  
  
"Then I'll go negotiate with the lord along with Oliver. Rush, please
take my place in giving instructions at the scene."  
"Leave it to me!"  
  
Rush-san quickly took over command and began contacting the scattered
members and leaders of other clans through chat.  
  
"And, Chloe-san. Could you, along with the clan members, determine the
areas where the red-hooded enemies should be suppressed, and the number
and location of people needed to destroy the shield for the quest? We're
really short-handed..."  
"I came up with the quest idea, so I'll take responsibility."  
"Then I'll leave it to you. If you have any questions, ask Rush or the
other clan members. They've experienced these kinds of situations many
times, so they're reliable."  
  
With a gentle smile, Friday-san headed to the lord with Oliver-kun.  
  
"Chloe-chan, we'll prepare the \[Request Forms\], so come and get them
later~"  
"Okay, understood."  
  
To issue a quest, we need a \[Request Form\] first. Miranda-san said she
would prepare them, so I'll leave it to her.  
  
"By the way, Miranda-san, is Klin-kun..."  
"...Kyle-san and the others are searching for him, but they haven't
found him yet."  
"I see..."  
"Because of this situation, I think it's become even harder to find
him... it can't be helped."  
"Miranda-san..."  
  
...I don’t know. Miranda-san is a player. I understand this is
role-playing, but... this worry feels real.  
  
"...I'm still worried, but I have no choice but to do what I can.
Chloe-chan also has something to do, right? ...Klin is a strong child.
So, it will surely be okay."  
  
As if telling herself this, Miranda-san went to do what she needed to
do.  
  
...This has become a pretty serious situation. I have to make sure to do
my best to carry out what I've taken on.  
  
"...It seems the matter has been settled. Though there were some things
I didn't understand..."  
  
Lucille-san, who had been waiting with Earl and Niru within view until
now, approached me when I was alone.  
  
"I'm sorry, we were talking while incorporating the circumstances
here..."  
"Regardless, it seems a plan has been devised to defeat that thing, yes?
Then that is good."  
  
Lucille-san looked towards the town. The huge monster was still slowly
walking and destroying the streets.  
  
"That beast, too, suffered an unfortunate fate due to its power... but
as a beast that we cannot converse with, we have no choice but to defeat
it."  
  
The demonic beast Willamedes, a subspecies of the Stone Roller species.
Its power and rarity attracted the attention of the first-generation
group, and the ensuing incidents led to it being sealed underground.
Now, it's being used by the \[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\], unleashing
its rage.  
  
"...Truly, a pitiful beast being tossed around by the whims of
people."  
  
Perhaps the best course of action is to defeat it so it won't be
manipulated anymore. Though that too is a human whim, but...  
  
"But well... honestly, even I don't know if we can defeat something with
that much power..."  
"Is that so? You won't know until you try, right?"  
"...Kakaka. That's right!"  
  
I ended up having another conversation with Lucille-san, like the one we
had before coming here. I never thought I'd be fighting such a
formidable opponent.
