# 68・Shadow of Anxiety

Today, I've come to the \[Gouro Mountain Pass\] to level up. Unlike last
time, it's broad daylight. The sunlight is dazzling.  
  
"……I don't like sunlight."  
  
Since Chloe is usually a night owl, she seems to have a strong dislike
of the sun. And she can't use her specialty, dark magic. Let's adjust
her wide-brimmed pointed hat to minimize sun exposure as much as
possible.  
  
...I think I've just come up with a setting explanation for the pointed
hat. At first, I wore it because I liked it, but let's say that Chloe
wears it for this reason.  
  
Niru, perched on my shoulder, was also huddled in the hat's shadow to
avoid the light. He's also nocturnal. We both seem to have a bad
relationship with the daytime.  
  
"If you dislike the sun, should we come back at night?"  
"Absolutely not."  
  
That’s what I said to Lucille-san, who's on Earl's shoulder. I’d like to
return the favor to the ghosts from last time, but I definitely don't
want to receive that \[Mourning Curse\] again.  
  
Now, in the daytime \[Gouro Mountain Pass\], there are \[Stone
Rollers\], creatures that look like armadillos. When I came at night,
they were sleeping like rocks, but now they're active and rolling
around.  
  
"Shall we fight?"  
  
I raised my staff and began my Stone Roller hunt.  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
The Stone Rollers, which were rolling around happily just a moment ago,
were now unable to move, swallowed by the ground raised by my \[Quake\]
spell.  
  
Above the immobile Stone Rollers, a Golem dropped. Once the roar and
dust cloud settled, the Stone Rollers' HP was reduced to zero, and all
that was left was some corpses.  
  
No, I can't see their corpses. After all, the golem has turned back into
earth and there’s a pile of dirt there. It looks like a grave. If you
look around, you will see similar Stone Roller graves all over the
place.  
  
"Oh, how awful, who could have done something like this?"  
"Indeed."  
  
While having this conversation with Lucille-san, I created another
Golem. ...Clearly, I'm the culprit.  
  
...The Golem drop attack I used the other day was surprisingly
effective, so I ended up using it repeatedly. The result is this
carnage. How terrible. Passersby were quite startled. It wouldn't be
effective against the night ghosts, though, who seem immune to physical
attacks.  
  
Despite defeating quite a few, my level hasn't gone up yet. Do I need to
defeat more? I'm just accumulating loot.  
  
\[Compacted Gouro Soil\], \[Stone Roller Carapace Rock\], \[Fine
Sand\]... that kind of stuff.  
  
It seems the soil can be used to as Golem material. The carapace rock
appears to be usable for armor and other equipment. The sand can
apparently be used for blinding attacks. Fine sand seems to have a
rather low drop rate; there isn't much of it.  
  
"What is this?! Why are there so many graves?!"  
  
While I was taking a break, I heard a surprised voice. ...I’m sorry, I
was the one who made those graves. Thinking that, I turned around and
saw—  
  
"It's Miranda-san."  
"Ah, Chloe-chan~!"  
  
Seeing me, she rushed over with a relieved expression. She's wearing the
very practical and easy to move in clothing that I've seen her in
before.  
  
"What are these graves? They're so scary... could it be the work of
ghosts?"  
  
Miranda-san looked scared and hid behind me. Her hand gripping my back
was trembling slightly.  
  
"Oh, this... I'm sorry. It's my fault, don't worry about it."  
"Huh?"  
  
When I apologized, Miranda-san looked blankly at me. After I explained
the situation, she said in surprise, "Dropping Golems...that's
amazing~!"  
  
"By the way, Miranda-san, why are you here?"  
"Ah~...well...Chloe-chan, you haven't seen Klin, have you?"  
"No...you guys haven't seen him either, have you?"  
  
I asked Lucille-san and the others, but they all shook their heads.
Speaking of Klin-kun, I last saw him heading towards the mining town. If
he comes back, he'll probably go through this road or the forest.  
  
"Is something wrong with Klin-kun?"  
"Well, he was supposed to be back by today... but Klin hasn't come back
yet. Oh dear~, I wonder where he could be wandering off to."  
  
Miranda-san looked worried, with her face revealing anxiety. She seems
concerned that something might have happened to Klin-kun. Considering
Klin-kun's personality, he wouldn't wander off. That's why she started
searching for him when he didn't come back.  
  
"Sorry for keeping you here. Well then, see you later."  
"Wait. I'm also worried about Klin-kun, so let's go together?"  
  
Before I knew it, I found myself saying that naturally. I feel like I
should have gone with Klin-kun at that time in the first place. What if
I see her off and Miranda-san never comes back? I couldn't help thinking
about it.  
  
"...Really?"  
"Yes, of course. Besides, there are monsters on the road to town, and
I'd be worried about you going alone."  
  
I don't know much about what lies ahead, but it's likely to have
stronger monsters than here. Just like with Klin-kun, I'm uneasy about
letting Miranda-san go alone.  
  
"Eh, well I used to be a traveling merchant, you know~? And I've used
this road many times—"  
"You never know what's going to happen, right?"  
"That's certainly true...um, actually, I was a bit scared to go alone.
So I’m really grateful that you're coming with me~!"  
  
Miranda-san grabbed both my hands in a handshake, looking happy. She’s
that happy?  
  
"But, could I get a little money as a protection fee?"  
  
However, that doesn't mean I'll do it for free. I'd like to be properly
compensated.  
  
"...Ahaha, of course. Free isn't an option~!"  
  
There was a slight delay before she answered, but maybe that was just my
imagination.  
  
  
*'Chloe, are you really going?'*  
  
Lucille-san approached me, jumped onto my shoulder and whispered to me
via private chat.  
  
*'Is there a problem?'*  
*'…Don't forget your position as a guardian. I don't think leaving the
forest for too long is a good idea.'*  
  
I understand what Lucille-san is saying. However, Chloe would like to
help Miranda-san since she’s being paid to protect her.  
  
*'It's alright. I don't intend to abandon my duties.'*  
*'If you understand, that's good. ...As the current guardian, Chloe, all
the decisions are yours.'*  
*'Thank you, Lucille-san.'*  
*'You don't need to thank me. Besides, personally, I'm also worried
about Klin.'*  
  
It seems Lucille-san is also worried about Klin-kun. That's probably why
she gave in so easily. Or, as she said earlier, she might just speak up
but not stop me.  
  
As Lucille-san says, if anything happens, I'll use death return and come
back. ... Or rather, that's the quickest way to return.  
  
"Chloe-chan, what have you been doing with Black Cat-chan for a while
now~?"  
"Ah, um...I was just telling her we're going to the mining town."  
"Chloe-chan, you can speak cat!?"  
  
Oh no. Miranda-san is looking at me with sparkling eyes. ...I mean yes I
was talking to a cat, but...  
  
"Yes, she's my familiar. Miraculously, I can somehow talk to her."  
"Really! That's amazing!"  
  
I'm not lying. I can talk to Lucille-san.  
  
*'...By the way, Lucille-san, you were acquainted with Miranda-san,
right? I think I can tell her about you...'*  
*'Hmph...I'd rather you didn't. If my current state is revealed, your
position will inevitably be revealed as well. As long as there are
people who can notice that fact, it would be best not to give out too
much information. You never know where information might leak from.'*  
  
Lucille-san is as secretive as always. I feel a little sorry for
Miranda-san, but I'll keep Lucille-san's existence a secret for now.  
  
"Well then, let's go, Miranda-san."  
"Yes! We have to go pick up Klin quickly~!"  
  
Klin-kun, are you alright? I hope he hasn't gotten wrapped up in any
incidents...  
If something has happened, it might be interesting to solve it.
