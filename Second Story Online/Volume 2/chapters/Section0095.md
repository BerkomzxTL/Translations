# 95・Everyday Peace

"Welcome~! Chloe-chan!"  
"Chloe-san, welcome."  
  
Opening the pink door, I was greeted by Miranda-san and Klin-kun's
cheerful voices.  
  
"You two, even after what happened, you're not taking a break?"  
"We talked about it, but~ Klin insisted on working."  
"I'm fine now. It's all thanks to everyone."  
  
Klin-kun responded with a smile. Like Lucille-san said, there didn’t
seem to be any aftereffects. Since Lucille-san said it, knowing he
was truly saved makes me feel relieved.  
  
"Speaking of which, Chloe-chan. Could you tell me how many potions you
used when you reversed the Chaos affecting the guards and the people of
El Dorado?"  
"Sure… but why?"  
"Of course… I'm going to go and collect the money~! I'm going to Iru
Town again, so I'll collect the payment then~!"  
  
Miranda-san said this with a gentle smile… but right now, that smile is
both frightening and reassuring.  
  
"So, did you come to sell potions again today?"  
"Yes, that's right."  
  
I took out the potions and handed them to Miranda-san.  
  
"…Ordinary potions, huh~?"  
"Ordinary potions."  
"What about those special potions~?"  
"Now, what do you mean by that?"  
  
It's difficult to evade Miranda-san's questioning…. Well, it seems like
she gave up pretty quickly, so that's fine.  
  
*'…Still, Miranda-san is always here.'*  
*'Oh~ you noticed that? It's a trade secret, you know~'*  
  
Miranda-san is not an NPC, but a player. I've seen her quite often, no
matter what time I log in, so that's a little strange. I probably
shouldn't ask about the player's circumstances, but...  
  
*'Well, to put it simply, I run a similar general store in real life.
I'm open for business right now!'*  
*'…So, you're playing games while slacking off?'*  
*'No way! My store mostly does business through online sales. Plus, my
physical store is usually run by a support robot. So, I can play games
even while I'm working~'*  
*'That's… enviable.'*  
  
In this day and age, thanks to support robots and other machines,
people's work has become easier, and her store is a prime example of
this.  
  
*'…When I look at Klin, I'm reminded of the support robot I had at the
store back then.'*  
*'Was it an old model?'*  
*'Yeah, it was. Just like Klin, it was polite and hardworking~. Rare,
right?'*  
  
Of course, there were also perfectly normal robots among the old models.
Miranda-san's robot was probably one of those.  
  
*'That child chose the path of a machine, but that was its decision. So,
I have nothing to say… but it made me a little sad that it didn't come
back. That's why, when I found out that this game was using those old
AIs… I was happy, and I thought it might be Klin …Well, I still don't
know!'*  
  
The number of recovered AIs is far less than the number of NPCs in this
world. So, they probably copied and slightly modified some of them.
Therefore, there is a possibility that the support robot that
Miranda-san had might be Klin-kun.  
  
*'I’m really glad that he returned safely.'*  
  
At that time, I could understand the desperate look Miranda-san had when
she looked at Klin-kun. She was seeing the resemblance.  
  
*'Oh… I have to go! I got a call, so I have to go back to my real-life
store!'*  
*'Yes, I understand.'*  
  
After that, Miranda-san returned to reality… Her avatar didn't
disappear; she was just lying face down on the counter, asleep. She must
have put it in sleep mode.  
  
"Hey, did the manager fall asleep?"  
  
Klin-kun, who came out from the back room carrying boxes of restock
items, said that as soon as he saw Miranda-san.  
  
"Again, huh. I'm sorry, the manager is the type who falls asleep
suddenly even while talking to people…"  
"No, don't worry about it."  
  
... I guess it happens quite often. Maybe it was just good timing that I
didn't see it earlier.  
  
"She's quite something, isn't she?"  
  
Despite saying that, Klin-kun smiled kindly and covered Miranda-san with
a blanket.  
  
"…Hey, Klin-kun. Why do you work at Miranda-san's place?"  
"Eh? Well…"  
  
Klin-kun made a gesture as if recalling the past.  
  
"I saw the manager preparing to open the store. Somehow… I just couldn't
leave her alone. You see, the manager looks dependable, but she's the
type who falls asleep in front of people like this."  
  
Klin-kun said that with a weary sigh…  
  
"Is that really the only reason?"  
  
At that time, the recovered support robots were questioned by humans.  
  
—Are you human? Or a machine?  
  
The AIs currently used in SSO are those who answered that they were
machines, or those who didn't answer. If they had answered that they
were human—  
  
"—The manager will wake up. Let's not talk any more."  
  
Klin-kun put his index finger to his mouth and smiled pleasantly.  
  
"Ah, welcome."  
  
The entrance door opened, and a customer came in. Klin-kun spoke in a
low voice and went to attend to them.  
  
…I shouldn't have asked.  
  
The truth remains unknown… but it's fine.  
  
In this Dairode Town, there is a shopkeeper whose fluffy impression is
deceiving, and a part-time employee who supports her. Their peaceful
life has been preserved.
