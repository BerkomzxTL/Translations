# 86・Demonic Beast Willamedes

“My friends, can you hear me? I am the one in command of the \[Crimson
Apostles of Chaos\] currently in this town!”  
  
After the monster's roar subsided, a man’s voice echoed. Amplified by
magic or some other means, the voice reached every corner of the town.  
  
“Now, you can all witness it… the figure of the demonic beast,
Willamedes. That beast was imprisoned deep underground until just now.
We, deeply sympathizing with its plight, set it free. The released beast
will surely attack and destroy this town. Why would the demonic beast do
such a thing? Place your hands on your hearts and think carefully. —
Wounded by the whims of people, confined deep underground by the whims
of people. Behold the anger of a demonic beast tossed about at the mercy
of such people's selfish desires!"  
  
Willamedes roared again, seemingly in agreement with the voice. There
was definitely anger in its roar.  
  
“Ah, let me tell you one thing. You all probably think that because of
the protection of the Star Gods, you'll be fine even if you're seriously
injured. But what do you think will happen if the Star Stele were to be
destroyed? The Star Gods protection bestowed upon this land will vanish,
and even if you suffer serious injuries, those wounds will not heal. If
left unattended… you know what will happen, right?”  
  
A murmur spread through the crowd at those words.  
  
“No way… the Star Stele is alright, right!?”  
“That’s the power of the Star Gods! I-it, it can’t break that
easily…!”  
  
The players also made some noise, but the cries of dismay from the NPCs
and townsfolk was far worse.  
  
In this world, considering the setting of the \[Star Stele\], if you
suffer serious injuries, you're transferred to the base of the stone.
Your wounds heal during the transfer process, so you rarely die.  
  
Losing that protection means that even if you are seriously injured,
you'll remain in place, and if no one discovers you, you'll die. Since
an injury serious enough to activate the Stele’s power is already a step
away from death, you'll die quickly if left alone.  
  
“Willamedes will destroy the Star Stele. You should be able to imagine
what will happen then. — Well then, do your best. May the blessings of
the Star Gods be upon you!”  
  
The voice echoing through the town disappeared after those words.  
  
“…Hey, if the Star Stele is destroyed, we (the players) can’t revive,
right?”  
“That’s right.”  
  
Kyle-san agreed with Light-kun’s words. …Settings-wise, we players are
also reviving from the Star Stele. If the Stele, which is essential, is
destroyed, and you die… if no resurrection magic is cast… you might be
considered dead.  
  
“If we can't revive and die, it’s a game over? That's weird as a
game!"  
“Rush… are you still saying that? …Well, it’s alright even if you die.
Recent information says that even if you die, when you create a new
character, you can inherit the stats of your previous character.”  
  
Friday-san calmly replied. Wow… if you can inherit stats even after
death, it’s practically like you never died.  
  
“It’s not something we players need to worry about so much. …For
players, that is.”  
  
Friday-san glanced at us.  
  
Yes, that’s right. Because it doesn’t change the fact that the character
died. At least, not for role-players and NPCs.  
  
It would be different if you were to start over with a special setting
such as reincarnation, but if you don't start over with that kind of
setting, it's over the moment your character dies.  
  
“Ah, we don’t have time for this. Willamedes… this will be a raid boss
battle. To that end, we need to devise a strategy, coordinate with other
players and clans, and suppress enemy forces that will interfere—just
thinking about it, there’s so much to do! I wonder when was the last
time we've seen a raid on this scale... I'm really, really excited! So
fun!"  
  
Friday-san, who always gave off a calm vibe, was now heatedly gazing at
Willamedes destroying the town with a shine in his eyes. Friday-san… so
that’s the kind of person he is.  
  
“Well then, I'll be acting with the clan members to defeat Willamedes,
so—”  
“Hey, Friday. What should I do…”  
“Ah, Rush. You are currently no longer fit to be a member of New El
Dorado.”  
“….N-no longer fit!?”  
“Yes, therefore—I am expelling you.”  
“Wha!?”  
  
Friday-san moved his hand, called up the menu, and started operating. A
notification must have immediately reached Rush-san. Rush-san looked at
Friday-san with the expression of someone who had seen something
unbelievable.  
  
“Please have that golden armor re-dyed as well. You are no longer a
member of the El Dorado clan. …Well then.”  
“Hey, banishing someone without permission from the Master… j-just
kidding, right? Hey, wait… wait, Friday! Friday!!”  
  
Ignoring the pleas to stop, Friday-san left with his other companions.
The remaining Rush-san stood there dumbfounded.  
  
“Well… leaving him aside, what do we do?”  
  
When Light-kun said that, the remaining members began to think.  
  
“We’re suffering from death penalties, so we can’t do anything!”  
“We can’t do anything for another hour.”  
“That’s why we’re staying here quietly. See ya.”  
  
With that, Saval-kun and his friends disappeared into the crowd in the
shelter.  
  
“This town is where I have my workshop as a base, so I intend to
participate in the extermination battle. I’m a craftsman, so I’ll be
working behind the scenes, but…”  
  
Oliver-kun spoke up. It’s true that he’s an accessory craftsman. He’s
probably not good at combat.  
  
“Then, we’ll need weapon and armor repairs and sales, as well as food
and potions~. The battle has already begun, and we should build a base
immediately, but… I’m still worried about Klin…”  
  
Miranda-san has a slightly gloomy look on her face.  
  
“But, I can’t just leave this situation alone, and if the Star Stele’s
protection is lost, something might happen to Klin. I want to go look
for him, but I’ll support everyone here. So, I’d like someone to search
for Klin in my place.”  
“Then I’ll go look for him. Light, you’ll come too, right?”  
“Of course.”  
  
It seems Kyle-san and his friends will be in charge of searching for
Klin-kun.  
  
“Thank you. Then I’ll leave Klin to Kyle-san and the others~. I’ll go
look for any acquaintances among the merchants to build a base here~.
Oliver-kun, would you help me? You know more people in this town than I
do.”  
“Ah, understood.”  
  
Oliver-kun replied to Miranda-san. The two of them would remain here and
support the other players from the back.  
  
“Chloe, what will you do? You’ll come with us, right?”  
“Yes…”  
  
Now, what should I do? I came to this town to find Klin-kun. Therefore,
I should probably act with Kyle-san and the others…  
  
…I glanced sideways. At that sunken golden back.  
  
“—Still, I can’t help but worry. Really… I can’t just leave him alone
with that look on his face!”  
“M-Miranda-san?”  
  
Saying that, Miranda-san approached Rush-san, who was still hanging his
head.  
  
“Hey, can I talk to you for a moment?”  
“W-what do you want… don’t talk to me…”  
“No, answer me. Why are you playing this game?”  
  
It was, without a doubt, Miranda-san who asked Rush-san that question.
