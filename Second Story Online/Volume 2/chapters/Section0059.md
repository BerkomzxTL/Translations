# 59・Reality, Virtuality, Ideality

The sizzling sound of meat cooking filled the air. The popping of oil
and the fragrant aroma of browning meat are intoxicating.  
  
“Wow”  
  
I’m surprised by the spitting oil. This never happened in the game. It’s
been a while since I’ve cooked in real life, and these little details
can only be experienced in reality.  
  
*\*Master, that meal is detrimental to your health. I recommend this
dish instead.\**  
  
A mechanical voice spoke and brought up a window with a menu of
recommended dishes.  
  
“I know, but I still want to eat it. And you said it would be okay if it
was just one meal, right?"  
  
I dismissed the window with a wave of my hand.  
  
Certainly, the dishes you suggest are carefully calculated for nutrition
and perfectly suited to my current needs. But that’s not what I want. I
don't want to eat food made with fake ingredients.  
  
I wish you were more considerate of my feelings, but this one is
incapable of that, I suppose. Well, that was my aim, but as a result,
her predecessor ended up being a defective product.  
  
*\*Master, it’s burning\**  
“What?!”  
  
I hurriedly turned off the heat, but it's too late. When I flipped the
steak in the pan, one side was charred.  
  
Ah, the A-grade steak I worked so hard to get… Perhaps I shouldn’t have
tried to cook it myself and should have just put it in the oven and let
the machine handle it. I should've followed your advice.  
  
It cooks perfectly in the game… but I guess things don't always work out
that way in reality.  
  
“But it’s delicious.”  
  
Even though it’s burnt, the quality of the meat is good. It’s very
tasty. It has a slightly burnt flavor, so a restaurant wouldn't serve
it, though.  
  
It was worth going to the city hall to do the paperwork for this. You
can’t buy it in this area without permission; it’s such a hassle.  
  
After finishing eating, I cleaned up and took a break. It feels like it
had been a while since I had had a "real meal." Now that I've had my
fill, let's play some games again today.  
  
“…………Ah”  
  
I realized something as I went to get my VR headset. There's a partition
glass in the room, but the reflection isn't mine.  
  
“…………Hey, was permission granted for the use of the avatar settings on
the city server?"  
*\*No. Use is permitted and set only for personal servers. Avatar use on
the city server is not permitted without application approval.\**  
  
Good. So I didn't go to the government office dressed like this.  
  
Reflected in the mirror is a young girl with long black hair and green
eyes. A white dress shines brightly. It’s unmistakably Chloe, the
character I use in SSO.  
  
The only difference is that I'm wearing AR glasses. If I take them off,
Chloe disappears, and my real self is visible.  
  
It must be from the settings I left on when I visited my friend’s house
the other day. But I don't remember setting it to project onto my body…
Ah, maybe it's because I linked it to an AR terminal...  
  
I can fix the settings later. No one will see me like this.  
  
“Let me know if anything happens.”  
*\*Yes, Master. Have a pleasant time.\**  
  
I started the game and entered another world.  
  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
  
“Oh, did I wake you?”  
  
It seems to be night in this world. Apparently, Earl, noticing my
arrival, had come down the stairs. He raised his hand as if to say good
morning to me.  
  
“It’s okay if you were sleeping.”  
  
He shook his head to indicate it’s fine. He still looks a little sleepy,
though.  
  
When I summoned Niru, he yawned sleepily and appeared, then went to
Earl’s shoulder. Seeing the two of them sleepy makes me feel sleepy
too.  
  
“Lucille-san? Did you go somewhere again?”  
  
I couldn't sense Lucille-san, so I went looking for her. Belle was
sleeping in a bed upstairs, but Lucille-san isn’t with her now. It seems
Lucille-san is in an unsummoned state.  
  
I tried to summon her back using the summoning skill, just as I summoned
Niru. As I chanted the summoning skill, a magic circle appeared, and a
spirit emerged from it.  
  
*‘Hm~ It’s you.’*  
  
Lucille-san appeared, her voice also sleepy. I thought she would possess
Belle, but she remained a spirit no matter how much time passed.  
  
“Aren’t you going to possess Belle?”  
*‘I’d like to, but… she’s just a regular cat now. She can’t move without
sleep like she did when she was a familiar. She must be tired, and I
want to let her sleep.’*  
  
I see. Normally, Lucille-san possesses Belle. Possessing other animals
is an option, but it only works for a short time. She said that the
possessed subject usually chases her out.  
Belle, is originally Lucille-san’s familiar, which is probably why she
allows herself to be possessed for such a long time.  
  
*‘And being possessed all the time isn’t good either.’*  
“That’s certainly true.”  
  
I need to grow so that I can summon her properly soon.  
  
*‘Mmm… I still lack a vessel, so the summoning is unstable it seems.
Call me if something happens again.’*  
“Yes, I understand.”  
  
Then the spirit Lucille-san disappeared. It seems that in that spirit
state, she can't maintain the summoning unless she possesses
something.  
  
So, Earl, who seems to have woken up a bit, Niru sleeping on his
shoulder, and I are going…. Didn't Lucille-san just say that familiars
can move without sleep or rest? And she also said that familiars are
half-spirits... Do they not need food?  
  
“…………”  
  
I stared for a while at Niru as he was sleeping comfortably on Earl's
shoulder.  
  
Then, of course, the place I immediately went to was the field.  
  
“Whoa…”  
  
The plowed field was densely covered with herbs. A green field! Next to
it is a white field of white herbs and a red field of red grass. The
fields were colorful like that. They were beautiful in their own way.  
  
But they're all small. They're probably still growing. I'll just water
them without harvesting.  
At this rate, they'll be ready soon.  
  
What should I do in the meantime…? Just spacing out is fine, too. It
might be refreshing to do it in a place that's a little different from
reality.  
  
No, I don’t have time for that. I need to level up. As a guardian, I
need strength. Guardians need to be strong, after all. Being a strong
witch isn't bad either.  
  
And there’s Lucille-san’s situation. It’ll be inconvenient if I don't
create a stable vessel for her soon.  
  
The quickest way to level up is to defeat monsters. So, I’ll go fight to
level up.
