# 91・In Search of a Happy Ending

I returned by death and headed to the place where Kyle-san said Klin-kun
was, near the \[Star Stele\].  
  
“From what that guy said, it seems he was given a potion made from the
same ingredients as the red mist, right?”  
“Yes, that’s what I heard.”  
  
I put the re-summoned Lucille-san on my shoulder, and we flew through
the air, guided by Niru.  
  
“That’s… Klin-kun?”  
  
When we arrived, Kyle-san and others were gathered, as well as other
people who appeared to be players.  
In the center, a boy was rampaging. His body was half-eaten away by a
crimson beast, and his red eyes were very familiar.  
  
“Klin!”  
  
Miranda-san and Earl burst through the crowd. They must have received
the same message as me and had just arrived. They were shocked by
Klin-kun’s changed appearance.  
  
Klin-kun was swinging a huge beast-like arm at Kyle-san. Kyle-san was
currently holding him off, so there was no danger of him attacking
others… but this couldn’t last forever.  
  
“You’re finally here! Use that potion!”  
  
Light-kun told me that, and Miranda-san, Earl and I all took out potions
and threw them at Klin-kun. The three potions hit him, and a recovery
effect appeared… but.  
  
“Gaaah… GAAAHHHHH!!!”  
“Hey, why? Why isn’t it purifying him?!”  
  
Light-kun’s panicked voice echoed. …Klin-kun hadn’t changed at all.
Light-kun couldn’t confirm the purification.  
  
“Gwa… GAAAAHHHH!!!”  
"This is bad...!"  
  
By throwing the potions, Klin-kun changed his target to us. …He’s fast.
His speed reminds me of Lucille-san when she turned into a red beast.  
  
I deployed an \[Earth Shield\] just in time, but it was immediately
shattered by the beast’s arm. Even though I have a death penalty now and
my magic power is weakened… its destructive power was inhuman.  
  
“What, another red beast?”  
  
Klin-kun’s attack aimed at us was blocked by a sword. …It was Rush-san
who showed up.  
  
“Heal that pretty boy with the shield. I’ll hold this guy off, so use
your restraint skills to stop his movement!”  
“Okay!”  
  
Rush-san gave out instructions to his clan members. Kyle-san was healed,
and Klin-kun was afflicted with \[Paralysis\] by a thunder magic
\[Spark\], which doesn't inflict damage, and he stopped moving.  
  
I was honestly surprised by their skill. Are you the same leader of the
clan that I blew away last time?  
  
“His movements are completely stopped. That’s all we can do. Saving him
is your job (role-players), right?”  
“Rush-san… why?”  
“ …I just came to repay my debt to that woman.”  
  
Rush-san said, looking at Miranda-san. Indeed, it was Miranda-san who
helped him get back on his feet, allowing him to work with his clan
members.  
  
“Thank you for your cooperation. …Now then, they stopped him, but…”  
“Unlike with the red mist, Klin-kun was forced to drink the ingredients.
So, something as simple as holy water alone won’t be enough to exorcise
it.”  
  
Kyle-san and I looked at Klin-kun, whose body was immobile due to
paralysis. In that state, it's impossible to bring him back to normal
with just holy water. That means…  
  
“That just means we need the hero’s power, but—”  
"Hey, that guy called Light over there is the hero, right? I saw it on a
video!”  
  
At that moment, some of the onlookers started to shout.  
  
“You’re the hero, so do something!”  
“Show us that special power of the chosen one!”  
“Save that kid quickly!”  
  
The voices around us grew louder.  
Certainly, Light-kun was chosen as the hero. But…  
  
“…I don’t have it. I don’t have the Hero’s Star Sword. That’s why I…
can’t use the hero’s power…”  
  
Having had the greatsword Rex stolen by Tsubaki-san, Light-kun can no
longer use the hero’s power. Without that sword, Light-kun is no
different from a normal player.  
  
“What the hell, you can’t use it?!”  
“What a hero, you got a rare skill and this is what you do at a crucial
moment?!”  
“Stolen? You’re trash. If I had that right, this wouldn’t have
happened.”  
“If you had the sword, you could have saved that kid… It’s your fault if
he dies.”  
  
The unreasonable expectations and disappointment of those around him
were mercilessly poured onto Light-kun.  
  
“Shut up! I… I would have… if only I had the Star Sword…!”  
  
Unable to retort to the cruel words, Light-kun hung his head, clutching
the sword that wasn't the Star Sword in his hand in frustration.  
  
…I never thought it would turn out like this. Being chosen as a hero
isn't all good; it's quite tough. It’s true that he doesn’t have his
sword right now, but even if he did have it, he would probably still be
criticized.  
  
The role of a precious hero is one that very few people can achieve.
Those who are able to take on that special role attract people, are
envied and hated. The reactions of those around us seemed to reveal a
part of the dissatisfaction with this clear disparity.  
  
“Shut up you outsiders! You’re just spectators!”  
  
It was Rush-san who sharply silenced the noisy crowd. The voices of the
onlookers quieted down, but it didn't solve the problem.  
  
“Chloe-chan… is there really, really no way to save Klin…?”  
“Miranda-san…”  
  
Miranda-san, clutching her skirt tightly with both hands, stared at
Klin-kun, who was crying out in pain in the center.  
  
…I thought it was role-playing.  
  
But, there, instead of acting (role-play), I felt genuine emotion—a
strong desire to save Klin-kun.  
  
“Hey, you’re a role-player, so can’t you do something?!”  
“You say that easily… if there was anything then I would have done it
already."  
  
Just because we’re role-players doesn’t make us special. We’re the same
as other players.  
  
*‘…Lucille-san, is there anything we can do?’*  
*‘Honestly, if only we had the sword. …Since it’s not a pure Chaos
Stone, there shouldn’t be a long-term impact. We could capture him and
recover Light-kun’s sword, or contact the Star Church, but…’*  
*‘That’s an option too… but I want to solve this immediately. …I don’t
want to see Klin-kun or Miranda-san suffering like this.’*  
  
Klin-kun and Miranda-san are special to Chloe. The two from the general
store, who had taken care of her since she couldn't even speak properly
in Dairode Town. She couldn't ignore the fact that these two she cared
for were suffering.  
  
And—  
  
*‘—Because games are supposed to be fun, right?’*  
  
There were tears in Miranda-san’s eyes. …Couldn't save Klin-kun? No one
wants that ending. Not Miranda-san, not Chloe, and not me.  
  
*‘There's plenty of lake water. Can we do something with quantity?’*  
*‘No. It's true that it’s just the power of Chaos, not a pure Chaos
Stone, but… that alone won't restore him. It would be different if the
hero’s power was added, but for this guy to wield the hero’s power… no
wait.’*  
  
The black cat seemed to be lost in thought for a moment, then slowly
raised its drooping tail.  
  
*‘The lake water contains the power of the Star Stone… The hero’s power
is that of someone who can freely manipulate the power of the stars… The
reason why the greatsword Rex, imbued with the Tears of God (Star
Tears), can be wielded is because of that… It’s a powerful force, so it
chooses its user, but if it's the slight power of the stars within the
water, a hero might be able to handle it… then, by gathering the power
sleeping in the water and shaping it into an easily usable form… but if
that happens…’*  
*‘Lucille-san, you’ve thought of something?’*  
  
Lucille-san was muttering to herself. But you could tell by looking into
her eyes. She’s found a way to help.  
  
*‘…It’s possible, but I honestly don’t recommend it.’*  
*‘Why?’*  
*‘This option will reveal that you are the Guardian. Even if you aren't,
you’ll be suspected, no doubt. Can you do that in front of this
crowd?’*  
  
Looking around, the number of spectators had increased considerably.
It's right after we defeated Willamedes, so it's understandable that
players are gathering.  
  
If it was revealed that I was the Guardian… that information would
spread instantly. There would be no way to hide it. Still…  
  
*‘The answer is already decided. —Of course I’ll do it! Even if it
reveals I'm the Guardian. …Besides, Ignis already knows, doesn't he?
What's the point of hiding it now?’*  
*‘—I thought you’d say that. You’re right. Then, I’ll also make up my
mind —I’ll show myself.’*  
  
She had already predicted my answer, but still listened as …more of a
confirmation.  
  
*‘Chloe, you have the grimoire for summoning Magic Familiars I gave you,
right? Get it out.’*  
  
Without quite understanding, I took out the grimoire that I had
carefully stored in my item box. This was the grimoire I got
Lucille-san's paw print signature on.  
  
*‘…Open it… I think it’s on the last page… Yes, there it is!’*  
*‘What is this?’*  
  
As I flipped through the book, I found a piece of paper tucked inside.  
  
*‘It’s a high-level scroll I made, a familiar summoning magic.’*  
  
\[Scrolls\] are disposable magic items that can only be used once. They
allow the use of a single magic sealed within, without needing to learn
the skill or consume MP. However, they are incredibly expensive. They
are not something that can be used lightly.  
  
*‘Honestly, I made it as an experiment, and I forgot about its existence
since it didn’t have any use… but if you use this scroll, you can handle
magic that is more advanced than the summoning magic you currently
possess. Using that —summon me.’*  
*‘Lucille-san… you mean?’*  
*Yes, summoning me this way, I should be able to be summoned in human
form. Then… I can come up with a way to solve this situation.’*  
*‘Really!?’*  
  
Being able to summon Lucille-san in human form… That shows just how
powerful the magic contained within this scroll must be.  
  
“Miranda-san, I think we can do something!”  
“ …Chloe-chan?”  
  
Smiling at Miranda-san, who had tears in her eyes, I started preparing
as Lucille-san had instructed.  
I released Niru and Lucille-san’s summons. …Since I needed to re-summon
them using the high-level scroll, she said that if I left them as they
were, it would interfere with my summoning magic.  
  
“Light-kun, look up. We need your strength.”  
“ …But I don’t…”  
“You need a sword, right? If there’s something to take its place, there
shouldn’t be a problem.”  
“ …Huh?”  
  
I took out a large quantity of lake water from the box. Thirty buckets
full of water lined up.  
Then I held out the scroll that Lucille-san made in my hand.  
  
“Alright, it’s your turn. Lucille-san!”  
  
When I used the scroll, the paper floated in the air on its own. As the
paper burned, a magic circle appeared. The magic circle in the air moved
downward, and light emerged from it. That light took on a human form.  
  
“Kakaka. Magician Lucille-san, responding to your summons! It’s been a
while, everyone!”  
  
When the light subsided, an old magician with her white hair tied up
stood there with a gentle smile.  
  
“L-Lucille-san!?”  
“Oi, why is Lucille here!?”  
“Grandma Lucille!?”  
  
Surprised voices rose from Kyle-san and the others. It's only natural to
be surprised when someone who had never shown their face appears
suddenly in this way.  
  
“Hey, isn’t that Lucille? The one from that cleaning quest.”  
“Yeah, she was in that video too… why is she here?”  
“That was a familiar summoning spell, right? Does that mean she’s her
familiar!?”  
  
Then the reactions from the surrounding people increased. Lucille-san
was an NPC who gave quests in Dairode. So there were players who had
taken her quests.  
  
Also, the video… the incident where she became a red beast became an
epic quest, and it is included in the official history. Some players
must have seen it. Some people also knew that Light-kun was the hero
because of that.  
  
“Sorry, but I don’t have time to explain. …Chloe! This is a scroll
summon, not a regular summon. To maintain my form, I’ll be using your
magic power. Be very careful about maintaining your magic!”  
“I understand!”  
  
My MP is already decreasing. It hurts that my maximum MP is reduced due
to the death penalty. I have to be careful not to run out. If it does
runs out, Lucille-san’s summoned state will be canceled.  
  
“Let’s begin.”  
  
Lucille-san pulled out something from nowhere... as if by magic. It was
a magnifying glass pendant with a decorative cover shaped like a book
and stars.  
  
“—Chief Librarian Vivilia of the Library of the Stars. I would like to
borrow these three books: \[Grimoire of the Spirit Jack Frost\],
\[Blacksmith Vulcan’s Records\], and \[Legend of the Star Hero,
Rex\].”  
  
*‘Special membership card authenticated. Following the Chief Librarian’s
authority, the lending of \[Grimoire of the Spirit Jack Frost\],
\[Blacksmith Vulcan’s Records\], and \[Legend of the Star Hero, Rex\] is
authorized.’*  
  
Responding to Lucille-san, a childlike voice was heard, and three books
appeared in the air with a flash of light.  
  
*‘Lucille-sama, thank you for your patronage after such a long time.
When the loan period ends, please return the books, including any
overdue ones… We would appreciate it.’*  
"...Ah, maybe someday."  
  
Lucille-san muttered something to the stranger. …The Star Library, huh.
I believe it was the name of an organization in the magic city Unirei
that manages dangerous grimoires from all over the world.  
  
“Now then, books, chant. Play the knowledge inscribed within—《Concert
de Livre》”  
  
Lucille-san chanted those words. At the same time, the three books
opened while floating in the air.  
  
“Spirit Jack Frost. A spirit who controls snow and ice. This grimoire
contains such magic techniques.”  
  
The lake water floated in the air. It gradually froze.  
  
“Blacksmith Vulcan. The name of the blacksmith who made the weapons of
the five heroes who once saved the world. This record contains the
methods he used.”  
  
The ice gradually changed shape. The shape was like a sword.  
  
“The Hero Rex. Everyone knows him, also called the Star Hero, a star
bearer. Light-kun was chosen by the sword once used by the hero. In that
case, we must adjust it accordingly. This book contains the legends
about Rex.”  
  
Looking closely, the sword being created looked like the \[Greatsword
Rex\].  
  
“Amazing… I didn’t know Lucille-san could use this kind of magic.”  
“This is a magic I developed that makes maximum use of knowledge
recorded in grimoires and books. If it’s written in a book, I can
reproduce and borrow its power.”  
“ …That ‘humble magician’ thing was a lie.”  
“No, I am a humble magician. …Compared to other magicians, that is. More
importantly, are you alright with your magic power?”  
  
Hearing that, I realized that I didn’t have time to be impressed by the
sight in front of me. Lucille-san’s magic use was increasing my MP
consumption. I was about to run out, so I used a magic potion.  
  
But…  
  
“Not enough…”  
  
Even so, the recovery rate isn’t enough. My magic is rapidly
depleting.  
  
“…It's taking longer than I thought to make this. Can you hold out a
little longer?”  
  
I can’t dismiss Lucille-san’s summon. If I do, there’d be no more
chances. I don’t have a second scroll.  
  
Somehow, by eating magic herbs and blue roses together, I managed to
achieve a recovery comparable to a magic potion…but it still wasn’t
enough. The magic potion’s cooldown isn’t over yet.  
  
“Earl, a magic potion!”  
  
When I said that to Earl, who was nearby, he nodded and used a potion
for me. A blue effect representing magic recovery enveloped me. My magic
recovered, but…  
  
“Still…not enough! It’s decreasing rapidly!”  
  
The rate of depletion was too fast for the potion’s recovery to keep up.
At this rate—  
  
“Chloe-chan, use my potion too!”  
“Use my potion as well!”  
“Mine too!”  
  
Miranda-san, Kyle-san, and Light-kun each used their potions. The
recovery effects from the three overlapped.  
  
“—Then use mine too!”  
“I have one too!”  
“I don’t know what's going on, but use this!”  
“I’ll cast a spell to increase your natural magic recovery!”  
“You’ll need a maximum value increase as well.”  
  
Starting with Rush-san, not only the clan members but also the onlookers
helped me, providing potions and buffs. Thanks to them, I no longer
needed to worry about my magic.  
  
“Okay…it’s done!”  
  
After a while, it was complete. An ice greatsword made in the likeness
of the greatsword Rex. Its blade, reflecting the morning sun, is like a
light dispelling the darkness.  
  
“Light-kun, I leave the rest to you.”  
“ …Ah, thank you, Grandma Lucille!”  
“Don’t you dare fail. I can’t make a second one.”  
  
The moment Light-kun received the ice greatsword floating in the air,
Lucille-san disappeared. She vanished due to running out of magical
power.  
  
“I’ll put an end to your suffering immediately…!”  
  
Light-kun, sword drawn, glared at Klin-kun, whose movements were
sluggish due to the \[Paralysis\] status ailment. Then he rushed forward
and struck Klin-kun.  
  
“Ugh… gahhhh!!”  
  
The instant the ice greatsword struck, it shattered, and the red area
covering the wound, as if being purified, rose up as smoke and
disappeared. Gradually regaining his human form, Klin-kun returned to
his original self.  
  
“Klin!!”  
  
Miranda-san ran towards Klin-kun, who had collapsed on the ground. We
followed her to make sure he was okay.  
  
“……Man…ager?”  
“Klin—ugh… thank goodness!! ”  
“Whoa, Manager, don’t hug me! What’s going on here anyway!?”  
  
From the looks of it, Klin-kun seems to be alright. Seeing that,
everyone breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
“That’s great!”  
“A happy ending is always the best!”  
  
I heard the same voices of joy from the people around me. There were
people who were happy with me, so it's not like all the people watching
were bad. Some even threw potions at me.  
  
“Thank you. This is all thanks to everyone!”  
  
Miranda-san thanked everyone present, including us.  
  
For a while, I wondered what would happen, but I’m glad we managed to
save Klin-kun.  
We were able to do it thanks to everyone’s help. Thinking this, I
watched over the crowd that was starting to disperse.
