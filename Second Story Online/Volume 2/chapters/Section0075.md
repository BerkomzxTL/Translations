# 75・You’re Under Arrest

After our break, we resumed our search for Lily-chan in the town. The
team was the same as before: me, Niru, Kyle-san, Light-kun, Miranda-san,
and Poco-chan.  
  
Poco-chan volunteered to help find Lily-chan this time. She probably
feels anxious and doesn’t want to go home until Lily-chan is caught.
It’s reassuring to have her. Since she lives in this town, she knows it
well.  
  
I had Niru search from the air, but the terraced houses are hindering
the search. The gondola lifts crossing the sky via cables and the tiered
buildings make for a beautiful landscape, though.  
  
Incidentally, I'm becoming somewhat familiar with this town. This is
probably thanks to the effect of my \[Local Knowledge\] skill. When I
open my map, information about the areas I’ve frequently walked is
shown. I’m happy that it also shows detailed changes in the town across
different times of day.  
  
…Though, so far, I’ve only walked through this town during the day. It
seems the night passed during our break, and it's daytime again, just
like when I first arrived. Niru also seems to have a hard time flying
during the day, so he came back. Ah, I miss the night.  
  
“Oh, right. Miranda-san, I have a favor to ask of you. And Earl too.”  
“For me?”  
  
I spoke to Miranda-san and Earl, who were walking beside me, and they
looked at me curiously. I gave them each a potion – different potions.  
  
“……This potion is different from Earl’s. I would've preferred the other
one~”  
“As expected of Miranda-san. You’re very perceptive……”  
  
A merchant's eyes can't be fooled. She probably judged it using an
appraisal skill.  
  
“Anyway, if you see anyone with red eyes, throw this at them.”  
“Okay~”  
  
Miranda-san and Earl nodded in agreement.  
  
“Still can’t find her…”  
  
Light-kun said, looking around. We have no idea about where to find
her.  
  
The only clue is that she's attacking people while searching for
someone. But since we don't know who that someone is, it's difficult to
find her unless Lily-chan takes action and causes a commotion.  
  
“I’ve already checked this area. Let's go to that district over
there.”  
“Yes.”  
  
I nodded at Poco-chan’s suggestion. The map still has many blank spaces,
but the information for this area where we’ve searched for Lily-chan is
quite full.  
  
That means we've searched this area thoroughly. Of course, this includes
information from Niru’s aerial search. I wish I could fly, too, but it
takes a lot of magical power and I can only fly for a short time of
about five minutes.  
  
“……—!? Wait, I hear a scream!!”  
  
Poco-chan’s urgent voice made everyone react. It seems our target has
taken action.  
  
“Where did it come from?!”  
“This way! I’ll guide you!”  
  
With Poco-chan leading the way, Kyle-san and Light-kun followed
cautiously. Miranda-san and I followed behind them.  
  
  
  
“Get out of the way! Get out of the way! GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! Don’t
interfere with Lily!!”  
  
As we approached the scene, we heard a loud shout. I recognized the
voice.  
  
“Wait! Don’t run away again!! Leave your soul behind!!!”  
  
Along with that voice, something flew from around the corner of the
alley. Upon closer inspection, it was a person who crashed into the wall
of a house, groaning as they fell.  
  
“Found her!”  
“…Tch, it’s you guys again.”  
  
Rounding the corner, we found Lily-chan, the demon. …Behind her, in the
depths of the dark alley, a red mist was rising, and within the mist
there was the shadow of someone disappearing.  
  
Judging by the earlier scream, it seems her target has already left.  
  
In the alley, besides Lily-chan, there were several people. Some were
lying down, while others were standing unsteadily. All of them had red
eyes.  
  
From the dissipating red mist, another person emerged and attacked
Lily-chan.  
  
“Ah, this is annoying! I don't need weak souls like yours!”  
“Stop it!”  
  
Kyle-san quickly stepped in to stop Lily-chan from attacking the
red-eyed person. The clash of scythes and shields echoed around us.  
  
"Isn't it your fault that they did this?"  
“Onii-san, is your eyesight bad? Lily hates those guys who did this to
them even more!”  
“….It doesn’t seem like it’s for the sake of others, but it seems that’s
the case.”  
  
The two glared at each other with their scythe and shield still locked.
Still, we learned one thing: Lily-chan, the demon, doesn’t seem to be
the one who gave the residents red eyes. It was probably the figure we
saw disappearing into the mist earlier.  
  
“Sorry, but I can’t play with you guys yet. Bye~”  
  
Lily-chan pushed back against his shield and tried to take flight, but
dark chains appeared and bound her wings.  
  
“What the—?!”  
“There’s no way I’m letting you escape twice so easily.”  
  
I said that after having activated \[Dark Bind\] with my staff. This
time, I wouldn’t let her escape. So, while Kyle-san and the others were
talking, I chanted the spell.  
  
“Now, quickly capture her. The power of darkness is weak during the day,
so it won’t last long.”  
“Right!”  
“What are you doing—?!”  
  
Kyle-san put away his weapon and, having somehow produced a rope out of
nowhere, began to tie her up. There's no need to worry about her
escaping.  
  
“Now, the others.”  
  
I looked at the people who were also bound by \[Dark Bind\] along with
Lily-chan. They were within range, so they were also affected.  
  
“Leave it to me!”  
  
Along with that voice, potions were thrown at the bound people. It was,
of course, Miranda-san and Earl.  
  
“Gwaaaahhhhh!!!”  
  
One of them, the person hit by Earl's potion, cried out in pain. A red
effect dissipated from their body as if something was being exorcised.
After a while, their eyes changed from red to their original brown
color, and they fainted.  
  
On the other hand, there was no change in the person hit by
Miranda-san's potion. Their eyes remained red.  
  
“……Ah, as I thought.”  
  
I applied the potion to those who still had red eyes. They cried out
similarly, but then had peaceful expressions as if something had been
removed, and fell asleep.  
  
“Chloe, what was that…?”  
“…The Chaos that possessed them has been expelled. What did you do?”  
  
Kyle-san and Light-kun were both surprised. Light-kun even knows that…
As expected of someone holding such an important position as a hero.  
  
“…These are potions with holy water in them. The ones I had Miranda-san
and Earl throw were also the same. Well, Earl’s had holy water, but
Miranda-san’s was a regular potion… I had them throw it just to be
sure.”  
  
…They actually contained water from the lake in the Twilight Forest.
Telling the truth would be complicated, so I said it was holy water,
which has the same effect.  
  
“I see, because it was holy water, its power purged the traces of
Chaos.”  
“Since it was Chaos that could be purged with holy water, I think it
wasn't as strong as before…”  
“…The cause must be the red mist from earlier.”  
  
Kyle-san looked convinced. The red mist that had been blocking the
street a while ago had dispersed without a trace. We didn’t know why
people were being corrupted by Chaos and getting red eyes, but the mist
seems to be the cause.  
  
“Using holy water in potions… that’s quite extravagant~”  
“I just made it as a test run.”  
“Hmm, a trial, huh~. It seems like a lot, though, and I think I bought
something just like this before…”  
  
…Miranda-san’s gaze is piercing. I may have made a mistake. Holy water
is supposed to be expensive. It’s strange for me, who isn’t affiliated
with the church, to use so much of it in potions. Miranda-san, being a
merchant, must have noticed… She’s really perceptive.  
  
“Anyway, we need to hear from this girl.”  
  
There, bound and unable to move, was Lily-chan, her face contorted in
displeasure.
