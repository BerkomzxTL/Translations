# 51・Are You Interested in SSO?

/////////////////////////  
  
\[Let's Talk About History! \#130\]  
  
――This is a fragment of a story.  
――A part of the lives of the people who live in this world.  
――This is the history of this world.  
  
Excerpt from the SSO official website, History section.  
  
This is a place to talk about the history found on the SSO official
website.

Is it true that the Demon King and Hero have been spotted?  
  
503://Anonymous User 2  
\>502 It's briefly shown in the video from \#101. It seems they happened
to be there.  
  
504://Anonymous User 2  
Hearing "hero," I came here, but it's Ace, huh? I wanted a female
hero...  
  
506://Anonymous User 2  
Speaking of heroes, I found a new hero. They were in \#105.  
  
507://Anonymous User 2  
\>497 MM-chan seems to be in \#70. There's no video, so it's
unconfirmed.  
  
510://Anonymous User 2  
If it's MM-chan, she was also in \#101. Only briefly shown there
though.  
  
512://Anonymous User 2  
Were there any other stories besides \#21 and \#90 about that country
during its founding? I'm curious about what happened.  
  
516://Anonymous User 2  
MM! My Angel! Love!  
  
520://Anonymous User 2  
I watched \#105. Not only a hero, but even the Red Hood gang appeared!  
  
523://Anonymous User 2  
\>512 If you want to see the country's situation, it's better to check
the King's streaming site.  
  
527://Anonymous User 2  
\>507 That's definitely MM-chan. I confirmed it in her past livestream
videos.  
  
532://Anonymous User 2  
The knight and ninja who appeared in \#105 seem to have high PS (Player
Skill). They're the kind of people I want in my clan.  
  
535://Anonymous User 2  
The magician's technique in \#105 was crazy! Those flashy guys were also
miserable.  
  
536://Anonymous User 2  
It looks like a "Dark Compensation" combo. Speaking of famous combos
using this, there's the one in \#68.  
  
  
/////////////////////////////////////////////  
  
  
It seems that the combo using the skill \[Dark Compensation\] is quite
famous. Even here, the videos we appeared in were being talked about.
More people will probably come to the forest...  
  
"Are you playing games again? I think it was called SSO, wasn't it?"  
  
I was looking at the screen of my terminal when the woman in front of me
spoke. Through the holographic screen, she was peering at me from across
the table. The old book I had been reading earlier, which is rare these
days, was placed on the table.  
  
"Yes, I am. But the game is currently under maintenance, so I can't log
in until it's finished."  
  
Glitches and bugs hinder comfortable gameplay, so maintenance to fix
them is unavoidable.  
  
"Maintenance is important. Even when I was still a machine, I once
suffered a power failure due to a malfunction in my management function
and collapsed on the roadside. It was quite a predicament. However, at
that time, my husband helped me…"  
  
And then, needless to say, she started bragging about her husband after
that. Well, I’ve met her husband before, and he was a very nice person…
I'm sad that I won't be able to see him anymore.  
  
"Ah, yes. This book was very interesting."  
  
  
After her boasting was over, she pointed to the book in her hand. As
always, she reads quickly.  
  
"The story in this book seems to have a to-be-continued ending. The next
volume is…"  
"I thought you'd say that, so I've already mailed you volume two."  
"Really? Thank you very much."  
  
She smiled with a very natural smile. Nowadays, there aren't many people
who would be happy to read such an old book. In this day and age, when
it comes to books, it's all about ebooks.  
  
As I was talking to her, my terminal beeped. It seems the maintenance
has been extended. Oh… It looks like I won't be able to log in today
either. That's a shame.  
  
"Is that game fun? I just searched for reviews, and it seems to have
average ratings…"  
  
She seemed interested and looked at the screen of my terminal. Indeed,
the game's reputation is average. Or rather, another VRMMO that came out
a few years ago is incredibly popular, so even if it were a hit, it's
overshadowed.  
  
"But it's a popular game among a certain group."  
"Role-players… is it?"  
  
She nodded, apparently having already searched and found the answer. The
game introduction site I saw the other day introduced it as the number
one game for role-players. But since it's filled with role-players, it
seems to be a difficult game for the average player to pick up. It seems
like the barrier to entry is high even if you want to role-play. It may
be that it's not that popular with the general public because of that
environment.  
  
However, the fact that it hasn't shown any signs of service termination
yet might be because it's a game by the major company NR. It's one of
the world-famous companies whose name even people who don't play games
have heard of. So, somehow, SSO still has players.  
  
"…Role-players are players who act out their characters… Perhaps
influenced by NR, a company that originally sold board games, the
majority of users in that company are such players. …Due to this
influence, it's likely that there are many role-players among the users
of games such as the EO series, A2, and SSO. ――I found several articles
with similar content. I see, I've learned a bit about what kind of game
SSO is."  
  
It seems she's finished searching. She's looking at me with her lens
eye… That's a bad habit of hers. It's true that in today's world, you
can get information regardless of national borders if you search.
However, it's not good to decide things based solely on information from
the world. After all, only by trying something directly yourself can you
truly get your own answer. Even more so if you have the opportunity to
learn.  
  
"Should I play SSO…?"  
"Yes, you should. Now that you know so much, you must be a little
interested. I won't allow you to not play it just because it has average
ratings."  
  
Ultimately, how you rate something depends on the individual. A game
that someone else says is boring can be a fun game for you. It's a
reference, but it won't become your own answer.  
  
"Can I even play? It's a game for people, so I…"  
"What are you saying now? Aren't you human?"  
  
Maybe she’s forgotten that she's been recognized as a human. Although
limited, she has better memory than me, better than the average person.
Besides…  
  
"You can meet your former companions."  
  
Recently, an official announcement finally came. Regarding the AI
implemented in the game's NPCs. As rumored, it was the AI used in those
outdated humanoid support robots.  
  
Currently, all of those outdated robots have been collected by Noah
Industries, the developer, and can no longer be seen, but it seems
they've repurposed that AI for SSO. Well, since Noah was involved in the
development of SSO, it's not an impossible story. By the way, Noah also
sells VR equipment. The device I'm using is also made by Noah.  
  
The delay in the announcement was… Well, there were various
circumstances. That AI was quite controversial.  
  
"You're right. …I'll think about it."  
  
It's settled then. It seems that the number of applicants for next
month's recruitment quota is larger than before. So I advised her to
apply for one of those slots.  
  
Incidentally, the official announcement stated that they will gradually
be able to accept new players anytime after that. The time for lifting
the player limit is apparently significantly later than other games.  
  
I also recently learned that most online games don't restrict the number
of players from the very beginning of service. It's plausible if it's
after the servers crashed due to too many players, but this game has had
restrictions from the start.  
  
The official statement says that they had to restrict the number of
players to operate the game properly, and they implemented a
lottery-based player limit. However, they haven't revealed what problems
led to that decision.  
  
  
Well, the problem is obvious. Players were saying that it was mainly the
settings of the characters that each player controlls. You know, their
origins, their backgrounds, etc.  
  
For example… Well, let's take heroes as an example. The probability of
being selected is unknown, but currently, three or four heroes have been
confirmed. If there were more players than now, the number of selected
heroes would likely double. If that happens, the world will be
overflowing with dozens of heroes.  
  
This could be solved by the operators restricting the probability, but
there are other problems. The backgrounds of characters other than
heroes. They too would be limited in number. It seems difficult to
increase them without causing issues.  
  
Chloe, for example, is from a noble family. I don't know how many noble
family lineages the developers have set up, but it seems unlikely that
everyone who wants to be a noble can become one.  
  
...It seems that a young lady ran away from home, squandering away a
valuable noble slot. It can't be helped. She lost out to the name value
of a noble. But she didn't lose to being a hero. Right? So it's fine,
right?  
  
…Let's get back to the point. In short, the limit on the population with
proper backgrounds in the world of SSO limited the number of players.
While it wasn't determined who would be who, the number was fixed to a
certain extent.  
  
If they accepted an unlimited number of people, the world of SSO might
have collapsed.  
  
Ah, surprisingly, this world is not free. Real-world constraints are
evident. The gods (developers) of this world don't seem capable enough
to increase the population indiscriminately and manage it.  
  
"By the way, is your current avatar also a character from SSO?"  
"Yes, her name is Chloe."  
  
Saying so, I stood up from my chair to make my whole body visible to
her. Usually, Chloe wears a pointed hat and clothes close to gothic
lolita style, but now she's wearing a simple white dress. I don't
usually use the avatar function, so I don't have clothing data and I’m
using the default outfit.  
  
I extracted the character data and tried using it outside of the game.
Incidentally, if you use this function, you can use that character's
appearance in other games as well. If they support it, of course. It's a
paid service, by the way.  
  
"She's quite cute."  
  
That's right. That's right. But she's cutest in her witch attire. I
originally wanted to come in the same outfit as in the game, but the
outfit data costs extra, so I gave up this time.  
  
"Ah, it's already this late."  
  
When I noticed, the setting sun was shining through the window. Houses
with whitewashed walls, black roofs, and chimneys were bathed in a pale
orange. A sturdy cleaning robot passed through the cobblestone street
that still keeps its traditional appearance  
  
"Then, I'll come again."  
"Yes, I’ll see you later."  
  
As I waved goodbye, I cut the communication by operating the menu, and
the room, dyed in the sunset, disappeared from my view. Then, after a
few seconds of complete darkness, a familiar white room appeared in my
vision. The blinding morning sun was shining brightly through the
window. I could see the familiar scenery through the headgear-type
device that I also use to play SSO.  
  
Now, I can talk to my best friend across the world anytime.
Technological advancements are truly amazing.  
  
Well, not everything is good. …but I guess I'm just an old-fashioned
person who thinks that way.
