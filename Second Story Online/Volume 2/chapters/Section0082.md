# 82・One Who Is Both Living and Dead

A wide street sandwiched between buildings. Seeing us fly over,
passersby were watching from a distance, wondering what's happening.
Above, the gondola lift, visible from anywhere in this town, was moving
slowly.  
  
In the center of the street, I glared at Ignis. As always, his
appearance, coupled with his almost childlike smile, is annoying. That
relaxed attitude of his is infuriating to Chloe.  
  
“Why has it possessed a cat, even though it’s a familiar... it is
because it cannot properly materialize as a familiar. Considering that,
your familiar possesses considerable power, so much so that you can’t
properly summon it. Furthermore, you remained unaffected by the Chaos in
the red mist earlier. Without an amulet, and not a hero… considering
that the cat is Lucille-san’s familiar, there’s only one answer. —The
familiar possessing the cat is Lucille, and you’ve taken over as the
Guardian of the Seal. Am I wrong?”  
  
All of this is probably just his speculation. But I can’t deny it.  
  
“…I wish you were a little more stupid.”  
  
…It seems Lucille-san has no intention of hiding anymore. There’s no
point in denying it after being seen through so thoroughly.  
  
“Well, Lucille. Long time no see.”  
“Ah, it really has been. How many years? I never imagined I’d meet you
like this.”  
  
Apparently, Lucille-san has met Ignis before.  
  
“…Huh? When did we meet? I don’t remember.”  
  
Ignis, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to remember. …His expression is
more confused than surprised.  
  
“You were so young. It’s no wonder you don’t remember.”  
“Ah, that’s right. …I had heard of you, but I never thought we’d
actually meet.”  
  
Ignis said this in a somewhat relieved tone. …The words that followed
seemed carefully chosen. I wonder…although their conversation seems to
be connecting, somehow it feels like it isn’t.  
  
“I never thought that Duke Irvine would tell you about me. …I suppose
so. Ignis Eldred Crossring, son of the ducal family that rules the magic
city of Unirei.”  
“…That’s quite a nostalgic name. Since my father disowned me, no one has
called me that. …By the way.”  
  
For a moment, Ignis seemed to be reminiscing about the past, but when he
looked at Lucille-san again, his eyes were harsh.  
  
“Why is Lucille alive? You were cursed by the power of Chaos and should
have died.”  
  
Just as Lucille-san took a step back, a blade of wind flew towards where
she was. This is the \[Wind Cutter\] magic I often use. Since the
original magic doesn't require chanting, I don't know if he didn't use
that same power this time.  
  
"I thought you were supposed to be dead... so you're lingering in this
world as a familiar...? I never imagined that you, a high-ranking
magician, would fall to the status of a familiar. And to a mere,
still-inexperienced apprentice, at that! Even though I did intend to pay
my respects to you... to have fallen this far... you're hardly worthy of
being called a magician!"  
  
It's true that humans rarely become familiars through contract. Monsters
and animals are the usual subjects. Entering into such a contract could
be said to mean that they have fallen to the same status as them.  
  
Furthermore, Lucille-san is a higher-ranking magician than I am. A
high-ranking mage not only reduced to being a familiar, but an
apprentice’s familiar. There’s no dignity left.  
  
“Certainly, everyone has a desire to live. But isn’t twisting the
natural order to do so wrong?”  
"...You practically took my life, and yet you say that."  
“That’s right, I practically killed you. No, I should have killed you.
…I should have destroyed you, yet your soul remains in this world.
…Chloe, it’s you who’s keeping her soul here, isn’t it?”  
  
The smile disappeared from Ignis’s face. His eyes were now like the
sharp tips of swords as he looked at me.  
  
“What should be offered to the dead are flowers, not salvation. You
shouldn’t have saved her. Lucille doesn’t deserve it.”  
“…Lucille-san isn’t dead yet.”  
“No, Lucille is as good as dead. If the familiar contract is broken,
Lucille-san will die. That fate is already decided. Otherwise,
Lucille-san wouldn't have contracted with you. To continue living, she
had no choice but to become a familiar. …Familiars are a soul contract.
By contracting with your soul, Lucille-san's body and soul were merely
separated… all you’ve done is postpone her death.”  
  
The subject who becomes a familiar loses their physical body. The
contractor creates a new body for them to use. Lucille-san’s body was
already cursed by the Chaos.  
  
Now, as a familiar, she’s separated from her body, but if the contract
is broken, her soul will return to her body. What will happen then is
obvious.  
  
“Lucille wasn’t saved. ...You're carrying around something neither dead
nor alive, a being between life and death."  
“…So what? What’s so wrong with that?”  
  
“Everything's wrong with it! Because there’s a glorious life, there’s
the despair called death… It is because of death that we can destroy the
fleeting hopes of those who struggle desperately to live. …That’s why I
can’t forgive the existence of something that doesn’t die. If I accept
it, the value of destroying things will diminish.”  
  
It seems he’s saying that he finds joy in watching things break down.
Perhaps it's the same enjoyment as mercilessly destroying a sandcastle
painstakingly built by someone else on the beach.  
  
If it were a sandcastle that wouldn't break… well, it wouldn't make
sense, would it? It's supposed to be a fragile sandcastle, yet it won't
break at all.  
  
…Perhaps that was a bad analogy. With Ignis’s childishness, he seems
like a bully who appeared in a sandbox.  
  
But, I understand a little. Lucille-san was supposed to die, but she’s
being kept alive in a distorted way. Is this really the right thing to
do?  
  
“…The resurrected beastkin child and Lucille’s death are different. The
cat girl still had a chance. Even if the resurrection failed, if she was
seriously injured, the Star Stele would call her back. …But Lucille is
different, isn't she? Being abandoned by the Star Stele means there's no
hope of salvation. She was doomed to death; even resurrection magic or
the power of the star gods couldn’t save her… and you averted that
fate.”  
  
Inhabitants of this world are safe thanks to the power of the Star
Stele, even if they're seriously injured. However, this excludes fatal
wounds that even the Star Stele cannot heal, or situations where their
connection with the Stele is severed by some means.  
  
Lucille-san’s body was already corrupted by Chaos. Even if the Chaos is
purged, irreparable damage remains. No matter what treatment… her body
was beyond repair. Lucille-san's heart has long since stopped.  
  
—But, still.  
  
“…Lucille-san is still here. The fact that she’s here means she isn't
fated to die yet.”  
“Then tell me, do you know how to save Lucille?”  
“I don’t know. But I’ll find a way someday.”  
“What if you don’t find a way?”  
“Even if I don’t… as long as I’m alive and contracted with Lucille-san,
she won’t die.”  
  
Ignis shook his head in exasperation at my answer.  
  
“…Ah, that’s right. She certainly won’t die. Lucille will live by using
your life. Like a parasite. …Lucille, why did you contract with Chloe?
Did you want to live that badly?”  
“…I didn’t intend to—”  
“What’s the difference? Ah, perhaps it was because you're that kind of
person. Taking advantage of a young girl's compassion to cling to life…
truly a rotten woman, amazing!”  
  
Lucille-san fell silent at Ignis’s words. …As Ignis says, her life was
extended thanks to my life due to our contract. To call her a parasite
though…  
  
"You've been saying whatever you want for a while now. But your words
are wrong.”  
“I only stated the facts.”  
“Well, there may be some truth in what you say. But Lucille-san isn’t
using me. It’s the other way around. I’m using her.”  
  
Lucille-san, who had been avoiding my gaze, looked at me. Looking into
her blue cat eyes, as if talking to her true self, I continued.  
  
“Who initiated the contract? Not Lucille-san, but me. I thought it would
be a shame to lose you, a magician with vast knowledge, and I wanted you
as my teacher… so I offered you a contract, even though you were dying.
You had already prepared yourself for death, and I stopped you from
giving up on life, so Lucille-san doesn't need to bear the
responsibility or receive these undeserved words.”  
“Chloe…”  
“Well, that being said, I wish you'd act a little more like a
teacher.”  
“…You always say too much.”  
“Oh, my apologies.”  
  
I laughed jokingly, and the black cat's tail and ears, which had been
drooping, perked back up. This is how Lucille-san should be.  
  
“Now, do you understand how wrong you were?”  
“Ah, yes. I understand the circumstances of your contract. But no matter
the reason, I still can't forgive Lucille's existence. She’s essentially
dead.”  
  
It seems Ignis’s opinion hasn’t changed. Well, it was obvious that it
wouldn’t matter what I said to him.  
  
“Let’s end this conversation.”  
  
Ignis said this with a childish smile.
