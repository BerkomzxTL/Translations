# 74・Taking Breaks Is Also Important

After that, the guards arrived immediately. We went back to the guard
post to explain what happened at the scene.  
  
After being questioned by the guards, we gathered at a table in a corner
of the entrance. With me was Niru, Earl, and Lucille-san the black cat.
Also, Kyle-san, Light-kun, and Miranda-san. Poco-chan is here too. She
came back with us because it wasn't safe to go home.  
  
"Now... at the moment, the most suspicious person is that demon, Lily,
wasn't it? It's clear she's involved in this series of assault cases."  
"Involved? She's the culprit!"  
  
Poco-chan immediately reacted to Kyle-san's words. As a victim, she
believes Lily-chan is the culprit.  
  
"Well, we'll find out once we catch her. Let's go find her instead of
just sitting around. There's also the matter of Klin, who was taken."  
"Yeah... I'm worried about Klin."  
  
Light-kun looked ready to leave his seat. Next to him, Miranda-san's
expression was worried after hearing Klin-kun's name.  
  
"But... that demon said she didn't know Klin..."  
"She's lying. Klin-kun was kidnapped by her... Don't be fooled!"  
  
Poco-chan argued with Miranda-san, who was sitting opposite to her.
Poco-chan claimed that she had seen Klin-kun being kidnapped.  
  
"Klin-kun's case is concerning... but there's also the matter of the red
eyes. I don't know how they're connected to Lily-chan... but leaving
this alone would be dangerous. After all, Chaos is involved."  
  
We asked the victims, but they don't remember anything. Their eye color
has returned to how they were, and they're now perfectly fine.  
  
"It must be that demon's fault. She must have done something to them!"  
  
Did Lily-chan really do something to them? It feels unsettling...  
  
"For now, let's follow Light's suggestion and find Lily again and get
her to talk. It's sure to be a clue to solving this case."  
  
Several assault cases haved occurred in the city. The perpetrators all
have red eyes and an aura of Chaos.  
  
And then, the one who either attacked them, or made it happen... the
demon, Lily-chan, is said to have sparked the incidents and kidnapped
Klin-kun.  
  
...There are just too many mysteries to consider. Lily-chan probably
holds the key to unraveling them.  
  
"Then, let's go find her—"  
"No, why don't we take a rest for now? Chloe-chan and I have been on the
move since we arrived in town."  
  
It was none other than Miranda-san who interrupted Light-kun and made
that suggestion.  
  
"Yes... I was just about to suggest taking a break too."  
  
It's been quite a while since I started traveling with Miranda-san. I
also wanted a break somewhere.  
  
"But..."  
"I understand you're feeling anxious, but taking a break is important
too."  
"That's right. I want to catch her soon, but we need to be in top
condition."  
"Okay..."  
  
Persuaded by Kyle-san and Poco-chan, Light-kun reluctantly agreed.  
  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
  
I came back after my break. I seemed to be the first one back, as no one
else was at the guard post's entrance. Or rather, only Earl and
Lucille-san were there, to be precise.  
  
*'Chloe, can I talk to you for a moment?'*  
*'What is it?'*  
  
Lucille-san approached me as soon as she saw me. Even though private
chats—or magical communication as it's called in this world—are
possible, it's impossible to hide the movement of one's mouth. Since
it's not easy to talk openly, I don't have many opportunities to talk
with Lucille-san.  
  
*'…What do you think of this case, Chloe?'*  
*'Well… Lily-chan the demon is currently the most suspicious, but I
don't think she's the root cause of everything.'*  
  
She seemed to be searching for someone. I don't know who it is… but I'm
curious.  
  
A lie she told to escape...? No, would there be any point in Lily-chan
lying in that situation?  
  
If what Lily-chan said was true, it contradicts Poco-chan's testimony…  
  
It contradicts Poco-chan's testimony that she kidnapped Klin-kun. She
was either lying or mistaken… Poco-chan said her memory was vague
because she hit her head during the attack…  
  
Wait a minute. Isn't Poco-chan also a victim of an assault?  
  
She said she was attacked by Lily-chan. So, was she Lily-chan's
target?  
  
No, when they met, Lily-chan didn't react to Poco-chan… It might be
understandable if it was someone from the area, but there’s no way
anyone could be mistaken for her, a beastkin with distinctive features.
Does that mean that's not the case?  
  
But then, why was Poco-chan attacked by Lily-chan? The possibility of
Lily-chan mistaking her is, as I said earlier, unlikely. So, was
Poco-chan just caught up in it?  
  
Lily-chan herself doesn't seem to be obsessed with Poco-chan. It seems
like the reverse might be true.  
  
*'…This case is difficult.'*  
*'Yes, it is. It would have been nice if it were easy...'*  
  
We only came to look for Klin-kun, but why'd it have to get so
complicated? Well, as a player, it's more interesting than solving a
simple case, so I'm not bored.  
  
*'…By the way, what do you think about those with red eyes?'*  
  
Lucille-san asked, her fur slightly bristling. She must have remembered
her experience of being turned into a red beast before. And the people
with red eyes this time may be victims of Lily-chan, just like
Poco-chan.  
  
*'…Light-kun said there was the presence of Chaos. Then, I think they
were affected by Chaos. However, unlike your case, they remained human
in appearance, and their eyes returned to normal when they woke up.
Considering this, I think the influence of Chaos was extremely weak.'*  
  
In Lucille-san's case, she was transformed into a red beast, losing her
human form. While the loss of reason is the same, the influence is lower
than in Lucille-san's case.  
  
*'Their eyes returned to normal when they woke up… That is what bothers
me. The power of Chaos is incredibly strong. If it's a fragment of Chaos
sealed within a Chaos Stone, even one the size of a grain of sand can
easily drive a person mad. It's strange that they returned to normal
without the power of a hero.'*  
  
Indeed, the power of Light-kun was essential when saving Lucille-san.
But this time, Light-kun didn’t have the hero's sword, so he couldn’t
use that power.  
  
Yet, even despite the missing hero’s power, the people with red eyes
returned to normal after waking up.  
  
No, one person was different. The person I tried to help with a
potion…  
  
Come to think of it, why was he suffering then? The others attacked, but
he didn't attack and even recovered before them…  
  
Was it the potion?  
  
No, I'm sure Kyle-san gave potions to others as well…  
  
*'In any case, Chaos is involved. Therefore...'*  
*'It's possible that the people in red hoods are behind it.'*  
  
…So far, we haven't seen them. But if the red-eyed incident is their
doing…  
  
Maybe they were the ones who got in Lily-chan’s way.  
  
There are still many things we don’t know, like Klin-kun's disappearance
and Lily-chan's motives. We don't have the clues yet to figure it out.  
  
When everyone else returns, we'll need to go find more clues.
