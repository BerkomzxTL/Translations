# 80・The Mask Removed

*‘That’s why we're chasing Poco-chan. We’ll leave the other situation to
Kyle-san and the others.’*  
*‘Understood. Contact me if anything comes up!’*  
  
I let Kyle-san know that the key had been stolen. From here on, we would
be taking separate actions. Kyle-san and his group were heading towards
the mansion, while we were pursuing Poco-chan, who had stolen the key.  
  
Leading the chase were Azi-chan and Niru. Following them were Bluey-kun,
myself, Earl, and Lucille-san.  
  
"I'm sorry, Bluey-kun. Despite my suspicions, the key was stolen...and
about Saval-kun too..."  
"Don't worry about it. Besides, you don't need to worry about our Saval.
He was abducted, but we know he’s safe."  
  
Running next to me is the dwarf named Bluey-kun, who's shorter than me.
He didn't look dissatisfied at all and just gave me a carefree smile.  
  
Then a party invite popped up from Bluey-kun. I accepted it, and looking
at the party members, I saw—  
  
*‘Saval-kun...?’*  
*‘Whoa...I didn't expect the Black Witch to join…’*  
  
A lively voice came back; surprisingly energetic for someone who had
been kidnapped. Normally it would be strange to be able to communicate
with someone who's been abducted, but...well, it's a game, so it's best
not to think too deeply about it.  
  
*‘Ah, no, nothing. Forget what I just said!’*  
  
Saval-kun hastily reverted to his usual in-game tone. He probably
usually uses party chat with just the three of them, so he wasn't
role-playing.  
  
*‘Let's keep this off the record since we're in party chat. I'll do the
same.’*  
*‘Wait...Chloe-san, you're a player!?’*  
*‘I...I kinda thought so...but you really are a player...?’*  
  
I can hear Azi-chan's surprise, and Saval-kun, though the way he speaks
is different, it's definitely Saval-kun. Their voices were audible in my
ears.  
  
*‘Hahaha, this is a surprise! I didn't know you were a player
either!’*  
*‘I...I'm more surprised by you…’*  
*‘Huh? What's so surprising about me?’*  
  
That voice...it's Bluey-kun, right? I involuntarily glanced beside me.  
  
The way he speaks is vastly different from his role-playing earlier. The
gap is incredible.  
…Of the three, he might be the best at role-playing.  
  
*‘So, Saval-kun is alright, then?’*  
*‘Don't worry about me. I just escaped my bonds and I'm about to get out
of the room. And help will be coming, right?’*  
*‘Right, you seem alright.’*  
  
His calm voice eased my worries.  
If that's the case, it seems like it's okay to leave them alone.  
  
*‘The enemy is so stupid. They kidnapped Saval even though he didn't
have the key. It's a good thing I kept the key after all.’*  
*‘Well, that's true in hindsight...last time Azi, you dropped the
requested item in the river, so I couldn't trust you…’*  
*‘That was because pursuers were coming! I dropped it because I was in a
hurry, and anyone would have dropped it if they were in my
situation!’*  
*‘Alright, alright, let's stop arguing. We have a guest today, you
know?’*  
  
Azi-chan and Saval-kun's voices echoed in the party chat. Bluey-kun
gently stopped them...It seems that the relationship between the three
of them doesn't change whether they're role-playing or not.  
  
*‘Oh, right. Sorry, sorry.’*  
*‘I'm sorry...Ah, Kyle-san sent a party invite, so I'll move over there.
Chloe-san, please take care of Azi and Bluey.’*  
*‘Yes, I'll rely on you as well.’*  
  
Saval-kun left the party. Kyle-san sent him a party invite. It would
definitely be easier for them to coordinate if they formed a party
separately.  
  
*‘...Azi-chan, can you steer Poco-chan to the left at the next
corner?’*  
  
Now, let's coordinate our efforts.  
  
Observing Poco-chan's escape from Niru's sight and Azi-chan's movements,
I compared it to the map of the town. Since I’m now in a party with
Azi-chan, it’s easy to see where they're running. Incidentally, judging
from the marker that was visible until a moment ago, Saval-kun is indeed
at Johnny-san's mansion.  
  
*‘Uh, I'll try my best...but it's a crossroad, so it might be
difficult…’*  
*‘Please block the path ahead. My familiar Niru will block the right
side.’*  
*‘Understood!’*  
  
After a while, they reached that point. Azi-chan sprinted further to
stand in front of Poco-chan's path. Niru blocked the path on the
right.  
Since we're chasing Poco-chan from the road she just came from, there's
only one way she can go.  
  
*‘Okay, lead her to turn right at the next corner. It's a fork in the
road, so even Azi-chan alone should be able to do it.’*  
*‘Got it!’*  
  
That’s how we guided Poco-chan's path. This town, with its varying
altitudes and complex layout, has many blind spots, and—  
  
"A dead end!?"  
  
Her surprised voice came from a distance. Yes, I had led her to a dead
end. Currently, my map information of this town is almost complete. This
is also thanks to Niru's aerial reconnaissance. This must have also
triggered the \[Local Knowledge\] effect. A detailed map has been
created, and I can see on the map which path leads to a dead end.  
  
"Well, there's nowhere to escape, Poco-chan?"  
  
Instead of a rat in a bag, she’s become a rabbit in a bag. We—Azi-chan,
myself, and Bluey-kun—surrounded her.  
  
"It's not like that...I had no choice!"  
"...Is that true? Then let's talk for a bit."  
  
Her words are suspicious. Or maybe I'm just hearing what I want to
hear.  
  
"Your behavior is hard to understand. When we caught Lily earlier, you
heard the scream first...but why didn't you hear anything when we first
encountered Lily...?"  
*‘I was wondering the same thing…’*  
  
Lucille-san was the first to react to the shouts when we first ran into
Lily. Why didn't Poco-chan, a rabbit beastkin who should have better
hearing, hear it...? Yet, during the second encounter, she was the first
to hear the scream...  
  
"Depending on the direction of the sound and the echo, it might not be
audible...Why are you jumping to conclusions?"  
"Even if the sound wasn't audible...when you rushed to the scene, why
did you take the longer route?"  
  
I noticed when I looked at the detailed map. The route Poco-chan took
when she guided us to capture Lily-chan was a long detour. There's a
shorter route.  
  
"That's because...there were echoes...and I’m not familiar with that
road."  
"That's strange. You said you live in this town, so you should know the
roads here. Didn't you come with us as a guide?"  
"Yes, but...I'm not really familiar with that area..."  
"Then why are you at this dead end? This is the back alley where your
house is supposed to be."  
  
We're near the place where we first encountered Lily-chan. I remember
her saying her house is in this back alley around here. I was the one
who led her here, but she must have known that there was a dead end
ahead. Yet, she looked surprised earlier, as if she didn't know there
was going to be one.  
  
"...Yes, that's right. I'm not from this town."  
  
Poco-chan admitted it, but she doesn't seem to have given up yet.  
  
"Then, let's leave it at that."  
"...You don't believe me."  
"There's no evidence that you're not one of them."  
  
Well, there's also no evidence that she's one of them.  
  
"...This is cruel. I was only being threatened by them..."  
"Hey, Chloe-san. She's saying that...let's believe her."  
  
Seeing Poco-chan pleading with tears in her eyes, Azi-chan said that.  
...Hmm, this isn't working. My gut feeling is still telling me she's
suspicious...  
  
"...Cut the act, Poco. That excuse isn't going to work."  
  
A familiar voice made me turn around in a panic. From the sunny road,
opposite the dimly lit dead end where we are, a figure was walking
towards us. A man about the same height as me, wearing a red hood.  
  
"Haah...master. It's cruel of you to ruin all my hard work."  
  
The tears from before are gone. Poco-chan’s ears drooped, and she spoke
in a listless tone, completely different from before.  
  
"Fufufu, I like breaking things, you see."  
"...That's why you always get scolded by him, right?"  
  
From their conversation, it's clear they're not meeting for the first
time. ―I see.  
  
"Poco-chan, you seem to be one of them."  
"...I didn't intend to reveal myself..."  
  
Poco-chan put on a red robe she took out from somewhere.  
  
"Let me introduce myself...I'm a usually faceless member of the
\[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\]. It's precisely because I'm supposed to be
unidentifiable that I didn't want to reveal myself, but..."  
  
Her way of speaking is familiar. She's one of that mismatched duo, the
smaller one.  
  
"...You're the other half from back then, aren't you?"  
"What are you saying? Are you mistaking me for someone else, or rather,
mistaking my hood?"  
"Ah, so you did go. To the forest..."  
"No! I didn't! It's true! Seriously!"  
"...I like that about you, you're so stubborn about giving up. Hearing
that just makes me want to bully you even more."  
"I hate that about you, Master..."  
  
It seems that that man is superior in terms of position. That's what I
feel from his words and attitude, or rather, it feels more like a power
imbalance. I get the feeling Poco-chan is a little afraid of him.  
  
"Still, you’ve been lying from the beginning. Despite being on the
perpetrator's side, you pretended to be a victim..."  
"It's true that I was a victim of that bat woman. My job was to
eliminate her after all. It ended safely thanks to Chloe-san and the
others. I-I really appreciate it. However...it should have been over,
but someone went to all that trouble and couldn't even steal a single
key!?”  
  
Poco-chan glared at the man.  
  
"Ahaha, sorry. I missed the one-third roulette, you see. I’m supposed to
be lucky...but not this time."  
  
He answered in a playful tone without any sign of remorse. If the key
had been successfully stolen, Poco-chan might have disappeared without
revealing her true identity.  
  
"Shall we stop talking? ...Can I have the key back?"  
"...No way!"  
  
As soon as she said that, Poco-chan started running towards the dead-end
wall. Then...she effortlessly jumped over the high wall.  
  
"Wha...? That height!?"  
"Fufu, no need to act cute anymore. This height...is nothing to me!"  
  
A white rabbit looked down from the top of the wall. …I underestimated
the jumping power of a rabbit.  
  
"Well then, Master! I'll leave the rest to you!"  
"Ah, wait! I won't let you get away!"  
  
Azi-chan chased after the rabbit that disappeared over the wall.
Azi-chan is also a beastperson. Her physical abilities are comparable to
Poco-chan's, and she tried to jump over the wall, but...  
  
"You can't forget about me, you know~"  
  
At that moment, a fireball flew towards Azi-chan, who was trying to jump
over the wall. As soon as it hit her, she was suddenly hit with an
explosion.  
  
"Azi!"  
"Wha...what...? This is...instant death...? No way!?"  
  
A violent flame engulfed Azi-chan in an instant, and then her body fell
to the ground. Yes...the moment she was enveloped in flames, she had
taken an attack that completely took out all her HP.  
  
As a party member, her HP is always displayed on the left side of the
screen... but I saw it just disappear.  
  
"Don't ignore me. I won't ignore you anymore either—Chloe."  
  
The man in the red hood approached me with a childlike smile on his
face.
