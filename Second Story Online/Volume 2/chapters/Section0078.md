# 78・That Man

"Ahahahaha! Those two were whispering about something, so I came to see
what was up... and I was right! I never expected to find you here."  
  
The bright red hood and robe seem to be the uniform of their
organization. The mismatched pair that showed up later were wearing the
same outfit. That's why I wasn't sure if this man was the same person
from before, but now I know for certain.  
  
—This is the man from back then. The man who tried to break the seal and
turned Lucille-san into a red beast.  
  
"Master, what are you doing...?"  
"Oh, I think I've seen that tall guy before."  
"W-what are you saying? You must have the wrong person!"  
  
Another person in a red hood and robe appeared next to that man. He
looks like one of the mismatched pair from before. He's tall, making the
man next to him look smaller. They really are a mismatched pair.  
Well, even without that, the man is about my height, making the
difference in height more noticeable.  
  
"Do you know her? Hmm... did you go to the forest?"  
"W-what are you talking about? I never even thought about taking credit
for anything, not even a little bit! B-but more importantly, master, now
isn't the time for that!"  
"Well... that's true."  
  
After glancing at the flustered tall man, the man turned to Saval-kun.  
  
"To ignore me... you have quite the nerve!"  
  
I raised my staff and cast a spell. The fast-casting \[Wind Cutter\]
flew towards him—but—  
  
"Oops, that was close."  
  
A purple barrier, like a protective shield, appeared around the man in
the red hood. It looks like the \[Barrier Magic\] \[Protective
Barrier\]. My spell was blocked.  
  
"Ruthless. What would you have done if you had hit an ally?"  
"He's a thief. I wouldn't have cared even if I had hit him."  
"Ahaha, that's true. But you surely wouldn't do the same to the person
behind you."  
"What are you—"  
  
A whooshing sound came from behind. Alarmed by the sound, I quickly
turned around.  
  
"Wha… Kyle-san?!"  
  
Kyle-san swung his sword down at me. I managed to avoid it. The reason
for Kyle-san's attack became clear immediately.  
  
"...I'm...sorry...Chloe..."  
  
His breath was ragged, and his eyes, usually a gentle blue, were filled
with a crazed red.  
  
"Damn, what's going on?! My body isn't listening to me!"  
  
All I could hear was Rush-san's panicked voice and the sounds of others'
distress.  
...Now I understand why the others didn't stop those in red hoods... The
mist cleared, and I noticed the surrounding situation. Everyone was
affected by the red mist.  
  
"It's strange, though. You're maintaining your sanity in this
situation... From the looks of it, you don't even seem to have any
amulets or anything."  
  
…That's what I was wondering too. But the answer is already clear.  
  
The status effect in the upper right corner. Just as I thought, the
\[Chaos\] abnormal status effect appeared, then immediately disappeared,
replaced by another icon.  
  
It was a buff called \[Starstone's Protection\]. …As you can see from
this buff, my power as a guardian is at work. It seems my guardian power
negates this level of Chaos. That power must be why Lucille-san was able
to stay alive, even when she was on the verge of death.  
  
I thought I heard him chuckle. ...Ah, this is a prediction I don't want
to be true.  
  
Still, amulets. Apparently, having an amulet prevents Chaos even in this
mist. That's probably why those guys were able to stay sane in this
situation as well.  
  
"You seem to know about the boy with the amulet."  
"Hmm? I don't remember anyone like that. Hey, do you know?"  
  
He turned to the tall man next to him. ...Wasn't it this guy who
kidnapped Klin-kun?  
  
"Master, we don't have time for these guys. If we don't go back quickly,
we'll get in trouble."  
"It's true that angering him again is best avoided. Well then, it's a
shame I can't play with you... but why don't you play with him for a
while instead?"  
"Wait, answer my question—ggh?!"  
  
A blow struck me. Kyle-san's \[Shield Bash\] hit me directly. Such a
merciless attack. I got stunned for five seconds. I couldn't do
anything. Another attack approached.  
  
"You're making me do all the work for you!"  
  
The one who cut in front of me was none other than Light-kun. He
skillfully blocked Kyle-san's sword with his large greatsword.  
  
"Sword Counter!"  
  
Apparently, that was a skill. Light-kun's greatsword, now glowing blue,
pushed Kyle-san back, sending him flying into a wall.  
  
"Hey, are you okay? And you aren't going crazy or anything?"  
"Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you, Light-kun."  
  
Light-kun seems perfectly normal. It's probably because he's a hero. The
greatsword he's currently holding isn't the hero's sword,
unfortunately... but even so, he shone brilliantly just now. About the
size of a small light bulb.  
  
"And thank you, Niru, for letting me know about the danger."  
  
Niru, flying near me, had chirped to warn me of the danger. If it
weren't for that sound, I might not have avoided the attack. He shook
his head as if it was nothing, then faced a certain direction with a
grim expression. That's right, it's not over yet.  
  
"Now, can I have the keys you stole returned?"  
"That's—ggh?!"  
  
Saval-kun, who was tied up and held by the man by the collar, was also
affected by the Chaos.  
  
"Hmm. So you don't care what happens to those people."  
"What…are…you…talking…about…!"  
"Are you trying to play dumb? You stole that key to protect those
workers, right? To prevent it from falling into our hands—"  
"Master, let's get out of here quickly. They're starting to come to
their senses."  
"...That's true. It's a pain to look for the key anyway, so let's just
take this guy with us."  
  
Taking advantage of the confusion, they escaped with Saval-kun.  
  
"Niru, go outside and look for them! They shouldn't have gone far!"  
  
Niru quickly flew outside. Perhaps because he's my familiar, he wasn't
affected by the Chaos. I'll monitor Niru's sight through my peripheral
vision while trying to bring the situation in the room under control.  
  
"It's mostly under control here, Chloe-chan!"  
"Miranda-san. And Earl..."  
  
Miranda-san and Earl were throwing potions at the people affected by the
Chaos. Those potions were the ones I made, containing holy water.  
  
"But I only gave Miranda-san one, didn't I...?"  
"I bought some from you before, right? They're from the store, but I
brought some with me just in case~"  
  
I see. That's why those two with the potions were able to cure the
Chaos.  
  
"But do you have any more potions? At this rate, it might be faster to
just knock them unconscious..."  
  
Miranda-san said that as she took out a hammer. What? Are you going to
hit them with that?  
  
"Will I get paid for the potions?"  
  
I'd like to get some money for the potions. ...I also carry a lot of
lake water with me for potion making, so I could use that too… but I
don't want to use it. It's almost as good as holy water. I'm sure
someone will say something if I do. Especially Miranda-san.  
  
Let's just pretend I don't want to use such precious potions.  
  
"You can just bill me later. I was planning to do that anyway, and I'd
even help with the collection if you'd like~?"  
  
I guess my message got through to her because Miranda-san said that to
me. That's reassuring.  
  
"Then I won't hesitate."  
  
I used the holy water potions on those affected by the Chaos. I used
them on the El Dorado members as well as the guards.  
  
Even if we left it alone, they would probably recover after a while, but
there was the danger of being hit with a hammer before that, right? Of
course, please pay for the potions later.  
  
"I'm sorry... I caused you trouble."  
"It couldn't be helped in that situation."  
  
The Chaos in the room subsided. Kyle-san seemed to have come to his
senses and came to apologize for his earlier actions.  
  
—Now the problem is...  
  
"What should we do? Saval was taken away!"  
"Calm down, Azi. He'll be alright."  
  
Azi-chan and Bluey-kun were worried and panicking because their friend
had been taken.
