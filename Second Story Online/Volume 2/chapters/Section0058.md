# 58・Let’s Start a Farm

After finishing our shopping, we returned to the Twilight Forest.  
  
*‘Chloe, let’s purify the poison.’*  
  
As Lucille-san instructed, we went to the lakeside. Apparently, this is
where the poison could be purified.  
  
*‘As I mentioned before, the bottom of this lake holds the \[Sealed
Starstone\]. Its power resides in the lake water as well. It’s
comparable to even the most powerful holy water. We’ll use it to draw a
magic circle.’*  
  
So the \[Sealed Starstone\] had that kind of power. I sprinkled water
onto the ground and, on the damp earth, drew the magic circle as
instructed. Earl helped me.  
  
I placed the poison in the center of the circle.  
  
*‘After that, touch the magic circle and make your wish.’*  
  
I touched the magic circle with both hands. The Guardian's mark on the
back of my hand glowed, and the magic circle shone brightly. The lake
shimmered in response. The ominous contents of the poison in the center
of the magic circle rapidly lost its color and became transparent.  
  
“Amazing! To think it has such power…”  
  
When I appraised the purified poison with the \[Alchemy\] skill, it
turned out to be just water.  
  
*‘It’s similar to the purification power a hero possesses. It’s easy to
do this much.’*  
“I see… Then, could it purify the power of Chaos?”  
*‘Hmm… Though they originate from the same source, it’s only similar.
It’s still no match for the purification power of a hero.’*  
  
So the power of a hero is truly special. But the lake's water certainly
has the power to purify to some extent.  
  
Now that the poison purification is finished, the next task is making
the requested cold medicine.  
  
To make the cold medicine, I need to gather the ingredients. Gathering
them like before is an option, but doing that every time would be a
pain.  
  
So let's make a herb garden. This way, I won't have to forage.  
There's a garden near the house in the forest that Lucille-san had taken
care of. Perhaps because it hadn't been tended to for a long time, it
was completely overgrown.  
  
But it's less work than cultivating a garden from scratch. I'll use it.
There's also a complete set of gardening tools, so I’ll gratefully use
them.  
Earl helped me too. Earl wielding a hoe looks like a farmer; it suits
him. And he was efficient.  
  
As for me…  
  
“Okay… Whoa!”  
  
The moment I lifted the hoe with too much momentum, I lost my balance
and fell on my butt.  
  
Perhaps because I’m a magic user with low strength, I couldn't move as I
wanted. I should have considered the character's stats a little more… It
seems Chloe is not cut out for farming.  
  
“It’s okay.”  
  
I said that to Earl who came over to me out of concern. He offered his
hand, and I gratefully took it to get up. I brushed off the dirt on my
skirt.  
  
Earl pointed to a nearby stump as if to say I could sit there, and
returned to tilling the garden.  
  
“I never thought I’d be this physically weak…”  
  
As I sat on the stump, I couldn't help but sigh.  
  
Listening closely, I heard the rustling of the forest trees swaying in
the breeze. Even though it's a game, it feels like I’m in a real forest.
And in that forest, Earl is diligently tilling the garden, and if I look
up at the sky, I can see Niru sleeping comfortably on a tree branch.  
  
But I'm in trouble. The garden is quite large. I can't leave it all to
Earl alone. And it seems I can't help out...  
  
“There’s no rule saying you have to till with a hoe.”  
  
I looked down and saw the black cat named Lucille-san. …Come to think of
it, this garden originally belonged to Lucille-san. And Lucille-san,
like me, is a magic user.  
  
“Ah, I see.”  
  
That’s right, you don't have to till with a hoe. After all, there's this
convenient thing called magic.  
  
I changed my equipment from the hoe to my staff. I aimed the staff at
the garden and began chanting. The spell is the earth magic \[Quake\].
The chanting time is four seconds. The moment the chant ended, the spell
activated, and the ground in the area swelled, and the earth cracked.  
  
"This may have been a bit of a mistake."  
*‘…It would seem so.’*  
  
I suppose you could call it tilling. But it also looks like I just
cracked the ground… Is there no magic for farming?  
  
At any rate, I tilled enough for the necessary area of the garden. After
I used magic over a wide area, Earl tidied it up.  
  
Oh yeah, I also used the fertilizer I bought from Miranda-san's shop.
Using this magical fertilizer supposedly improves plant quality and
accelerates growth. Could I make this with the \[Alchemy\] skill? Or
maybe it's also in the realm of the \[Enchanting\] skill?  
  
Now, let’s sow the seeds. From here on, even I can do it. All I have to
do is sow the seeds and water them.  
  
The seeds I'm sowing are those I’ve collected so far. I used
\[Appraisal: Plants\] to identify what kind of seeds they were before
planting them. This time, it’s three types: herbs for the cold medicine,
white herb, and red grass.  
  
Then I watered them. Of course, I used the lake water. Hopefully, some
beneficial effect will be achieved.  
  
“Oh… it’s already this late.”  
  
I checked the time when the gardening was almost finished and was
startled. I need to log out soon.  
After cleaning up, I logged out. I wonder how the garden will look when
I log in next.
