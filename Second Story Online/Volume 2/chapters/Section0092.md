# 92・Phantom City (1)

\*This is a rather meta discussion, but it's a meta discussion about the
game from a demon character's perspective.  
  
\*Please consider everything that happens in the game to be a play
within a play.  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
A day has passed since then. I logged out around the time things in the
Iru mining town settled down.  
  
  
It’s currently undergoing maintenance. After waiting a while, the
maintenance finally ended. I was about to get started, but then I found
some interesting information in the maintenance details notice.  
  
《Thank you for always playing SSO. This is the SSO operating team. With
the completion of today's maintenance, we have implemented the "Phantom
City" as a server for “user interaction," as has been requested for some
time.》  
  
A server for user interaction? ...Reading the explanation, it seems to
be a special server detached from the game space.  
  
The reason why we needed a server like this… is mainly because in SSO,
which has many role-players, interactions between players in the game is
difficult.  
  
In order to create immersion, they made it so that NPCs and players are
indistinguishable. As a result, it’s unclear whether the other person is
a player or an NPC, the characters being controlled might be
antagonistic and therefore unable to talk, or there might be players who
simply don’t want to have meta-talk in the game... These are problems
unique to SSO.  
  
Until now, player interaction has mostly been done outside the game, but
apparently there were many requests for an official place for this, and
so this interaction server’s been created.  
  
This interaction server allows you to use the same character models that
you use in the game. Since you have to pay a licensing fee to take them
outside, it's nice that there's no need for that here. However, it seems
that you can't use skills, etc.  
  
Moreover, people who aren't game users can also enter as guests. SSO
currently has a limit on the number of players, but it will eventually
be unlimited. This server is likely an attempt to give prospective new
users a feel for the game. ...It would be nice to invite that girl.  
  
Ah, this server... no, let's call it Phantom City. The setting has also
been released. Apparently, this Phantom City exists in the space between
reality and dreams, a place you can go to while dreaming.  
  
The fact that they made a setting that connects to the game world is
typical of this company. The reason this setting exists is apparently
because not only game users but also NPCs can visit.  
  
The official website is live-streaming the current state of the Phantom
City. It seems that some users are already logged in, and various races
of people can be seen walking and talking in the white city.  
  
Hmm...? Wait...? Is that Lucille-san?!  
  
What's going on? While watching the switching live footage, I saw
Lucille-san. And she's an old woman. There's even an orc next to her.
Surely that's not Earl.  
  
I can't just stand by. To get to the bottom of things, I connected to
the interaction server instead of the game server.  
  
  
◇ ◇ ◇  
  
  
"Whoa..."  
  
I couldn’t help but let out a sound. The place I logged into was a plaza
even bigger than the square you start out in in Dairode Town. All kinds
of people were passing through the plaza, and the ground is paved with
white cobblestone.  
  
In the center were large statues modeled after the five heroes—the star
heroes who once saved the world. ...They look exactly like the people in
the SSO commercial. So those were the heroes...  
  
My eyes were drawn to one of them. An elf witch. It seems that the
person I admire is the same as you, Chloe. I think her name was...
Astrea?  
  
A band was playing upbeat music under the statue. The atmosphere is like
a festival.  
  
I think this city is exactly the same as the holy city in the game.
Speaking of the holy city, it’s the headquarters of the Star Church,
isn't it?  
  
"Oh, excuse me."  
  
While gazing at the cityscape I was seeing for the first time, I bumped
into someone next to me... No, is it a person? It's a tree with green
leaves on its head.  
  
"My apologies. My vision is limited because of these leaves..."  
  
The humanoid tree apologized and then left with its companion—a fish...?
A giant fish swimming in the air. ...The tree person is a treant, right?
The fish is a monster too.  
  
They seem to be monster-side players. Since this is an interaction
server, monsters and demons are also gathering. As a result, it's become
a city of strange and frightening creatures... This is a sight you'd
absolutely never see in the in-game holy city.  
  
I could tell at a glance that those monsters were players, because the
cursors representing them were green.  
  
In this server, players and NPCs are distinguishable; players are shown
in green, and NPCs in blue. GMs are red, apparently.  
  
"I never thought I'd find you two here."  
  
Pushing through the crowd, I found the two people I was looking for and
spoke to them.  
  
"Oh, if it isn’t Chloe. To meet you here in this Phantom City of all
places."  
  
Lucille-san’s wrinkles deepend as she gave a carefree smile. And there
was Earl waving happily. Looking closely at their feet, I could see
Belle.  
  
"Well, even though this is a city in a dream... It's been a while since
I last saw the holy city. It's still as beautiful as ever."  
  
The target circle color around Lucille-san is blue. And Earl and Belle
were blue as well. It seems that they are genuine NPCs.  
  
"That's true. ...Now that I think about it, Niru isn't here."  
  
Since Belle is here, it wouldn't be strange if Niru was here too...  
  
"Do you think that fellow would come to such a noisy place?"  
"......No."  
  
That's Niru for you. Even if it's a dream, Niru, who seems to prefer
quiet places, is unlikely to come. He might come if there was food
here... You don't have to be so faithful to the character, do you?  
  
Well, I can't confirm Niru, but he’s definitely an NPC.  
  
*‘...Hello, I've just logged in. Where are you?’*  
  
At that moment, I heard a voice in my ear. It’s my friend.  
  
*‘Oh, sorry. Please wait in the center of the plaza for now.’*  
*‘Yes, understood.’*  
  
I'll end the conversation with my friend there for now. The reason my
friend is here is because I called her earlier. I had previously
recommended that she play SSO. I thought it would be a good way to show
her what kind of game SSO is before she started.  
  
"Hmm, you seem to have some business to take care of. We'll just wander
around, so feel free to talk to us if you need anything."  
"Yes, understood."  
"Ah, that's right. I forgot to say one thing."  
  
Lucille-san said that as if she had just remembered.  
  
"This is a city of illusions, between reality and dreams. The memories
of this city will be forgotten like a fleeting dream when you wake up.
Therefore, there may be those who act differently than usual, but don't
worry too much about it. They'll forget it all anyway. Of course, that
goes for you too. I think it's good to let loose a little in your
dreams."  
  
After giving what seemed like a typical NPC explanation, Lucille-san
disappeared into the crowd with Earl and Belle. ...Considering her words
just now, was that advice to not worry even if we aren't role-playing?
And advice that it's alright even if we don't role-play…?  
  
I don't know the true meaning behind Lucille-san's words, but this is an
interaction server. So I think it's okay to not role-play from the
start. The setting is that memories aren't retained. ...Even if it
doesn't stay with the character, it will remain in the player's memory,
so I'll have to be careful not to accidentally mention it during the
game.  
  
"...Um, Chloe, right?"  
  
As I headed towards the center, someone called my name, and when I
turned around, there was a girl who looked like a very ordinary town
girl. She has a slightly hesitant expression with her palm against her
cheek.  
  
Chloe doesn't recognize the girl, but I do. The target circle's color is
green. At the same time, the ID displayed was not a game user ID but a
guest ID. I recognize that ID number.  
  
"Sorry, I was talking to an acquaintance... Sorry to keep you
waiting."  
"Well, that's good. I thought you might have forgotten about me."  
"There's no way I would do something like that."  
"Fufu, just a joke."  
  
She laughed as she said that. My friend's appearance must be a guest
avatar. It's the kind of appearance where the lack of features is a
feature, and in this city where many players are currently gathered, it
actually stands out.  
  
"Thank you for coming at this time. ...It's 1 a.m. where you are,
right?"  
"No, it's fine. Besides, I was curious. About that game you're so
into."  
  
The maintenance ended at midnight world time. It's 1 p.m. where I am,
but it's 1 a.m. where she is.  
  
"By the way, “Chloe” really is a cute girl who suits a witch-like
appearance."  
"Isn't that right?"  
  
I twirled around on the spot, a little boastfully. I was just praised
for the character I had created. Of course I'm happy.  
  
"Yes, that's true. I agree with that opinion too."  
  
And with that, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed knight in armor appeared.  
  
"...Oh, it's Kyle-san."  
"I wonder, is it my imagination that I can hear some disappointment in
that remark...?"  
  
His handsome face had a slightly hurt expression. His appearance is
still that of a handsome knight, but...  
  
"It's definitely because of that cheesy acting. Old man Kyle."  
  
Appearing next to Kyle-san was Light-kun. The way his eyes look like
he’s seeing something unfortunate is the same as the way I must look
right now. He looks a little sleepy. ...Considering the time difference,
it must be morning where Light-kun is.  
  
"...Haah, what the heck is this. I was just acting the role of "Kyle,"
you know. Look at the character properly, not the inside, the character,
you know."  
  
The refreshing scent that was there a moment ago is gone. An old man who
seems to be about to start smelling of old age has appeared. The same
appearance yet...  
  
"I went to the trouble of complimenting you and saying you were
cute..."  
"It was “Kyle” who praised me. Not you."  
"At times like this, you really need to look at the character... well,
you're right. I think she's cute, but Chloe isn't really my type."  
"Oh, what kind of girl do you like then?"  
"Of course, a mature, beautiful woman with a great figure!"  
  
Ah—...That's far from Chloe. But please don't say things like that so
bluntly. Your appearance is “Kyle,” you know. Ah, a minor character
collapse. Well, it's not the first time...  
  
"Chloe, who are these people?"  
"They're both role-players I met in the game. This is my friend."  
"Nice to meet you, I'm Chloe's friend. I don't have a name to use here
yet, so please forgive my lack of introduction."  
  
After introducing herself to the two of them, my friend looked at them
with interest.  
  
"No, no, don't worry about it. My name is Kyle. I'm traveling while
training to be a knight, hoping to become like my father, who was a
royal knight."  
  
Kyle-san instantly removed his old-age smell and returned to being a
refreshing young knight. His skill at switching is amazing. He doesn't
look like the old man who was just talking about the kind of women he
likes.  
  
"Uh... I'm, ah, cough...—My name is Light. I'm a hero chosen by the Star
Sword Rex, who will destroy the evil of this world, bring light to the
world, and eventually leave my name in history!"  
  
Light-kun, on the other hand, stumbled a little but tried his best to
role-play. ...Watching him makes me want to cheer him on.  
  
"By the way, you haven't introduced yourself, 'Chloe'."  
"...Eh?"  
  
My friend is looking at me with expectant eyes. Are you telling me to do
it?  
  
Then I shall answer those expectations!  
  
"Well then, let me introduce myself. My name is Chloe. I admire the
heroine witch Astrea, so I gave up my noble status and went on a
journey. At the end of my adventure, I met a mage I can call my teacher,
and I'm currently training in magic under her. In the future, I want to
become a great mage...no, a witch!"  
"Oh, you're all amazing!"  
  
My friend clapped her hands, her eyes sparkling. It was a little
embarrassing to do it in front of people I know, but it was worth the
effort.  
  
"So, Chloe was a noble... I see. You were wearing a dress when we first
met, and you did have a refined feel..."  
"It'll come back to bite me, you see. Because I listed running away from
home on my background."  
  
Come to think of it, I’ve never talked about being a noble. Kyle-san
nodded in understanding.  
  
"By the way... what are you doing there, Tsubaki-san?"  
"Wha!?"  
  
In the direction of my gaze, hidden behind the statue's pedestal, was
Tsubaki-san, who had been peeking at us from time to time.
