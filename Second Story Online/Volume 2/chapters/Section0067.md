# 67・I’m Not a Stalker

"Alright, another failure!"  
  
I'm probably the only one who would shout with glee in the face of a
culinary disaster. Before me is a plume of black smoke and a failure—no,
what emerged is something far from a dish.  
  
It's called \[Dark Soup\]! Compared to the previous one, it inflicts
fewer abnormal statuses. It’s the result of adjusting the ingredients.  
  
Several more pots of \[Dark Soup\] were sitting on the table. Hell has
been created here. Each one inflicts a different number of abnormal
statuses—from a maximum of ten to a minimum of three.  
  
Why am I mass-producing this? Naturally, to utilize the effect of my
dark magic skill, \[Dark Compensation\]. Each abnormal status boosts my
attack and magic attack power, so it'd be convenient to be able to apply
abnormalities at will. That's why I'm making so many failed dishes.  
  
However… the taste is a problem. I really want to do something about
that, but I can't. Even without tasting it, I know it's terrible.  
  
"You're a terrible cook, aren't you?"  
"Huh?"  
  
Lucille-san muttered that, facing the table that had turned into hell.
...It's true that I’m doing it on purpose, but Chloe's constant failures
at cooking may mean she's just bad at it.  
  
"Well, I can manage simple things... but elaborate dishes are difficult.
Maybe it's because I'm approaching it with the same mindset as
alchemy?"  
  
So, now Chloe has the added setting of being bad at cooking. I'll be
role-playing her like this from now on.  
  
……This means, with the bad cook role-play, I can legally force this onto
others, right?  
  
"While you're here, would you like to try some, Niru?"  
  
He vehemently refused by shaking his head at high speed. Even the
gluttonous Niru doesn't want this.  
  
"How about Earl?"  
  
Upon asking, he froze. He seemed to be agonizing over whether or not to
eat it. Then, timidly, he put out his hand as if to take the bowl I was
holding.  
  
"...Let's not do it after all. This is a failure."  
  
I'd feel sorry for making him eat it, so I stopped him. But I'm very
happy that he was willing to try it. That's enough for me.  
  
But I can't give up. I really want someone to try it. …Alright, next
time I see Kyle-san, I'll offer him this dish under the guise of a taste
test. I'm already looking forward to the role-play he'll deliver.  
  
Well, that's enough about the cooking. If all I need are abnormal
statuses, I have the poison and paralysis potions I made before. But
those are difficult because I built up resistance. Plus, the soup can
inflict three or four abnormal statuses at once.  
  
Oh, speaking of which, I made cold medicine the other day... Could I
make a "cold-inducing medicine" instead? The ingredients for the cold
medicine are medicinal herbs, red grass, and white herb. By the way,
eating these three ingredients directly has the same effect as the cold
medicine thanks to the \[Herbivore\] skill. What is Herbivore
anyways...?  
  
I was able to make poison and other things using Lady Black. So, I'll
try making it by substituting Lady Black for the white herb.  
  
It failed... It seems I can't make it just by adding Lady Black. Is the
medicinal herb the problem? If so, I'll try adding Paralysis Herb
instead.  
  
Apparently, that was the key. The \[Cold-inducing medicine\] is
complete! Now I can catch a cold whenever I want. Meaning, I can take a
break whenever I want, then cure myself with the cold medicine.  
  
"...I need to go see Miranda-san."  
  
I also have the potion delivery she asked for. So, let's go to her
shop.  
  
I'll go on my broom, naturally. Lucille-san and I were on the broom.
Niru was leading the way while looking slightly sleepy. Earl is walking
on the ground in case we fall.  
  
Since I'm still not very good at controlling it, I’m flying slowly
through the forest sky. A gentle breeze passed through, ruffling my hair
and clothes. Flying slowly isn't so bad.  
  
When I was about to run out of MP near the edge of the forest, I decided
to land. I was thinking of restoring my MP with a potion and flying
again, when…  
  
"That's…"  
  
I spotted someone walking on the plains leading to the town. It was
someone I know very well.  
  
"Isn't that Klin-kun?"  
"Oh, Chloe-san! Hello!"  
  
Upon seeing me, he brightened up and ran towards me. It seems he got
attached to me ever since the cold medicine incident the other day.  
  
"Chloe-san, what are you doing in this forest...? Ah, are you collecting
medicinal herbs?"  
"Yes, that's right."  
  
In fact, this forest is actually my home ground. Because I'm its
guardian.  
...But I can't say that, so I'll just go along with him.  
  
"But Klin-kun, more importantly, what are you doing here? And that
sword...?"  
"Ah, this is for self-defense. I'm going to the Iru mining town."  
"The mining town?"  
"Yes, a shipment from a merchant in the mining town hasn't arrived...
It's a bit urgent, so I'm planning to go and get it myself."  
"I see. But will you be alright alone?"  
  
Of course, monsters appear in the area leading to the mines. I'm very
worried about whether Klin-kun will be able to get through by himself.  
  
"I know a safe route, so I'll be fine. Plus, I have some church-blessed
\[Holy Water\] and a \[Protective Amulet\]."  
  
He pointed to a blue stone fragment hanging around his neck. \[Holy
Water\] and a \[Protective Amulet\]… are those things really
effective?  
  
"But are you really sure? You only just recovered from your cold."  
"My cold is completely cured thanks to Chloe-san's medicine. Chloe-san
says the same thing as the shop owner."  
  
Miranda-san must have been worried and tried to stop him. I know
Klin-kun is responsible, but he looks like a cute boy, so I can't help
but worry about him.  
  
"Well, I'll be going now. I'll be back soon, so don't worry."  
"Yes, please be careful."  
  
Saying that, Klin-kun made his way deeper into the forest. He seems to
know the way, heading towards the mine exit.  
  
…But I ended up worrying and secretly followed him to the exit. That
way, the forest monsters won't attack Klin-kun. …I'm definitely not
stalking him.  
  
After seeing Klin-kun off at the exit, I went to Miranda-san's shop.  
  
"Welcome~…"  
  
As expected, a somewhat restless Miranda-san greeted me. When I told her
about Klin-kun, she calmed down, looking relieved.  
  
"Here are the potions you requested. And, I also have this
\[Cold-inducing medicine\]..."  
"Oh~, \[Cold-inducing medicine\]. Can I have a look?"  
  
The Miranda-san who was just worried about Klin-kun is gone. The
merchant Miranda-san, with shining eyes, examined the medicine I made.  
  
She bought the requested potions and three \[Cold-inducing medicines\].
However, because it's a cold-inducing medicine, she's avoiding openly
selling it, and will only sell it to trustworthy customers who seem to
need it.
