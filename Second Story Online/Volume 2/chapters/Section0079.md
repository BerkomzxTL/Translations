# 79・Truth Revealed

"By the way... you know why Saval-kun was targeted by them, right? Could
it have something to do with Oliver-kun's stolen ore?"  
  
The two bound individuals exchanged glances, seemingly troubled about
what to do.  
  
"...That..."  
"I'll tell you. Saval intended to as well... but I have a request in
exchange for telling you."  
"What is it?"  
"After you hear the story, I want you to cooperate with us. Ideally, I'd
like you to free us too. We want to go save Saval."  
"You say that, but what do you think we should do?"  
  
I looked at Friday-san, Rush-san, and Oliver-kun.  
  
"Why should we get involved in this...?"  
"Now, now, Rush. Think of this as another quest and cooperate with them.
In fact, their approach to this game is more correct."  
"I don't think there's a 'correct' way to play the game... but as long
as I get my ore back, that’s fine with me. Though I won't forgive them
for stealing it!"  
  
Oliver-kun didn't seem to forgive them, but he doesn’t seem opposed to
getting their help with this matter.  
  
"Then, will you tell us?"  
"Yes. First, regarding us stealing his ore, Oliver-san's ore... we were
doing it because we received a request. The client was a foreman who
manages a large mining site in this town."  
"...Could it be Johnny?"  
"Yes, Johnny-san."  
  
Oliver-kun reacted in surprise.  
  
"Do you know him?"  
"Yeah, a little. He's the kind of NPC that any player who has a workshop
in this town will encounter at least once."  
  
According to Bluey-kun’s story… the trio of thieves, \[Shiokaze\],
received a request from this man named Johnny. The request was to steal
the \[Moonlight Stone\] that Oliver-kun found.  
  
"...Johnny knew I had that ore. I just remembered that I mentioned it
when I was coming out of the mine entrance. Now that I think about it,
Johnny did ask to buy my ore. I thought he was joking so I brushed it
off, but..."  
"It seems like he really wanted it and wasn’t just kidding."  
  
He even went so far as to make a request. There must have been a good
reason.  
  
"...An NPC making such a request? It’s already created a conflict
between players... it's like the last time... this is strange."  
"This game is like that. There are quite a few requests that cause
conflicting objectives... NPCs often give out quests that can easily
lead to PVP."  
  
Rush-san and Friday-san commented on this after hearing the story.  
  
Indeed, both the last time and this time, it resulted in players
fighting each other. Whether it was intentional is unclear... but in
this game, you often find yourself in PVP.  
  
Well, whether it actually becomes PVP depends on the players. Last time,
we could have avoided it if we wanted to. We can probably avoid it this
time as well. ...However, it's impossible to avoid if the red-hooded
group, who are clearly enemies, are also players.  
  
"So, why did he give you such a request?"  
"...At first, we didn't know either. We understood after getting the ore
and going to his mansion... it seems he was being threatened by those
guys in the red hoods."  
"Threatened?"  
"I don't know the details... At first they asked him to mine some ore
for them. However, it seems they gradually forced him to do the work by
using the lives of his workers as leverage."  
  
The purpose of the red-hooded group is unknown, but apparently they
needed a large amount of ore resources. It seems that they initially
bought the ore... but they must have run out of funds, so Bluey-kun said
they started threatening the workers to force them to continue mining.  
  
"And, they... demanded mining in the restricted area."  
"Restricted area?"  
"...A restricted area is a mining area that is prohibited from entry, as
the name suggests."  
  
Oliver-kun seemed to know and explained the restricted area to us.  
  
"It's near the deepest part of the mine. The reason for this is...
there's a powerful raid-level monster there. The first generation
players tried to defeat it many times, but they all failed. The lord of
this town saw this and sealed it off because it was dangerous."  
  
So that's the reason... I never thought the actions of the first group
of players would cause such a situation.  
  
“Ah, you mean the demonic beast, \[Willamedes\]. A special monster
resulting from a mutation of the Stone Roller species, wasn't it...?"  
"Friday-san, you know about it?"  
"I'm a member of the first group, so I fought that monster before.
Unfortunately, I couldn't defeat it..."  
  
So Friday-san was a first-generation player. And yet, the Demonic Beast
\[Willamedes\]...  
  
"The reason Johnny-san asked us for help... I think he probably wanted
the ore from the restricted area, and he set his sights on Oliver-san
who happened to have mined the Moonlight Stone, which can be found in
the restricted area."  
"...So that's how it is. Johnny, if that was the reason, you should have
just told me..."  
  
Oliver-kun muttered. Indeed, it would have been better if he had told
Oliver-kun from the beginning.  
  
"I think he couldn't. With those kinds of people, if information gets
out, their lives would be in danger. As a leader, he probably didn't
want to put his subordinates at risk."  
"Hmm... I see..."  
  
Oliver-kun seemed a little convinced by Kyle-san's words.  
  
"So, I understand why you guys took Oliver's ore, but... what did you do
with it?"  
  
Light-kun urged Bluey-kun to continue.  
  
"I'll tell you now. We handed Oliver-san's ore over to Johnny-san. Then
it fell into the hands of the Red Hoods... but it seems that wasn't
their objective."  
"...The ore isn't their objective?"  
"Yes, Johnny-san thought that would be the end of it... but they seemed
to have some business with the restricted area itself. So, they were
threatening Johnny-san who was entrusted with the key to the gate that
seals off the restricted area—"  
"So we stole the key!"  
  
Azi-chan declared this with her chest puffed out.  
  
"...In other words, because you guys stole the key to the gate, and
Saval-kun has the key, he was targeted..."  
"No, I have the key?"  
"...Eh?"  
  
I looked at Azi-chan. And then I looked at Bluey-kun next to her to
confirm if it was true.  
  
"Yes, Azi has the key. She insisted on having it... well, it ended up
not falling into their hands, but..."  
"...So, Saval-kun was kidnapped because they thought he had the
key..."  
  
Well, if you ask who the leader among them is... it's Saval-kun...  
  
"Saval did a great job as bait! To celebrate his achievement, I, the
leader of this bandit group, must go and rescue him!"  
  
Speaking was the self-proclaimed leader Azi-chan.  
  
"So, will you cooperate with us?"  
"From what I’ve heard so far, it seems like our goals are aligned."  
  
We were also worried about Klin-kun, who was kidnapped. And the
red-hooded group seems to be plotting something. As the guardian, and as
Chloe, who dislikes their organization, we should go and crush them.  
  
"Is everyone okay with this?"  
  
Having reached a consensus, we decided to cooperate with the three and
pursue the red-hooded group.  
  
"Ah, finally free!"  
"Thank you for your cooperation."  
  
Having established a cooperative relationship, Azi-chan and Bluey-kun
were untied as promised. Now, we need to find the red-hooded group.  
  
"The question is, where are they..."  
"Probably Johnny-san's house. They seemed to be based there."  
  
Azi-chan answered Kyle-san.  
  
"Hey, did you see Klin? He's a boy with light brown hair, and he was
kidnapped by them..."  
"Umm, we left right away, so I don't know... sorry."  
  
Azi-chan sounded apologetic while replying to Miranda-san.  
Despite being a thief, she seems to have a good heart. And of course the
other two as well.  
  
"But if he was kidnapped too, he's likely with Saval. He might be
somewhere in the mansion."  
"It's only a matter of time before they realize Saval doesn't have the
key. We'd better get going quickly."  
"My ore is there too, right?"  
"I can't be sure because the Red Hoods took it, but probably..."  
  
Bluey-kun answered Oliver-kun with a slightly apologetic look. Is it
because they stole it, or did they feel some guilt? They really aren't
cut out to be thieves.  
  
...Come to think of it, I haven't seen Lucille-san for a while. She's
the type to tell me if there was something going on... I started looking
around for Lucille-san, and Earl came over. He was holding a black cat
in his arms. Upon closer inspection, it didn’t seem to be Lucille-san,
but Belle, the black cat.  
  
"Was Lucille-san's summoning released?"  
  
Earl nodded. He seemed to want to tell us this, but he couldn't bring
himself to do it because we were having a discussion.  
  
*'You finally noticed! I thought you had forgotten about my
existence!'*  
*'I'm sorry about that... we've had a lot going on...'*  
  
It seems the cause of the release is the red mist from earlier. Belle is
a normal cat, so it seems she was affected by it. This caused her to be
unable to stay in Belle's body, and the possession was released.  
  
*'Hmm... I see. It was those guys after all...'*  
*'We've just decided to head to the mansion where they're staying.'*  
  
After briefly explaining the situation to Lucille-san, a loud voice rang
out.  
  
"Damn it! We don't have time for a discussion! Let's think about it
later! Let's go save Klin, Miranda!"  
"Ah, wait, Light-kun!?"  
"Light, again, you're doing things on your own!!"  
  
Apparently having reached his limit, Light-kun grabbed Miranda-san's
hand and ran off. Kyle-san hastily followed him.  
  
"Then let's go as well. To get Oliver’s ore back."  
"Ah, let's finish this troublesome business quickly."  
"I remember Johnny's mansion. I'll guide you."  
  
Friday-san, Rush-san, and the clan members went out. Oliver-kun followed
them.  
  
"Now, let's go save Saval!"  
"Wait, you're seriously going to take the key?"  
  
Poco-chan stopped Azi-chan as she was about to leave.  
  
"Oh, that's right... what should I do with this? Um... where was it?"  
"Azi-chan... you're not going to say you lost it again, are you?"  
"No, no, no... Ah, here it is!"  
  
Azi-chan frantically opened her menu and searched, then took out what
she was looking for. In her hand was a slightly large, black key.  
  
"Is that the gate key?"  
"Yeah, what should I do with this?"  
"Then I'll take it."  
  
It was Poco-chan who suggested that.  
  
"I'll wait here until the situation is resolved, so I'll look after it
until then."  
"Oh～ then I'll leave it to you!"  
  
Azi-chan was about to hand the key to Poco-chan, but...  
  
"Wait. I'll take the key."  
  
I snatched the key from Azi-chan's hand.  
  
"C, Chloe-san? Why...? You're going to the mansion, right? Then it's
better to give it to this girl..."  
"Yes, Chloe. It's safer to leave it to me, right?"  
  
The two looked surprised and confused by my actions.  
  
"...I'm sorry, but I don't trust you, Poco-chan."  
  
Judging from her past actions... I thought I shouldn't hand the key over
to her.  
  
"Heeh....—That's a shame."  
  
—Poco-chan's eyes suddenly sharpened.  
  
"Guh...!"  
  
A shock ran through my abdomen. In an instant, Poco-chan came close to
me and landed a body blow. Even though I was on guard, I couldn't react
to that speed.  
  
"Chloe-san!"  
  
As I was blown away and fell to the ground, I saw Poco-chan snatch the
key and run away, passing by Bluey-kun.  
  
"Azi-chan, chase after her! Your speed should be able to catch her!"  
"O-okay!!"  
  
Azi-chan ran out of the building to chase after her. Her speed is
comparable to Poco-chan's, so she should be able to keep up. I also gave
instructions to Niru outside to follow them.  
  
Still... even though I was suspicious of her and on guard, I made a
mistake. The reason is that she didn't give herself away easily. Did I
wait too long to observe her?  
  
"Bluey-kun, about Saval-kun... I'm sorry. Could you help me with
this?"  
"Sure. I wouldn’t be able to face Saval-kun if we lost the key."  
"...Thank you."  
  
I smiled back at him as he nodded firmly. Then we ran off in a direction
different from the mansion, towards where Poco-chan had fled.
