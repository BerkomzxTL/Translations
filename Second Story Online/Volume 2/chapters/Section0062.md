# 62・The Grand Prize Is a Hero’s Sword

I logged in today and continued making the cold medicine I had started
yesterday. Before that, I'll summon Niru, who had been de-summoned. Oh,
and Lucille-san isn't here either, so I’ll summon her.  
  
"This is..."  
  
After doing what I usually do when I log in, I looked around and noticed
it. The interior is slightly different. Before, the inside of the log
cabin house had Lucille-san's furniture left as it was.  
  
That's why, perhaps, it was a little worn and scratched. But the table
and chairs in front of me now are as good as new.  
  
Furthermore, a lovely tablecloth was spread out, and a blue rose was
arranged in a wooden vase. Even Niru's perch, which was just a few
branches before, seems to have been replaced with something new.  
  
It was just those small things, but I think the atmosphere of this room
has changed drastically.  
  
"...Did Earl do this?"  
  
Earl seemed to be sitting in a chair doing some sewing. There's
something half-finished on the chair.  
Earl was looking at me timidly, as if to ask, "Is it bad?". Despite his
large build, he was hunched over.  
  
"No, I think it's wonderful."  
  
It has a warm atmosphere and is very nice. Besides, I've been wanting to
live in a house like this, so it's perfect.  
  
Well... as a witch's house, the previous simple feel, or even a darker,
somewhat frightening interior might have been fine. But after seeing
this, I can't say that, and if I had to choose, I'd rather live here.  
  
"Hmm, that's right. In fact, I'm glad that you've made my former home so
beautiful!"  
  
Lucille-san's cheerful voice could be heard. Apparently, she also likes
the new interior.  
  
"You seem to be good at this sort of thing."  
  
She lightly hopped onto Earl's shoulder, stroking his head
affectionately as a compliment.  
  
Come to think of it, black cat Lucille-san has a blue ribbon tied around
her neck. Did Earl make that too? It's the same shade as her eyes and
very cute.  
  
Pleased by Lucille-san's praise, Earl nodded in response.  
  
"...Huh? Could it be that Earl can hear Lucille-san's voice now?"  
  
Lucille-san's voice was slightly different. The voice that had been only
in my ear before now sounds as if it's coming from the black cat's
mouth.  
  
Earl also noticed this and nodded slightly in surprise.  
  
"Hmm, my power as a familiar has increased. That's why I can talk to
others besides Chloe now."  
  
I see. Looking closely, I can see that Lucille-san's familiar level has
gone up.  
  
"Well, this just means that I can speak while possessing something."  
  
In other words, it seems nothing has changed in that she can't do
anything without possessing something. Ah... I wish I could summon her
properly.  
  
Now, let's finish making the rest of the cold medicine. After repeating
the simmering process for about two hours, I finally managed to prepare
the promised 100 medicines.  
  
I thought it was better to make the quality even, so they're all 4
stars. 5 star items are difficult to make, and conversely, sometimes
they drop to 3 stars, so it can be difficult to maintain a consistent
quality.  
  
"Oh, that reminds me, watering the garden!"  
  
I was about to go deliver the medicine when I noticed. I haven't watered
the garden yet.  
  
Earl stopped me as I was about to go out. And he was trying to convey
something with gestures. He was moving his hands horizontally as if he
was holding something.  
  
"Did you water the garden?"  
  
Earl nodded.  
  
"I see. Thank you, Earl."  
  
This servant is truly excellent. I should give him a raise next time.  
  
  
＊＊＊＊＊  
  
  
As soon as I entered Miranda-san's general store, I heard her and a male
customer talking.  
  
They seem to be deep in conversation behind the counter. I'll wait while
looking at the merchandise until they finish.  
  
Thinking that, I looked around the store, which is always filled with
various items, and saw another person.  
  
"Chloe-san! Welcome!"  
"Klin-kun, are you feeling better?"  
"Yes, thanks to Chloe-san's medicine. Thank you!"  
  
Klin-kun was also in the store. He seems to have completely recovered,
and he flashed me a cheerful, boyish smile.  
  
"Chloe-chan, welcome~! You could have called out to me if you were
already here~!"  
"I'm sorry. It looked like you were busy..."  
  
Miranda-san noticed me and called out from across the counter. Looking
over there, the male customer turned around to look at me as well.  
  
"Oh, you're the young lady from the other day."  
"You're the one from the other day... it's been a while."  
  
Under a wide-brimmed hat was graying hair and a beard. The elderly man,
who gave off a calm impression, was the fisherman I met on the bridge
before.  
  
"Oh, I haven't seen you around lately. So you were with this young
lady?"  
  
He said, looking happily at the black cat on my shoulder. Come to think
of it, he had a slight connection to this black cat.  
  
"If Chloe-chan is here, does that mean the medicine is ready?"  
"Yes, here it is."  
"Oh, as expected~!"  
  
Seeing the mountain of medicine on the counter, Miranda-san clapped her
hands happily.  
  
"Yes, yes, the quality is not bad at all. In fact, it's excellent.
Should I raise the reward a bit?"  
"No, it's fine as it is."  
"Are you sure~?"  
  
Miranda-san looked at me as if confirming my intention.  
  
"Once the manager says something, she won't raise the price again."  
  
Klin-kun said, as if he couldn't bear to watch. Indeed, Miranda-san
appears to be absent-minded, but she's quite shrewd when it comes to
these things.  
  
"Instead... instead of raising the reward, please sell them at a lower
price."  
"Oh~, I've been beaten~!"  
  
Miranda-san puffed out her cheeks. If I kept the purchase cost down, a
small price reduction is fine. That would make the medicine more
accessible to those who need it.  
  
"Then it'll stay at 70,000G~. In return, I'll lower the selling price a
bit~."  
"Yes, please."  
  
《Quest Clear. Received reward from Miranda-san.》  
  
I received 70,000G as a reward. I'll use this to get a new weapon.  
  
"The medicine’s here. I'll go deliver it now."  
"But, are you sure you’re okay?"  
  
Klin-kun put several of the medicines, which were still on the counter,
into bags. Seeing that, Miranda-san spoke worriedly.  
  
"Are you going somewhere?"  
"Yes. It seems that a cold is spreading in the neighboring villages. So
I'm going to deliver this medicine to them."  
  
I see. The cold that was spreading in the town seems to be spreading
outside now.  
  
Apparently, shortly before I arrived, people from neighboring villages
had come to buy cold medicine. They left the money and asked them to
deliver the medicine when it arrived, then went back to their village.  
  
"But you see, Klin is still recovering. That's why I'm worried about
letting him go. And I can't leave Klin alone like that and go
myself……"  
"Then, should I go instead?"  
  
The fisherman spoke up.  
  
"I was just about to leave this town. I'll deliver it on my way."  
"Really? You won't run away with it?"  
"I won't, I won't."  
"Then I'll leave it to you~. What about the delivery fee?"  
"Then, could you give me another one of the treats I just bought?  
"Okay~!"  
  
It seems the deal is settled. If this man hadn't offered, I would have
gone.  
  
However, I didn't really want to leave the forest, so it's fine. In any
case, the fisherman mentioned he was leaving this town.  
  
"Are you leaving this town?"  
"That's right. I'm going to another place to find my next catch."  
  
Saying this, he made a fishing gesture. I guess he's going on another
journey to find a big fish.  
  
*'I hope you find a good catch.'*  
*'Thank you. I hope we meet again somewhere.'*  
  
Since I had the chance, I said goodbye in the Ente Kingdom’s language.
The fisherman smiled broadly before leaving the store with the
medicine.  
  
"I wonder where he’s going."  
  
I should have asked. Such words slipped out. He's a person from the same
region, so this farewell probably makes Chloe feel a little sad.  
  
"We were talking a while ago, and he seemed to be heading towards the
royal capital~. The ship to the royal capital, which has been irregular
lately, just happened to be arriving near the port town. If you miss
this chance, you don't know when the next one will come, so I advised
him to go quickly if he wanted to take it~."  
  
The port city is a city east of Dairode Town. I heard that because of
sea monsters and pirates, there were no ships coming. I've never been in
that direction before. I'd like to go there someday.  
  
"He'll probably be fishing from the ship."  
"Right. And he might catch a big one! No, maybe he'll catch another
greatsword~!"  
"Greatsword?"  
"Yes, a greatsword~. Apparently, he caught it while fishing on the West
Street Bridge. And, strangely, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't
pull it out of its sheath~."  
"Huh... He really couldn't pull it out? It wasn't because it was rusty
or anything?"  
  
...It feels like I've seen that somewhere before. Miranda-san happily
continued telling me the rest of the story.  
  
"Yes, that's what he said. At first, the old man thought it was because
it was rusty~. But when he gave it to a boy who passed by, he pulled it
out easily~!"  
"That's quite a strange story."  
  
It's more than just strange.  
  
I didn't know how Light-kun got that sword, but I thought it was
probably something he pulled out of a pedestal or something like that!  
  
No, wait. I can't say for sure yet.  
  
Maybe it was an ordinary sword and it just got stuck when he tried to
pull it out... that's possible too...  
  
"By the way, did you ask about the characteristics of the sword he
caught?"  
"Yes. He said it was a very beautiful greatsword~. The old man said it
was certainly valuable, but he had promised to give it to the boy if he
could pull it out, so he gave it to him. He said he regretted not
keeping it~."  
  
Of course, you would. Because what you fished out was the Hero's
Sword.  
  
*'I see. So that's how it ended up in his hands after that...'*  
  
I heard Lucille-san's surprised murmur. Afterwards?  
  
*'...What do you mean, after that?'*  
  
I used a private chat targeting Lucille-san because I was curious. It
seems that I can use private chat with some NPCs. Whether or not they
reply depends on the NPC, but Lucille-san is my familiar, so she can.  
  
*'Hmm. To solve the matter of the Red Beast, I was searching for the
hero. Therefore, I knew the whereabouts of the greatsword Rex, which was
once the hero's sword... but it was stolen once. So, its whereabouts
were unknown for a while. I knew he had obtained it, but I never thought
it would be like this. Kakaka.'*  
  
The greatsword caught by the fisherman went to Light-kun, whom he
acknowledged as a hero. Then, I defeated him and picked it up, and then
returned it to Light-kun.  
  
But now it’s been stolen by Tsubaki-san and is missing again. ...This
Hero's Sword has changed hands too many times.  
  
Was it Tsubaki-san who stole it first? But why was it sunk in the river
like that?  
  
"Oh, that's right~!"  
  
I heard Miranda-san's voice, as if she had remembered something. After
going to the back of the store, she came back to the counter.  
  
"That reminds me, talking about the ship earlier~. I bought this from a
traveling merchant who came on that ship~..."  
  
Miranda-san put something on the counter. It was made of a transparent
glass-like material. It glittered in the sunlight coming in from
outside.  
  
But the brilliance also gave off a sense of fear. Because the shape of
the object is like a skull. Not exactly the same, but slightly
deformed.  
  
"I hear that there is a country that loves art in the southern part of
this region. This was apparently made by an artist living there. It's
just a work of art without any effect... Do you want to buy it? By the
way, it's 100,000G, but... I'll let you have it for 50,000G since you’re
Chloe-chan~."  
  
Miranda-san held it with both hands and whispered. Just an ornament. It
doesn't have any particular effect. Besides, 50,000G. It's not cute,
it's scary.  
  
But this... I want it. It's a transparent skull! If I use it as a
crystal ball for fortune-telling, it would be very witch-like! ...Though
I can't do fortune-telling.  
  
And, it would be nice to have it as one of the interior decorations in
the house. ...though I'm not sure if it would fit in with my current
home.  
  
"By the way, this is a one-of-a-kind item. If it sells, there won't be
another one, you know?"  
  
Don't push me when I'm already struggling to decide! But if I end up
deciding not to buy it after thinking about it, I don't want to regret
it later on…  
  
"Ugh... I'll buy it."  
  
After a hard decision, I ended up buying it. I judged that it's better
to worry after I buy it than to worry now. Ah, the reward from earlier
is already gone.  
  
"Thank you very much~!"  
  
I saw Miranda-san's very happy smile. I'm sure there are other people
who would be lured in by this smile and end up buying it. What an easy
target.  
  
"Oh, Chloe-chan. I would be happy if you would continue to take on my
requests for medicine. Regularly bringing potions to my store would also
be great. Your quality is good, so the customers love them! Of course,
I'll buy them at a higher price than others!"  
"Is that true?"  
  
This is an unexpected offer. I was also looking for a regular income.  
  
"Of course! So let's work together from now on~!"  
"Yes, please."  
  
I’ll regularly supply potions to Miranda-san's store. Instead of making
them randomly and selling them as I have been, I’ll deliver the number
specified by Miranda-san. This time, she asked me to deliver 100 each of
recovery potions and magic potions, all 4☆ or higher.
