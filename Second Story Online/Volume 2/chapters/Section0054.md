# 54・Because I’m a Witch

Now that I've decided what to do, I'd like to act immediately, but
before that I need to check one more thing.  
It’s my acquired skills. My level has gone up, and I should've learned
more skills, but I haven’t had time to check them.  
  
There are no changes to my current skills, so I’ll just check the newly
acquirable skills… What’s this? More than twenty new skills have become
available all at once.  
  
“\[One-handed Staff\], \[Grimoire\], \[Crafting: Grimoire\], \[Crafting:
Accessories\], \[Presence Concealment\]…”  
  
Usually, acquiring skills is triggered by the player's actions. But I
don’t remember doing anything that would trigger any of these. Why is
this happening?  
  
*‘What troubles you?’*  
  
Lucille-san asked, as I sat at the table and deep in thought.  
  
How should I explain this? Saying that I’ve suddenly gained access to
many new skills would probably be understood. Even NPCs seem to
understand what skills are and how the system works.  
  
Actually, it seems the NPCs understand that they are NPCs in a game.
They interact with players as if they understand this.  
  
Though, when NPCs explain something, they don’t use simple, direct
words. The previous explanation about the Guardian is a good example.  
  
I could just say it as it is, but I'm a role-player. Since I'm playing
the role of someone living in this world, I want it to be believable.  
  
“Um… I feel like I can suddenly do a lot more things. I don’t remember
learning any of this…”  
*‘Ah, I see. That might be my fault. You see, we made a familiar
contract. Through that connection, some of my experience may have
transferred to you.’*  
  
So Lucille-san is the cause! All the skills I can now learn are skills
that Lucille-san knows.  
  
“Heeh~ Lucille-san, you can do so many things… wait, \[Witchcraft\]?!”  
  
I spotted it while looking through the skills list. It’s Witchcraft! I
have to learn this!  
  
*‘Ah, about that magic…’*  
  
《Acquired skill \[Witchcraft\]》  
  
“What? I already acquired it?”  
  
Normally, it costs 3 SP to acquire a skill, but this is a special skill,
requiring 5 SP.  
  
*‘…Chloe, are there any people who acquire skills without even hearing
the explanation?’*  
  
But it’s Witchcraft! Anyone calling themselves a witch should know it!  
  
“So, what is \[Witchcraft\]?”  
*‘\[Witchcraft\] is the magic that allows one to create strange magical
potions created by the fairy witch, Ruukte.’*  
“Magical potions? What exactly are they?"  
*‘Hmm… that’s right.’*  
  
Lucille-san hopped off the table and went towards a shelf of
chemicals.  
  
*‘There, the bottle with the blue liquid. That’s a potion made with
\[Witchcraft\].’*  
“This?”  
  
I picked up the bottle Lucille-san indicated. It contains a beautiful
blue liquid with sparkling powder inside.  
  
*‘Try drinking it. You'll know what it is immediately.’*  
  
So I drank it.  
  
“Cough… What is this taste!?”  
  
Contrary to its appearance, it wasn’t very tasty. It tastes like iron
and bitter herbs.  
  
*‘It’s a potion that surprises people with its awful taste! I think that
was Ruukte's idea.’*  
“Surprise… wait, what’s this light!?”  
  
Suddenly, my body was enveloped in light. It disappeared quickly.  
  
“What was that…?”  
*‘Oh my, you’ve become quite a bit cuter.’*  
  
I got a bad feeling from the black cat, who seemed to be smirking. I was
looking down at the black cat sitting on the table a moment ago… but why
are our eyes at the same level? Earl, who had been working nearby,
looked at me. Even Niru, who was sitting by the window in his usual
spot, woke up and is staring at me.  
  
“What's wrong? Earl… huh?”  
  
Did I just hear a child’s voice? Thinking that might be the case, I
inspected my body. I’m wearing the same clothes, but my body has shrunk.
I’m sitting in a chair, but my feet, which were on the ground before,
are no longer touching the ground.  
  
*‘Kakaka. This is a \[Child’s Potion\]. It’s a magical potion made with
the blood of a mysterious snake that can make your body smaller. It
turns the drinker into a child.’*  
“What did you make me drink!?”  
*‘Even your angry voice is cute.’*  
  
My voice lacks power, even though I'm angry… This is a terrible mistake.
All I did was drink the potion as Lucille-san suggested. She was wagging
her tail and laughing happily, as if her prank succeeded.  
  
“When will this wear off?”  
*‘Kakaka. It’s a potion for pranks. The effect will wear off in about
ten minutes.’*  
  
Good. I won’t stay like this forever. Apparently, this is a
prank-specialized potion devised by the mischievous fairy witch, Ruukte.
She can create potions with strange effects, ranging from useful to
utterly useless. What a potion she gave me to drink.  
  
Incidentally, the duration of these potions is short, often wearing off
very quickly. “This is just a prank potion. A long-lasting effect isn't
a prank, it’s a curse,” according to the fairy witch.  
  
Therefore, it’s not categorized with status ailments like paralysis or
poison, but displayed as a transformation icon. That’s why \[Dark
Compensation\] didn’t activate. That's a bit disappointing. No, even if
it had been a target status for \[Dark Compensation\], I probably
wouldn't use it.  
  
Well, despite the unexpected turn of events, let me check my skills
again. I acquired a lot of new skills at once. Among them, the ones that
seem useful are…  
  
\[Spatial Magic\] Acquisition SP: 4  
This is a skill that appeared alongside lightning magic as a branch of
wind magic. It seems to contain few offensive spells and mostly support
spells. I already have enough offensive magic, so I’d like to acquire
some support magic.  
  
\[Forest's Blessing\] Acquisition SP: 3  
A skill that appeared in the acquirable skill list as a result of my
actions. I’ve been active in the forest a lot. Since I’m often in this
forest as the Guardian, this skill should be useful. The effect is to
increase my status when I’m in the forest.  
  
\[Herbivore\] Acquisition SP: 3  
…I know why this appeared in the list. It’s more like, why didn't it
appear until now? The effect is that eating plants increases satiety and
enhances the effects of those plants. Eating herbs directly will fill me
up and recover my health like a potion. Since potions have a recharge
time, this can be used as a substitute.  
  
I’ll get those. Including the \[Witchcraft\] skill, I’ve used 15 SP. I
have 13 SP left.  
  
That’s enough skill checking for now. Time for a break. I’m still in my
child form. I have to wait a few more minutes.  
  
All of a sudden, Earl, who had been working on something, seems to have
finished. He was putting away the tools he was using.  
  
“What were you doing, Earl?”  
  
When I approached, Earl, who is usually big, looked even bigger. The
brim of my hat was obstructing my view, so I took it off to look up at
him. His face is farther away than usual, and there are more shadows on
it, which is a bit scary.  
  
Noticing this, Earl crouched down to meet my gaze. Then, he showed me a
thick, wooden ornament he was holding.  
  
I didn’t know what to do so I tiled my head and Earl pointed towards the
window. There, Niru is sleeping in the sunny spot. He looks slightly
unhappy. He's restlessly shifting his position. He looks a little
different from usual. You see, Niru usually sits on someone's shoulder
or something, so it’s rare to see him on a flat surface.  
  
“Ah, I see…”  
  
Nodding at my words, Earl went to the window where Niru was. He placed
the wooden ornament next to him. Niru immediately opened his eyes and
noticed the ornament, then jumped up and landed on it.  
  
“So you were making a perch for Niru.”  
  
Niru started sleeping happily on the perch, and Earl was smiling
contentedly. Earl is truly a kind orc.  
  
*‘Earl is an odd one.’*  
“Oh really?”  
*‘Meaning, as an orc. Orcs are a race of moderately intelligent, but
violent and ferocious monsters. That one’s actions are not like that.
Quiet, bad at combat… that is completely unlike an orc, a disgrace to
the orc race.’*  
  
It’s true that Earl is bad at combat and cowardly. But he's kind-hearted
and dexterous, and he made a perch for Niru. He may be a disgrace to the
orc race. …Huh? If he's a disgrace to the orc race, how did the other
orcs see him?  
  
When I contracted him as my servant, he seemed to have nowhere else to
go. I now understand how the other orcs treated Earl, and the reason why
he refused a reward. For him, the reward had already been given: a place
to belong.  
  
Now then, knowing this, what should I do?  
  
“Earl. Thank you for Niru's perch. Don’t push yourself. I’ll be grateful
for anything you can do, so please continue to help me.”  
  
He smiled happily and patted my head in thanks. Don’t treat me like a
child…Oh, right, I am a child!
