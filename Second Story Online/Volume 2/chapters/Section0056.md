# 56・Request for Cold Medicine

Next, we went to the general store. As usual, it's the one ran by
Miranda-san.  
  
“It’s closed…”  
  
A sign that probably said “Closed” was hanging on the pink door. I
failed to decipher the Swaro Kingdom language and couldn't read the
characters…. However, this is unusual. It's rare for it to be closed in
the middle of the day (in-game time). I always imagined this shop being
open. That's probably because even if the owner isn't there, her
employee, Klin-kun, usually is.  
  
“Ah, Chloe-chan”  
  
Just as I was about to leave, the pink door swung open. The shop owner,
Miranda-san, came out.  
  
“Hello, Miranda-san. Are you going out somewhere?”  
  
Her attire is different from usual. She usually wears an apron dress,
but now she's in clothes and trousers that look easy to move in. Her
fluffy hair is also neatly tied up so it doesn't get in the way. It
looked like she was about to go somewhere.  
  
“Ah~ Chloe-chan, what perfect timing~! I have a small favor to ask.”  
“A favor?”  
  
Miranda-san looks a little paler than usual. I should ask her about
it.  
  
“Klin, you see, he’s caught a cold…. But I’m in trouble because we don't
have any cold medicine. Chloe-chan, you can make medicine, right?”  
“Cold medicine…”  
  
Cold medicine… how do I make that? I've made potions before, but never
cold medicine. I have the Alchemy skill, so I think I can make it, but I
don't know the recipe. I never thought I'd find out that I can't make
cold medicine at a time like this.  
  
“Chloe-chan… can you not make it?”  
  
It’s painful to see Miranda-san look at me with teary eyes. Please wait,
I'm sure it's written on the walkthrough page...  
  
*‘What are you hesitating for? You should be able to make it.’*  
  
As if she couldn't stand it any longer, I heard such a voice from
Lucille-san. The black cat that came to my feet was tapping my brand-new
shoes I just bought, as if to tell me to hurry up and make it.  
  
“No, well, I don't know the recipe for cold medicine… I'm trying to
remember it right now.”  
  
It's not in my brain, so I've just opened the strategy guide. Please
wait while I search (remember).  
  
*‘…What? You don’t know?’*  
  
Lucille-san shook her head wearily. Apparently, there hasn't been a
demand for cold medicine before. It seems that everything can be easily
cured with healing magic, but I can't use that. That's the job of
healers, priests, and monks. I need to use medicine instead.  
  
*‘Cold medicine is made with medicinal herbs, red grass, and white
herb.’*  
  
Lucille-san said the same thing as the search results.… What a superb
cat-shaped search engine I have here. Just kidding.  
  
*‘Look, you have the materials, right? You can do it with your skill, so
hurry up and make it!’*  
“I understand!”  
  
I don’t know if she read the joke in my mind, but she kept tapping my
leg to hurry me up. Please stop. Miranda-san is looking at me strangely
because I've been talking to a cat for a while now.  
  
I borrowed the counter of Miranda-san’s shop and started mixing. I put
the intermediate alchemy kit and materials on the table. The process
seems to be the same as for potions. Grind the necessary ingredients and
simmer them in a pot. I used Miranda-san's shop's well water, so the
taste should be fine...  
  
I tried tasting it. It's still bitter. Hmm… it seems the taste of cold
medicine isn’t easy to get right.  
  
“Oh!”  
  
Miranda-san came back after checking on Klin-kun.  
The contents of the pot I was simmering were shimmering and changing
color. Miranda-san peered into the pot, perhaps fascinated by it.  
  
“By the way, Miranda-san, you were about to head out somewhere. Is
everything alright?”  
“Ah~ It's fine. I was going to see the pharmacist who used to supply me
with medicine. I haven't seen her lately though…”  
“I see.”  
  
So that’s why it was perfect timing. Then, Miranda-san sighed.  
  
“Where did she go… that Grandma Lucille?”  
“Don’t worry, she’s healthy enough to deceive an innocent young girl.”  
  
I said that with a smile to ease her worries. I'm sure it's just my
imagination that Earl was looking at his hands as if he wanted to say
something. But it's true.  
  
Or should I have just said Lucille-san is that black cat? Indeed, my
true nature may have shown a little bit.  
  
“I don't really get it, but I’m glad Grandma is doing fine!”  
  
Miranda-san smiled, so I’ll call it a success. And the cold medicine is
finished. It's a liquid medicine in a bottle shaped differently from a
potion. It’s a translucent green color, somewhat similar to a recovery
potion.  
  
“Klin! Chloe-chan made some cold medicine for you!”  
  
Miranda-san happily went into the room at the back of the shop.
Following her, we arrived at a small room with basic furniture. Klin-kun
was sleeping in bed with a towel on his forehead. He noticed us coming
in and slowly sat up.  
  
“Ah, thank you.”  
  
His eyelids were drooping, probably because of the fever. Even so, he
thanked me and received the cold medicine from Miranda-san. But he
didn't drink it immediately.  
  
“Klin, what's wrong? If it's hard to drink, should I hold the bottle for
you?”  
“I can drink it myself. I don't need any help…”  
  
Klin-kun looks quite young. Perhaps that's why he doesn't want to be
treated like a child.  
  
“…I just don't like bitter things.”  
  
He hesitated to drink it because he dislikes the bitterness of the
medicine. …Maybe he’s exactly as he seems.  
  
  
After putting Klin-kun to sleep, we returned to the shop. Lucille-san
said he should get better soon.  
  
“Thank you for the cold medicine!”  
“You’re welcome. Please tell me if you have any more problems.”  
“Yes, thank you so much! By the way, weren't you here for something
else?”  
  
That’s right. I almost forgot the purpose of my visit. I came to buy
some things I'll need soon.  
  
“Do you have any fertilizer? And a broom…”  
  
I told Miranda-san what I needed. I have something I want to try with
the fertilizer. The broom is for cleaning, not for flying. Since my
weapons got delayed, I have a little more budget, so it's fine.  
  
“By the way, do you also sell clothes here?”  
  
I glanced at Earl. Earl is staring intently at the goods displayed on
the shelves. Covering his large body is a black robe and a full set of
starting equipment.  
  
“Clothes for that onii-san, huh~? Just a moment~”  
  
Miranda-san retreated into the back room again.  
  
“Earl, is there anything you’re interested in?”  
  
Earl was looking at a sewing kit. I think I remember that you can use it
to make cushions and cloth armor. There are beginner and intermediate
levels.  
  
“If you want it, you should buy it. You have money, don't you?”  
  
As if reminded, Earl took some money out of his shoulder bag. This would
be a good opportunity to let Earl make his first purchase.  
  
Earl was standing in front of the shelves, money in hand, struggling. I
didn't want to bother him, so I stepped away. Miranda-san hasn’t come
back yet, so I’ll look around at the goods.  
  
There was one interesting item among the products. It’s something called
a \[Request Form\]. As its name suggests, if you use a \[Request Form\]
to request something from someone, it will be treated as a system
quest.  
  
Players can also create their own quests and make requests of others.
Isn't that interesting? Well, I don't think I'll have a chance to use it
at the moment.  
  
"Sorry to keep you waiting!"  
  
Miranda-san came back, so I resumed shopping. The clothes she brought
was a set of traveler's equipment. Apparently, this is the equipment to
get after the starting equipment. Indeed, I've seen clothes very similar
to these quite often.  
  
It's inexpensive, but the performance is pretty good, which is why it's
popular with new players. The ease of movement and comfort ideal for
harsh journeys means it can also be worn as casual wear, according to
the description.  
  
“It’s not bad.”  
  
I thought the blue clothes would clash with the green skin of an orc,
but it wasn’t that bad. Moreover, the brown hooded cloak is less
suspicious than the previous black one. The appearance blends into the
town better than before and he just looks like a large traveler passing
by.  
  
“The total is 3000G. I’ll give you the clothes as a bonus for the cold
medicine~”  
“How about you waive the whole thing?”  
“That’s a bit much~”  
  
She smiled kindly. As expected of Miranda-san, she’s a true merchant.  
After I finished shopping, Earl came up. He put the goods he was holding
on the counter. He seems ready to buy them.  
  
He’s buying beginner and intermediate sewing kits, as well as cloth and
thread.  
  
“Are you buying this too?”  
  
And then woodworking tools… also beginner and intermediate levels. Earl
looked at me as if to check if he made a mistake.  
  
“No. Since it’s your purchase, I won’t say anything.”  
  
Come to think of it, he crafted Niru's perch. He made it skillfully even
without any equipment, but he could certainly make something better with
the right tools.  
  
“Thank you~. You’re the first Orc customer I’ve had~!”  
  
Oh, Miranda-san found out about Earl. Well, anyone would notice if they
were that close…. Even though she found out, she said she wouldn't tell
anyone.  
  
“Because you’re an important customer~. Come back anytime~”  
  
She gave Earl a gentle, fluffy smile. Apparently all customers are
welcome, whether they’re monsters or humans.  
  
“Oh, that's right. Chloe-chan, there’s one more thing I would like to
ask you.”  
“What is it?”  
“About the cold medicine… would you be willing to make about 100 more?
I’ll buy them for 70,000G!”  
  
《Quest: Request for Cold Medicine Production: Deliver 100 cold
medicines.》  
  
Miranda-san begged with clasped hands. At the same time, a quest
appeared.  
  
Apparently, a cold has been spreading around town recently. Most of the
residents treat their colds with medicine, so cold medicine sells well.
That's why there wasn't any cold medicine for Klin-kun.  
  
“Understood.”  
“Thank you, Chloe-chan! You can deliver them anytime. Oh, but I’d like
them before the next cold outbreak.”  
  
Miranda-san smiled happily when I accepted the quest. …Come to think of
it, is Miranda-san a player? I don't know, since she hasn't acted
suspiciously yet.  
  
Well, it doesn't matter. Miranda-san is still a good shop owner.
Besides, the other person might think I'm an NPC.
