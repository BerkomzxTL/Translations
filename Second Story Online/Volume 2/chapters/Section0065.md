# 65・Crimson Apostles of Chaos

"Is this really the place, Aniki?”  
“Yeah, it should be. After all, this is where those guys were
talking…”  
  
Hurrying towards the entrance, we found the two people from the video.
They were wearing the same blood-red hoods as the man from the previous
incident. Their matching robes bore the insignia of some kind of
religion; there was no mistaking it.  
  
“But, there’s nothing here? Were we tricked?”  
“Then that guy was lying? But my gut feeling tells me he wasn’t. I still
think we’re in the right place.”  
“Hmmm… but Aniki, don’t you think it’s dangerous to act without
permission?”  
“It’s alright. Leave it to me.”  
  
The two were whispering something to each other. The taller one, who
spoke confidently, was called “Aniki” (Big Bro) by the shorter one, who
seemed to be subservient.  
  
*‘What is it with that mismatched duo...?’*  
*‘It doesn’t seem to be him… but judging by their clothing, they seem to
be his accomplices.’*  
  
I thought that man had returned, but apparently not. Now then… what
should I do? If they’re that guy’s accomplices, they’re probably no
good. Ignoring them isn’t an option, so I’ll try talking to them
first.  
  
“What are you doing here?”  
"Whaaat?!"  
  
I approached them gently, trying not to seem threatening. They must not
have expected to find anyone this far out in the forest. They were very
surprised.  
  
“Oh, it’s just a person. Don’t scare us like that.”  
“My apologies. So, what are you doing deep in this forest? Are you
lost?”  
“No, it’s nothing. Leave us alone.”  
“Yeah~ neither Aniki nor I are suspicious people~”  
  
I'm talking to them because they seem really suspicious... Well, they
are suspicious, but they haven’t done anything yet. Though they seem
about to.  
  
Hmm… let’s try probing them.  
  
“I see. I have another question, if you don’t mind. Are those robes
fashionable? I had a terrible experience recently with someone dressed
similarly to you both.”  
“Oh, that’s unfortunate. Sorry, but do you know who it was... or do you
live around here?"  
“Yes. I live in a nearby town.”  
“Hmm.”  
  
The taller man looked at me thoughtfully. I lied about living in a
nearby town, but maybe he saw through it?  
  
“Hair as black as the darkness of night, and eyes like deep green
emeralds…”  
“My, you’re quite the charmer.”  
“No, those aren’t my words. That’s what that person said…”  
  
…Who’s “that person” you keep mentioning? I have a feeling I know… Did
he really say something so embarrassing? He does seem like the type to
say something like that casually.  
  
"And a witch with a pointy hat... It’s just as he said.”  
"Eh, is that the person?"  
“Yeah, definitely.”  
  
The taller man smirked with a predatory glint in his eyes. I responded
while being slightly on guard.  
  
“…What do you mean by that?”  
“You said you met someone dressed like us earlier, right? Wasn’t he a
rather childish person who laughed a lot?”  
“…Are you guys his accomplices?”  
“Well, anyone can see that from our clothes.”  
  
So, they’re part of the same organization as the man who came before.
So, was it really him who said those words?  
  
“Who are you? What are you trying to do with that power of Chaos?”  
“Naturally, to bring destruction and Chaos to the world. That’s our goal
as the \[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\].”  
  
The \[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\]. Is that the organization of the man
who turned Lucille-san into a red beast and tried to destroy the sealing
magic circle?  
  
“Now then, you seem to know something about what lies ahead.
Unfortunately, our companions didn’t tell us…”  
“Aniki~ are you really going to do this?”  
“Of course! If we outsmart her here, it’ll be my… no, our
achievement!”  
“But… what will we do if this gets found out…?”  
  
The shorter, higher-pitched one seems to be timid as well. He’s
desperately trying to stop the taller man.  
  
“So what? Our organization doesn’t have a clear leader. Everyone is free
to act as they please. Have you forgotten that?”  
“But… still, it’s dangerous~”  
“Yeah, well. That’s why we wear these hoods, right? If we don't have
faces, no one will know it's us even if we get caught, right?"  
“Right, that makes sense!”  
  
Even with hoods, their mismatched heights make them easy to identify.
Though you can't claim any achievements if you hide your identity.  
  
“Right, let’s see… Hey, tell me what's up ahead? You know something,
right?”  
“Unfortunately, I don’t know the way ahead, nor what’s there. I’d rather
be the one asking you.”  
“Really?”  
“Really. And even if I did know something, do you think I would tell
people like you?”  
"That certainly seems to be the case..."  
  
I smiled. I can’t easily reveal that I’m the Guardian.  
  
Still, it seems like these guys don’t even know what lies ahead. They
seem to have come here simply because that man was here… That man seemed
to know, but I guess the information wasn’t shared within the
organization.  
  
Even if the information isn't shared, it's on video, so they could find
out if they wanted to... but that's only true for players. If you’re a
role-player, it’s a different story... it's not necessarily true that
the character you're controlling knows what you know. If that's a
priority, then they’ll ignore the videos.  
  
Though there are role-players who don't care about that, like me.  
  
I'm a bit of a mixed bag. I use information from walkthrough pages and
things.  
  
That said… information about the sealing magic circle should be
important to this organization. To monopolize it… is it because he
doesn’t want the credit stolen?  
  
“If you don’t have any information, we’re done here. See ya.”  
“Oh, where are you going? Do you think I’d just let people like you
go?”  
“You should just let us go. It's two against one, sweetheart.”  
“Besides, we haven't done anything yet~”  
  
That's certainly true, but that doesn't mean I can just ignore it.  
  
“As his comrades, I can't let you go. And I still haven't gotten the
information I want… could you please tell me where that man is?”  
  
I pointed my staff at them. I hope it looks cool. I won't let this
valuable source of information slip away.  
  
“There’s no way we’d tell you… Ugh. We were about to let you go… oh
well. If you insist, we’ll get that information by force.”  
“It’s too late to cry now! You’ll pay for not accepting Aniki’s
kindness!”  
  
With that, they both drew their weapons.  
  
The battle has begun. There are two of them. Judging by their weapons,
the taller man has a short sword, and the shorter one has gauntlets.
Both will probably engage in close combat.  
  
As a magic user, I mainly use ranged attacks. I need to defeat them
without letting them get close, while casting spells. For now, I can't
win if we're two against one, so I'll split them up.  
  
*‘Chloe, don’t let your guard down.’*  
*‘Yes, of course.’*  
*‘I’ll leave the commanding to you. Tell me if you need support.’*  
  
Lucille-san, hidden nearby, answered. I gave Niru instructions and had
him wait in the sky.  
  
I deflected the taller man’s throwing knife with \[Wind Shield\] and
began chanting a spell. I cast \[Sand Spear\]. I simultaneously cast a
summoning spell with double cast.  
  
“Appear, my loyal servant!”  
  
I successfully summoned an \[Earth Golem\]. A large, reassuring back
appeared before me.  
  
“Aniki, leave the golem to me!”  
“Right!”  
  
The shorter one seems to be dealing with the golem. The taller man
slipped past him and approached me. I fired off the \[Sand Spear\] I’d
been chanting, but he avoided it with his speed, so it didn’t hit
properly.  
  
"Cowardly..."  
  
While cursing, I immediately started casting \[Shadow Arrow\].  
  
Still, they seem like mere underlings, but they’re strong. No, they
really are strong. Niru can’t identify their information, so I can’t see
their HP bars. The \[Rebellion\] effect is activated, clearly showing
that they're higher level.  
  
This is happening while I’m getting backup from my status as the
\[Guardian of the Seal\]. Are you guys really just underlings?  
  
I used \[Shadow Move\] to evade the approaching short sword. I can hear
the taller man click his tongue as his attack misses. But \[Shadow
Move\] has a five-meter radius. If they’re quick, they’ll catch up right
away.  
  
"You're the one who’s a coward!"  
  
I haven’t finished chanting \[Shadow Arrow\] yet. Five seconds is a long
time. I cast \[Wind Cutter\] at the approaching opponent, but… it was
parried. Checking the log, the skill \[Parry\] was used. Can you parry
magic?  
  
Another attack came. But \[Shadow Move\] is on cooldown, and I can’t
move from here while chanting. Two seconds left until \[Shadow Arrow\]
is complete. I don’t mind taking the hit if it buys me two more seconds…
but if I take consecutive hits, I’ll be near death, and if the chant is
interrupted, it’s game over.  
  
So I escaped upwards. I deployed \[Earth Shield\] at my feet. As the
raised earthen wall lifted me up, my field of vision expanded.  
  
“Clever trick!”  
  
The taller man, using the momentum of his run, kicked off the earth wall
and climbed up. For a moment I could see under the hood… instead of a
human face, there's a furry beast's face. He seems to be a beastman.
That explains his high physical abilities.  
  
No, I don’t have time to think about that. The taller man's blade is
closing in on me! But I’ve finished chanting \[Shadow Arrow\].  
  
I couldn't avoid his attack at this distance, but he couldn’t avoid mine
either, so I was able to buy some time. A large red damage effect
scattered, but the HP bar still remained.  
  
Now it’s my turn to counterattack… wait, my staff is gone?!  
  
“Disarmed…?!”  
  
The skill \[Disarm\]. As the name suggests, it forcibly disarms you. My
staff was removed and sent to my inventory.  
  
I thought I could take the damage, but I can't do anything without a
weapon. I also had to stop casting spells because I didn't have a
staff.  
  
“Well, how do you feel now? Ready to talk?”  
“I feel absolutely awful, but I’m not going to.”  
  
I can’t take another hit. I managed to avoid the enemy's attack by
breaking down the earth wall that he was using as a foothold.  
  
I could equip my staff… but even then, I have no countermeasures. Magic
takes time to cast.  
  
On the other hand, he has a short sword. Among close-range weapons, it
should have a fast skill activation speed. Its attack power isn’t high,
but that’s irrelevant against someone with low health, especially
someone like me.  
  
So, I won’t equip my staff and take the fall damage… no.  
  
I won’t equip my staff, but instead, my broom. I quickly equipped the
broom and activated the flight skill, creating distance from the
enemy.  
  
“Flying is cowardly! Get down here!”  
“You wouldn’t even let me use my weapon. Who’s the coward here?”  
  
That ghost from before and now this… I really hate opponents who won’t
let me cast magic. They're my nemesis.  
  
Now, what to do… I’m dodging throwing knives while flying. I’m still not
used to controlling the broom, so it’s wobbly, but the unstable flight
seems to be helping me dodge knives.  
  
Nearby, my summoned golem is fighting the shorter man. Ah, the golem is
about to lose. If this turns into a two-on-one fight, I’ll lose…  
  
“Don’t look away!”  
  
The man, who was just below, climbed up a tree. As expected of a
beastman, his physical abilities are high.  
  
Beastmen who are closer to beasts are said to be able to exert their
strength more easily. Since his face is covered in fur, he’s probably
one of the more physically capable beastmen.  
  
“You’re really mobile despite the state of your body.”  
  
It’s true that my HP bar is about 40% gone. Without the status boosts
from \[Rebellion\], \[Forest’s Blessing\], and \[Forest Guardian\], that
one hit would have killed me.  
  
In fact, even with all those boosts, this is the result. He probably has
some kind of attack-boosting effect too, so this state is probably the
result of them canceling each other out…  
  
…No, that’s wrong. He doesn’t mean that. Oh, no.  
  
Yes, of course. My HP bar is down by 40%. That means Chloe has been
seriously injured.  
  
Yet, she’s showing no sign of pain! I didn’t role-play the injury!  
  
My pain sensitivity setting is normal, so I don’t feel much pain. That’s
why I forgot. That’s an unforgivable mistake for a role-player…  
  
"Ugh... I had managed to forget, but because you mentioned it, I've been
reminded of the pain!"  
  
As a desperate measure, I’ll say that and belatedly apply some injured
role-play. I have no memory of ever consciously acting with an injury in
mind… Is this alright? I’m a little unsure, so I’ll practice it for next
time.  
  
I role-played the injury while recovering HP with a potion. Since I’m
flying, my MP is decreasing. Even if my MP runs out, I can use
Lucille-san’s MP with her \[Mana Supply\] skill. So I won’t fall, but
I’ll also recover MP with a potion.  
  
*‘Chloe, don’t overexert yourself. Sometimes, it’s important to
retreat.’*  
*‘Yes, I understand. But I don’t like retreating much.’*  
  
Besides, this time, we were the aggressors. I’ll think about retreating
if things get truly dangerous.  
  
I looked up and saw Niru circling, watching me. It’s alright, please
stay there, I’ve just come up with a good idea.  
  
This is a combination of skills I haven’t used before, so I don’t know
if it’ll work, but let’s try it.  
  
—I’ll use \[Spatial Magic\].  
  
*‘Lucille-san, please create an illusion for the shorter one.’*  
*‘Right, understood.’*  
  
I gave Lucille-san instructions and started casting two spells while
flying in the air. It seems that magic skills can be used as long as you
have something equipped, regardless of weapon category.  
  
Plus, since I’m flying, I can move even while chanting. Amazing. But
since I have a weaponless broom equipped, the power won’t be that
great.  
  
“Watch out for the hidden familiar!”  
  
It seems they’ve noticed. He chased me through the trees and called out
to his partner.  
  
But this is fine. The first thing I need to do is create a momentary
gap.  
  
“Alright!”  
  
The shorter man, distracted by Lucille-san, momentarily stopped
attacking the golem. I used that moment to get closer to him. I’m now
within the skill’s effective range.  
  
“Now, let me return the favor, you rude people! \[Dark Bind\]!”  
  
Both enemies are caught in the range of \[Dark Bind\]. They were bound
by chains of darkness.  
  
“\[Exchange\]!”  
  
The next spell I cast is \[Exchange\], a type of \[Spatial Magic\], one
of my initial spells. The cast time is five seconds, the same as \[Dark
Bind\]. The effect is to swap the positions of selected targets.  
  
“What?!”  
  
The golem in front of the shorter man disappeared in a flash of magical
light. In its place, Niru appeared, flapping his white wings and shaking
his long, beautiful tufts.  
  
Niru cast \[Dark Mist\] on the shorter man. After that, he used
\[Feint\], a skill he recently learned, to attract his attention.  
  
Now, where did the golem that swapped places with Niru go?  
  
“Seriously…”  
  
I looked behind me to see the answer. The taller man looked up,
muttering in a trembling voice. Above the man, bound and unable to move,
the golem that went to the sky in exchange for Niru was falling.  
  
The taller man and the tree branch were crushed, and he fell to the
ground along with the golem. All that was left was a mountain of earth
as the golem returned to soil.  
  
The damage is a golem-sized lump of earth falling from that height, plus
the impact damage from hitting the ground. Even if he survived, he’s
buried under that pile of earth. It will be extremely difficult to
escape.  
  
“An… Aniki!”  
  
The shorter man shouted towards his buried comrade. At that moment, his
gaze momentarily turned to the right… from his perspective, information
about party HP should have been displayed on the left.  
  
Are they players? Well, even if they are, that doesn’t change what I'm
about to do.  
  
The restraints were released, but the shorter man is still staggering
around due to Lucille-san's reapplied illusion. I quickly switched to my
staff and began casting.  
  
“If you tell me about that man right now, I’ll let you go. What will you
do?”  
“…I can’t do that. If I say anything, I’ll be roasted alive.”  
“That’s unfortunate. Then, take this message… when we meet again, I
won’t show mercy.”  
  
With that said, I cast the fully charged \[Dark Burst\]. Thanks to
various effects, the high-power magic was doubled and blew the shorter
man away. His HP was probably blown away too.
