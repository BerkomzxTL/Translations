# 55・New Clothes

Ten minutes passed, and my body returned to its normal size. Finally, I
can go out. It would have been quite inconvenient for Chloe to go out in
that childlike state.  
  
"Come on, Earl, let's go shopping."  
  
I've been thinking I should get some new equipment. I just received my
reward, or rather, income, from Lucille-san. Besides, it's necessary for
getting stronger.  
  
It's probably a good idea to buy Earl some clothes too. Right now, Earl
is still in his starting equipment. Earl doesn't really understand how
to spend money, so it'll be a learning experience for him.  
  
Along with Niru, Lucille-san, and Earl, of course, we all arrived at
Dairode town. This town, with fewer players than before, is lacking the
initial crowds and bustle, but it has a peaceful, rural atmosphere that
I like.  
  
"Um… hello?"  
  
The bell chimed as I opened the door and entered the shop. This armor
shop… well, the shopkeeper here is someone Chloe doesn't like.  
  
"What, you again?"  
  
A reply came. I was surprised. I thought they wouldn't greet me like
last time. No, more than that, I was told "again?".  
  
"Was I not supposed to come?"  
"No."  
  
The perpetually unfriendly shopkeeper simply said that and fell silent.
Since Chloe doesn't like him either, it's fine if that conversation
doesn't continue. Anyway, I came to look for new armor. Let's look for a
long, witch-like skirt.  
  
I do like my current miniskirt witch outfit, but you know, a short skirt
is no good. For various reasons.  
Incidentally, I'm the only customer in the shop right now. Lucille-san
and the others are waiting outside.  
  
"Do not have…"  
  
I looked through all the items in the shop, but couldn't find anything
good. That's because most of what's here is for beginners.  
  
"Hey."  
"Hii!"  
  
Someone called out to me from behind again. Please don't call out to me
from behind. It's startling. Turning around, I saw the large shopkeeper
looking down at me. This has happened before, hasn't it?  
  
"This isn't a place for someone like you."  
  
What…? So I wasn't supposed to come after all? Maybe this shopkeeper
dislikes Chloe too.  
  
"Did I do something to offend you…?"  
"No."  
  
The shopkeeper scratched his head in a troubled manner. It seems I'm not
disliked.  
  
"You're not a beginner, are you?"  
"Well, I'm not exactly a beginner… Is this shop maybe specialized for
beginners and newcomers?"  
"It’s not a specialty shop. Not a specialty shop, but… the customers are
usually beginners."  
  
This is a starting town, so the customers are naturally people who just
started the game. It makes sense that the items stocked are all for
beginners.  
  
Ah, that's why the shopkeeper said this wasn't the right place for me.
When I came here before, I was part of this shop's target customer base.
But now I'm outside that range. I understand why he said in the
beginning, "Why did you come again?"  
  
"Wait a minute."  
  
Saying that, the shopkeeper went into the back of the shop. Then he came
back with several pieces of clothing.  
  
"These might suit you. We don't have anything better than this in
stock."  
  
The shopkeeper arranged the clothes he had brought onto the counter. The
equipment on display is all beginner-level, but these, brought from the
back, are probably the right level for me.  
  
"Thank you."  
  
I thanked him and looked at the clothes. Some of them are beyond my
current level, so let's choose something I can equip within my budget.  
  
"Then I'll take this set."  
  
The set I chose is a deep green robe. It's a robe with a long skirt
reaching my feet, and wide sleeves. There's a short poncho-like cape and
shoes to match.  
  
Among the items, it was good in terms of both looks and performance. And
more than anything, it comes with a matching pointed hat. It has a cute
yellow ribbon. This is the only choice, isn't it?  
  
"That one, huh?"  
  
The shopkeeper probably knew I'd choose that. His expression is still
unfriendly.  
  
At the shopkeeper's suggestion, I tried it on. Instead of a black gothic
lolita witch, there is a slightly mysterious green witch standing there.
Deep green isn't bad. It matches Chloe's green eyes. The yellow accent
color isn't bad either. But…  
  
"Black would be better."  
"Black would be…"  
  
It doesn't feel quite right, this color. I was thinking how nice it
would be in black. It has its own atmosphere and I like it, but it's
more of a subdued witch look.  
  
"We can do custom orders, but… it'll take time. What would you like to
do?"  
"I'll take this one for now. We can do the custom order next time."  
  
A custom order is tempting, but I'll pass for now. This set cost around
50,000G. It's a considerable expense, but it can't be helped. I might
not be able to buy a weapon now.  
  
"What will you do with your old equipment? I can buy it back, but…"  
"No, I won't sell it. I like the design of that outfit."  
  
I'd hate to part with it. Its performance will be inferior now, so I
probably won't wear it much, but still.  
  
"Right. Okay then."  
  
The shopkeeper said that gruffly and returned to his seat behind the
counter.  
…I feel like he looked a little embarrassed.  
  
Now, leaving the armor shop behind, I went to the weapon shop.  
  
I was worried about money, but I've run into a bigger problem. It seems
there's no equipment that suits me. Like the armor shop, they only have
beginner items here.  
  
"I'd like to make something for you, but… I can't make anything at the
level you need. The necessary material, magic ore, hasn't arrived from
the Iru Mines yet. You see, the red beast prevented merchants from
passing through the forest until recently."  
  
The shopkeeper told me that. I didn't realize the red beast problem had
such a wide-ranging impact… I think the Iru Mines are located beyond the
Twilight Forest. It's true, it can't be helped.  
  
So, getting a new weapon will have to wait. Well, my current supply is
low anyway, so it's fine. At least I got my current staff repaired.
