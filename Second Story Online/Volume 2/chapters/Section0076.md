# 76・What We Found Was a Red Shadow

"Now then... what should we do with you?"  
  
We've moved locations; this is the guard post. We've borrowed a cell,
claiming that we've caught Lily-chan, the perpetrator of the assault
cases. It's the perfect place for an interrogation.  
  
"I have several questions for you. First… is it true that you kidnapped
Klin-kun?"  
  
Beyond the iron bars was Lily-chan, bound and sitting on the stone
floor. Even while being brought here, her small mouth remained firmly
shut. Even now, she maintains a sullen expression, her lips sealed, and
she was just glaring at us.  
  
"Hey, please. Anything is fine... Can you just answer me? Do you know
anything about Klin?"  
  
Miranda-san asked in a trembling voice, but Lily-chan's demeanor didn’t
change. ...Although Miranda-san has been unyielding until now, is it
just my imagination that she's suddenly become quite weak when it comes
to Klin-kun? Ah, that's not something I need to think about now.  
  
"Say something instead of staying silent!"  
  
Seeing this, Light-kun raised his voice and questioned Lily-chan, but
instead of replying, Lily-chan just turned away  
  
"This…!!"  
"Stop it."  
  
As Light-kun, losing his patience, tried to open the iron gate and
enter, Kyle-san stopped him.  
  
"She won't answer if we ask normally. ...Why don't you leave this to
me?"  
"...Then I'll leave it to you."  
  
Kyle-san looked confident, opened the iron gate, and went inside. For a
moment, I caught a glimpse of his profile, and it looked rather
sinister. Ah… I have a bad feeling about this.  
  
"You have nowhere to run now, will you not be honest with us?"  
  
Kyle-san spoke relatively calmly as he gradually approached Lily-chan.
He stopped in front of her, looking down at her as she looked away.  
  
"...Do you know? Apparently, the law doesn't apply to demons. You're
different from us humans…"  
  
After saying this in a low voice, he suddenly kicked the wall. The spot
was right next to Lily-chan's face, where she was looking away. A heavy
sound echoed as the soles of his boot hit the stone wall.  
  
"Fortunately, there's only us here. Even if I did something to you, it
wouldn't leak out…"  
  
Kyle-san says this calmly… his smile is certainly not a kind one. Ah… it
reminds me of that Kyle-san from way back….  
  
"Y-you humans threatening Lily…? That's meaningless!"  
  
Although she says this, tears were welling up in Lily-chan's eyes,
threatening to spill. ...Wait, now that I think about it, isn't this
situation dangerous? It's Lily-chan, a seemingly young girl with teary
eyes, and Kyle-san, whose face is terrifyingly scary… this is bad in so
many ways.  
  
"That's enough. Kyle-san, aren't you going a bit too far?"  
"Don't be fooled by appearances. There's a possibility that even those
tears are a lie—"  
“It's excessive... isn't it?”  
"...Ah."  
  
As if realizing his mistake, Kyle-san's face turned pale. Ignoring him,
I turned back to Lily-chan.  
  
"Whether you're a demon or not, I need your testimony. Can you be honest
with me?"  
"...Even if I told the truth, you wouldn't believe me, would you?"  
"It depends on the contents. Whether we believe it to be a lie or the
truth is up to us. And let me just say one thing. There is the suspicion
that you kidnapped Klin-kun, but I don't think you did."  
"...Heeh~ And why is that?"  
  
Lily-chan's eyes changed as she looked at me. The tears earlier were
apparently a lie, her eyes now calm but wary as she watched me.  
  
"I need solid evidence to make me think that. So, I'll ask— Do you
remember a boy with light brown hair?"  
"I don't know anything about that—…no, I might remember."  
"When and where?"  
"Maybe the other night… When I went to crush those who were obstructing
Lily, that time. I think they were carrying someone… He didn't seem to
be one of their comrades, and his features were definitely that of a
young human boy with brown hair."  
  
It seems Lily-chan didn't kidnap Klin-kun. But someone else did…  
  
"Wait a minute! You said you didn't know anything about Klin, right? Why
are you saying this now…"  
"Did you ever tell Lily-chan anything about Klin-kun's appearance
besides his name?"  
"Ah... maybe not..."  
  
Up until now, Lily-chan’s only been asked about Klin-kun's name. Even if
she had seen him, there's no way she would be able to answer about
someone she doesn't even know the name of.  
  
"Even if I only knew his name, Lily said from the start that she didn't
kidnap anyone!"  
"That is true. She did answer that when we first asked. However, at the
time, I thought she might be lying…"  
  
Lily-chan puffed out her cheeks and pouted. I think it was unavoidable
at the time.  
  
"Wait… you're going to believe this demon's words? What about what I
saw?!"  
  
Poco-chan intervened with an incredulous expression.  
  
"What?! I'm only telling the truth! Besides, who are you?!"  
  
…Please wait. I can’t ignore what you just said.  
  
"Lily-chan, do you not remember her? You were the one who injured her,
weren't you?"  
"I don't recognize her."  
"You liar! You were the one who gave me these injuries!"  
"I don't remember you. Besides, there's no way I'd forget such a
conspicuous beastkin, right?"  
  
She certainly has a point. Poco-chan has a distinctive appearance, so
you won't mistake her for anything or forget her.  
  
"You liar! You liar! You attacked me! And I saw you kidnapped
Klin-kun!"  
  
Poco-chan doesn't believe Lily-chan. It could be because she's a demon,
but Poco-chan also seems confident that Lily-chan kidnapped Klin-kun.  
  
"...It may have been a misunderstanding. Poco-chan, you said you hit
your head and your memory is hazy. Perhaps you mistook someone else
kidnapping Klin-kun for Lily-chan?"  
"...U-ugh, that's true, my memory from that time is hazy… that's a
possibility, but…"  
  
Poco-chan put her hand on her bandaged head. She still doesn't seem
convinced.  
  
"Then, is there a reason for Lily to kidnap him?"  
"She's a demon, so she's probably plotting something wicked and
kidnapped him for that purpose, isn't she?"  
"It's true that she might have been plotting something and kidnapped
Klin-kun for it… but that plot was probably disrupted by someone else.
Isn't that right?"  
"That's right, Onee-san. Lily had a purpose for being in this town… but
those guys interfered with her plan! So, in retaliation, she's been
going around crushing those she thinks are their accomplices to find the
ones who ruined her plan!"  
  
Lily-chan answered while looking a little embarrassed.  
  
"What if that's a lie too?"  
"That wouldn't be the case. Remember how she looked right before we
caught her? The anger she showed towards whoever was interfering with
her… do you think that was an act?"  
  
She was very angry at that time. Even before we arrived.  
From the looks of it, the anger is probably genuine.  
  
"Then, who are those guys? Who kidnapped Klin-kun? Who else could it be
besides her?"  
"I have a pretty good idea… Lily-chan, let me ask you something else."  
"What is it?"  
"The ones who interfered with you and kidnapped Klin-kun— was it people
in red hoods?"  
"I know exactly what you mean. Yes, those stuffy, annoying guys in those
ridiculous hoods!"  
  
Ah, so it is. It seems those guys were behind these incidents.  
  
"Then, they also caused the Chaos among the townspeople?"  
"Chaos…? Ah! The red mist! So that's it… It was definitely them. They
scattered the red mist, and everyone who inhaled it had red eyes. I was
fine, though."  
  
Was Lily-chan unaffected by the mist because she's a demon? I'm curious,
but let's leave it for later.  
  
"Those guys in red hoods are scattering the red mist indiscriminately on
the townspeople. It ruined my plans…"  
"Heeh, I see."  
  
The actions of the red-hooded group have had unexpected effects. Neither
is something to be welcomed, but…  
  
"Anyway, it seems Lily-chan is telling the truth, so I can't say her
testimony is unreliable. Also, it's possible that the red-hooded group
attacked you."  
"...That seems to be the case. Chloe-san, it seems my memory was wrong,
just as you said."  
  
Poco-chan seemed convinced and backed down. …I thought it would take
longer to convince her, but it was surprisingly easy.  
  
"...I understand most of it, but… even if those red-hooded guys
kidnapped Klin, why did they kidnap him? And why did they scatter that
red mist at random?"  
"They must have had some reason…"  
  
Light-kun's question is valid. They must have a purpose, and the red
mist and Klin-kun are somehow related to it… but what is it?  
  
If it was about destroying the seal like before, it would be easy to
understand… but it feels different this time. The red mist certainly has
the power of Chaos, but it's weak. It's a power that can be negated by a
potion with the power of holy water, or even without holy water, it's so
weak that it can be nullified. It doesn't affect Lily-chan…  
  
"By the way… was there red mist when Klin-kun was kidnapped?"  
"Yes, there was. In fact, Lily-chan is using the red mist to track them
down."  
"Was Klin-kun affected by the Chaos at that time?"  
"I don't remember that far…"  
  
She doesn't remember that much, of course…. If a potion with the power
of holy water can negate the effect of the red mist, it seems like an
amulet could protect against it. I'm thinking maybe that's why he was
targeted…  
  
"Ugh, we won't figure it out by thinking so hard! Let's go find those
guys quickly. We don't know if Klin is safe while he's being held by
those guys!"  
"That's true…!"  
  
Light-kun said this and ran towards the exit. Miranda-san followed after
him. Light-kun's right, there's no time to think here. We should find
Klin-kun as soon as possible.  
  
To that end—  
  
*'So, how long are you going to sulk, Kyle-san?'*  
*'Ah, sorry…'*  
  
Kyle-san finally seems to have calmed down and looked up.  
  
*'I'm sorry about acting out earlier. However, considering the "Kyle"
persona, that kind of role-play didn't feel right…'*  
*'No, thank you for stopping me. I guess I was getting a bit carried
away. …The only interrogations I've ever done are threats or torture… or
being on the receiving end.'*  
*'…Is that so?'*  
  
What does that even mean?! Kyle-san, who are you…? Ah, I'm curious, but
I feel like I shouldn't ask. I’m hesitant to ask.  
  
"Wait! What are you going to do with Lily!"  
"I'll leave you in the custody of the guards. Goodbye."  
"Wait! Don't leave me here!"  
  
We left Lily-chan in the cell and left the place.  
  
  
After leaving the cell and arriving at the entrance, there was a crowd
gathering.  
  
"You're that damn bratty hero from before!"  
"You're that shiny-gold guy who didn't listen to what I said the other
day!"  
  
The angry voices that rose simultaneously started to give me a headache.
Oh no. This is bad.  
  
Looking at the crowd, there's Light-kun, and facing him is a man.  
A large man wearing shiny gold armor. And around him are people with
similar gold-based equipment.  
  
That time… the gold-clad group who clashed with us over the red beast
incident and were ultimately blown away by me are here.
