# 94・Phantom City (3)

"Actually, could you stop that? It's damaging the organization's
image!"  
"Come now, honey. You know we're a newly established organization, so
we're short-staffed, right? We have to promote our organization here, or
people will just go to the Demon Clan~!"  
  
Ignis and Poco-chan were having this exchange right in front of me.
Don't they realize my image of their organization is crumbling with
every passing second? This isn't a cult, it's a comedy troupe.  
  
"Ignis, you're here?"  
"What are you two doing...?"  
  
Then Oswald and that tall underling appeared. ...As expected, Oswald is
a player, because he was green. So, the tall guy...?  
  
"Are you the only NPC...?"  
"Black Witch-san, what's an 'NPC'?"  
  
The tall underling tilted his head, clearly confused. The circle
indicating him was blue.  
  
"Ah~! Aniki doesn't need to know about that! Come on, Aniki, let's go do
some recruiting!"  
"Hey, Poco! Don't drag me!"  
  
The tall guy was dragged away by Poco-chan.  
  
"...Chloe, you'll forget this, right?"  
"Yes, Chloe will forget. But I will remember."  
  
I smiled sweetly. Given the setting of this city, Chloe will forget. But
that scene will never be erased from my memory.  
  
"My flawless image..."  
"Your image is not something that can be destroyed so easily by
something like this. You're too demanding of perfection, aren't you?"  
  
Oswald encouraged Ignis, who was feeling a little down. ...Was their
relationship like this in the game? Their way of speaking is the same,
but both of them feel very much like themselves, rather than their
characters.  
  
"My pride won't allow it. I've been working hard for the past month."  
"A month? What do you mean?"  
"Ah, well, I've been gathering the necessary information to play the
villain. Not only information my character knows, but all sorts of
information about this world, from the first release. I've been reading
books and asking people. During that time, I haven't appeared on the
main stage even once. I didn't want a half-hearted role."  
"I see, so that's why you had so much information, and you were able to
coordinate with NPC Lucille-san."  
"Yeah, fitting in with Lucille-san’s story was tough... I didn't expect
her to know me.... But it was all worth it. I did a little bit last time
too, but this time I finally showed my face and proudly played the
villain, so I'm really happy... What am I even saying?!"  
  
Ignis suddenly looked startled and covered his face with his hands.  
  
"This kind of talk... doesn't suit me..."  
"Your character is a naturally gifted, cocky guy. These lines really
don't suit you."  
  
That regretful expression wouldn't suit the character "Ignis,"
either...  
  
"Hey, let's pretend we didn't hear that..."  
"I won't."  
"Right..."  
  
His usual composed smile was gone, replaced with a strained one. He's
really so different from his in-game self.  
  
"Excuse me... are you Ignis-sama?"  
  
Just then, women in red hoods approached Ignis. ...Ignis-sama?  
  
"Hey, can I help you with anything?"  
  
…His strained smile instantly changed back to that childish grin. His
mask-changing is remarkably fast.  
  
"Um, we'd like to get your autograph and a photo with you!"  
"Of course. It's a request from a fellow member, after all."  
  
When he said that, the fan excitedly squealed. You’re quite popular as
an idol...  
  
"Wait, Ignis. ...That autograph and photo together cost 100 star
coins."  
  
Oswald said this to the female fan.  
  
"...You're charging money?"  
"Of course. After all, I was the one who created the initial elements
that shaped the current “Ignis”, from the character model to the
appearance and initial settings! He's worth charging for. Of course I'll
charge!"  
  
Oswald crossed his arms and boasted... No, it’s Oz-san. He's no longer
the in-game character "Oswald." But even so, it was Oz-san who created
the character "Ignis" himself...  
  
"I see, so there was a handsome villain route..."  
"...What are you saying, Kyle-san?"  
  
I wonder what he reacted to. Kyle-san muttered that after watching Ignis
take a picture with the woman. Even if he's handsome, it wouldn't look
good if you did it, but maybe it's just me...  
  
"Isn't 100 star coins a bit too much?"  
"That's the lowest price. And it's still better than that."  
  
Ignis, having finished dealing with the fan, pointed in a certain
direction. Looking over there—  
  
"Hi everyone! My underlings~ How are you all doing? It's Lily! Well,
actually... it’s your eternal little girl. I'm MM, the virtual idol!"  
"Yayyyyy MM-chan!!"  
"Please shake my hand!!!"  
"Oh my, everyone's so impatient. Okay, we’ll be having a handshake event
in an hour! Tickets are on sale for 500 star coins~"  
  
...Surrounded by many male fans was none other than Lily-chan the
demon.  
  
"...What is that?"  
"MM, the virtual idol. She's the most famous and longest-running idol in
the idol world."  
  
...I've heard her name before. No, I might have seen her on a TV show
recently. Lily-chan was that famous?  
  
"Incidentally, she's the third generation."  
"Third generation...?"  
"She's a virtual idol. Her appearance doesn't age. But...well, it's a
different person inside."  
"...I see."  
  
Her appearance is probably a 3D avatar. That's why she doesn't age...
But the person playing her has changed.  
  
"...So villains have to do idol activities?"  
"No, Chloe. There's no such rule. Besides, maybe our characters will
gain some fans too, you know?"  
  
Kyle-san said that. What? That means Chloe might get fans too?  
  
"What should I do... I've never signed anything."  
"Don't get ahead of yourself... We don't even know if we'll get any
fans."  
  
That's true, but what if it happens? I should practice my autograph...
shouldn't I?  
  
"Oh my, if it’s not onee-san... And that group of amateurs who just
showed up out of nowhere."  
  
Lily-chan, noticing us, came over. Her eyes were unpleasant towards the
red-hooded people, including Ignis, who was standing next to her.  
  
"You really did it this time. It was supposed to be Lily and the Demon
Clan who were going to turn that town into a scene of carnage..."  
"You were creating a gate to the Demon Realm, weren't you? Our
underlings seemed to have destroyed it... Well, it was only a side
effect, but it was fun to ruin your goals, Demon Clan."  
"Ugh...that rabbit was annoying, but you're pretty annoying too!
Intimidating humans is Lily’s job! Next time we meet, I'll crush you
completely! You upstarts!"  
  
This incident... if things had been a little different, we might have
been fighting Lily-chan and the rest of the Demon Clan...  
  
"But you keep saying 'upstarts'... what do you mean?"  
"Ah, our \[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\] is an organization that doesn't
exist in the official history."  
"What...? What does that mean?"  
  
Doesn't exist in the official history? Despite having such a presence,
even NPC Lucille-san knew about it?  
  
“―There once was an organization called the Liberator sect, which sang
of the liberation of the Star Gods, broke away from the Star Church, and
brought Chaos to the world with the Chaos Dragon. Among them were
radical members who stained their pure white robes with blood... The
origins of the Crimson Apostles of Chaos would be those radicals. Well,
it's an original organization I created."  
  
The one who said this was a man in a red hood with black wings on his
back. His face is hidden by the hood and a black blindfold with a symbol
of an eye on it, so his face is covered.  
  
"Nice to meet you all. I am the founder of the \[Crimson Apostles of
Chaos\]. In the game, I'm just a mob character, so I don't have a
character name I can give you... I'm wearing a blindfold to make it
easier to identify me... But before that, this character is dead, so
even if I introduce myself..."  
"What? You died?"  
"Yes, I died. I was defeated by a hero the other day... and never
returned..."  
  
...The founder who suddenly appeared is already dead... What exactly is
this \[Crimson Apostles of Chaos\] all about...?  
  
"Well, please call me Phantom for now."  
  
The man who called himself Phantom bowed to everyone present. The other
red-hooded members, including Ignis, seemed surprised by the sudden
appearance of the founder.  
  
"Is what you said just now true? That you created this
organization..."  
"Yes, yes, of course. I role-played with that setting from the start of
the first period, based on my knowledge from the beta. Then, people
started using this organization's name after me... I wonder if that's
why... Before I knew it, it seemed to have been incorporated into the
official setting... and now it's become an organization that even NPCs
know about."  
  
After further questioning, it turns out that the "Liberator sect"
organization was part of the official background. The story about the
radicals and so on was something he added.  
  
"I see the look of incomprehension on your faces. But that is the nature
of this game. The words you weave become history in this world (game).
That is the charm of this world. Come now, performers. Speak your false
truths! Those words (lies) shall become the stories (truths) that color
the blank pages prepared by the Gods! Hohoho, Huhahahaha!"  
  
Phantom spread his arms wide and shouted so loudly that it could be
heard by everyone around.  
  
The truths of lies...? We role-players sometimes feel like what we are
doing is meaningless. It's understandable if we're called play-actors.
Even more so in other games.  
  
He seemed to be saying that it’s meaningful.  
  
No...but even so...  
  
"...I now understand that you villains are actually all weirdos."  
"Don't lump me in with those guys! I'm doing my job seriously!"  
  
As for what's behind Ignis...  
  
"If you're going to play a villain, join our organization~ Hey, Aniki,
help with recruiting!"  
  
"Uh...In the game, if you want to relieve daily stress, \[Crimson
Apostles of Chaos\] is recommended. Role-playing is easy... but hey,
there are a lot of characters I don't understand..."  
  
"Wait a minute! The Demon Clan is also short-staffed! It's better to
play a villain in our Demon Clan with a long-running history, rather
than joining an organization that just popped up like this!"  
  
"What? You want to take a picture with me? Heh, to be captivated by this
appearance, you’ve got some good taste. Here’s 50 star coins."  
  
"Now, act out your lies! You are the actors who make this fabricated
world the truth!"  
  
Including Lily-chan, aren't all the villains a comedy troupe?  
  
"Well then, please do your best, Ignis-san..."  
"Stop... stop it. Don't look at me like that..."  
  
When I looked at him with a pitying gaze similar to Niru’s, he began
muttering with his shoulders trembling.  
  
"Villains are despised, hated, and loathed, and in the end, they are
told they deserve it, and they die in an ugly and cruel way. Don't...
don't look at me... don't look at my Ignis with that pitying gaze!"  
  
Ignis-san has completely fallen apart. Well, he was so earnestly playing
the villain, but with his surroundings like this, it was bound to
happen. Moreover, he seems to be a very proud person. Given that he
strives for perfection, it seems he demanded the same from those around
him.  
  
The Ignis in the game gave the impression of being the one manipulating
the other characters... but in reality Ignis-san is being manipulated by
those around him.  
  
"Yes, stop. Please don't bully my brother so much, Chloe-san."  
  
It was Oz-san, who had been taking pictures just a moment ago, who
covered and held down Ignis-san's mouth after he said that and
collapsed. …So they’re brothers.  
  
Well, I was found out, huh. No, I know you're supposed to avoid bringing
up the circumstances of in-game characters, but... still, you can't
forgive the unforgivable, right? So I just got a little revenge, that's
all.  
  
"Ugh...why would you do something like that to belittle my character?
You're the one who created that character to begin with!"  
"I wasn't belittling you. I just think that being too perfect is no
good. What's the point of aiming for perfection? It leads to a lack of
humanity, like an NPC. Are you planning to become a machine?"  
  
That might be true. The only ones who can perfectly role-play in this
world are NPCs. Because they are just machines that do things
perfectly.  
  
"It's a bit troubling to have such a perfect little brother... Well,
he's still a little brother I can be proud of. If only he wasn't taller
than me..."  
"So that's why I’m this awkwardly short! That's why I’m shorter than
your character!"  
"Hahaha, you only just noticed? My dear little brother."  
  
The tall Oz-san placed his hand on Ignis-san's head, as if suppressing
him. In reality, their height difference would be reversed.  
  
"...Being a villain is hard."  
"Yeah, that's true. It's tough being a villain..."  
"Why do you agree so much, Kyle-san?"  
"...Ah, it’s nothing."  
  
Kyle-san had been nodding in agreement a moment ago, but when he heard
that, he looked away.  
  
"I was wondering, why doesn't Kyle-san play a villainous character?
You'd be perfect for it..."  
"I just wanted to play a righteous character. Look, this whole story is
just—"  
"That's something Lily was curious about too..."  
  
Before I knew it, Lily-chan had come over. And looked at Kyle-san with a
puzzled expression as well.  
  
"Oh, right. Hey, Lily, there's something I wanted to ask you..."  
"What's what?"  
"You're a virtual idol, MM, right? I heard you're streaming the game."  
"Yeah, I am. But I edit the recorded footage."  
" ...The footage from Berry Village."  
"It's been edited and uploaded on the internet."  
"I knew it!"  
  
Kyle-san held his head. ...Come to think of it, we didn't upload the
footage of Berry Village to the history because of Kyle-san's poor
performance. But Lily-chan's recording seems to have been uploaded.  
  
"Sorry, I just thought that was your character. I didn't think it wasn't
in the history... but, but, I think what you did this time will be added
to the history."  
"Ah, that's it. That's the problem..."  
  
This time too, Kyle-san made a mistake in his role-playing. Because it
was such a large-scale epic quest, even if Kyle-san alone refused, what
happened this time will likely be recorded in the history.  
  
"Hey, about that... I have a suggestion, won't you listen, onii-san?"  
"...What is it?"  
"Well..."  
  
Kyle-san bent down to match Lily-chan's height, and Lily-chan began
whispering in his ear. There was no need to do that; it would have been
inaudible to others using private chat...  
  
Well, it was probably a conditioned reflex, thinking of it as a private
conversation. They're both role-players after all.  
  
"...So, what do you think?"  
"No."  
"It's a really good setup! And a delicious setting too, isn’t it?"  
"No way. I don't want to play a villain! I have enough of that at
work!"  
  
It seems Kyle-san rejected Lily-chan's suggestion outright. But I heard
something interesting.  
  
"Hey, Kyle-san. What do you mean by 'work'?"  
"Ah... it's nothing."  
"...I see. Excuse me. But considering your past actions, I think
Kyle-san does quite dangerous work, so it's something you don't want to
talk about..."  
"Wait! What are you misunderstanding?! My job isn't dangerous!"  
  
Kyle-san seems very troubled, but he muttered that there was nothing he
could do.  
  
"...Ha. I'm an actor who shows my face. And I specialize in villain
roles."  
  
...I never imagined he was a professional actor. But it all makes sense
now. Was his role-play ability also due to him being an actor?  
  
"The role-playing mistakes were just me falling into old habits from
years of playing villains."  
  
Tsubaki-san slipped into her role-playing habits earlier... and Kyle-san
is the same. His case is different because of the years of experience,
so it’s almost ingrained in him.  
  
"I see... I thought you were involved in some shady business..."  
"Well, that’s not entirely wrong. I play those kinds of roles, after
all."  
  
Since he said he shows his face, Kyle-san's real face must suit those
kinds of roles. In this day and age, some actors use avatars, but
Kyle-san is different, it seems.  
  
"I've been playing those kinds of roles for so long... that's why I
longed to play a protagonist or a role that wasn't a villain... Playing
'Kyle' is... because of the image my agency has, it's a role I could
never play in real life."  
"So 'Kyle' is someone you admire, then?"  
"Yes, that's right."  
  
Kyle-san spoke with a little embarrassment... Like me and Tsubaki-san,
he seems to have started this game to play the character he aspired to
be.  
  
"Seriously? Old man Kyle is an actor?!"  
"What works have you appeared in?! I'm really curious!"  
"Ugh, that's why I didn't want to say it!"  
  
Kyle-san was being pressed by Light-kun and Tsubaki-san. The reason he
was avoiding the topic of who he was is because he didn't want to be
asked.  
  
"Oh dear, I got rejected. Well, it can't be helped... By the way,
Hero-kun over there?"  
"W-what is it?"  
  
Light-kun was startled by Lily-chan suddenly addressing him.  
  
"I just wanted to ask... were you really chosen as a hero?"  
"Huh? Of course I was! Well, my sword was stolen..."  
"No, I'm asking if the church officially recognized you as a hero."  
"Eh... no, I've never interacted with anyone from the church?"  
"Ah, I thought so."  
  
Lily-chan looked a little troubled. Was there some kind of problem?  
  
"You see, the title of hero is given to those who have been recognized
by the church as having a star. Just because you have a star doesn't
mean you can call yourself a hero."  
"Eh...? Seriously?"  
"Well, not necessarily."  
  
It was Oz-san who came out and said that.  
  
"The term 'Hero' originally referred to the heroes of the stars. The
church spread that usage. Now, as it's generally said, it's appropriate
to call those recognized by the church heroes... but there are also
those who call star bearers heroes, so it's not always the case."  
  
His words were convincing. As you can see from his clothes, Oz-san is a
former priest from the Star Church. So he probably had the opportunity
to learn about such settings.  
  
"Hmm, so that's the setting. I haven't had much exposure to the human
world so I didn't know much about it. Sorry, Hero-kun. I gave you some
vague information."  
"If you have any questions related to the church, ask away. I'll tell
you what I can."  
"O-okay..."  
  
Light-kun replied hesitantly. Well, I guess that's what happens when
you're treated like this by people who were enemies until just
yesterday...  
  
"Even so, it's amazing how many of you know the settings..."  
"Well, Lily has been gathering information for about a month now. She
only really started acting seriously after that Berry Village incident,
you see?"  
  
Lily-chan was also in hiding like Ignis-san... The dedication of the
first generation to role-playing is amazing. I had heard that only those
who are passionate about role-playing stuck around, but it's more than I
imagined.  
  
"I guess it’s because I was originally a beta tester, too."  
"Really?"  
"Yeah... Oh, right, did you know that the five heroes over there are
based on events that happened during the beta test? The elf witch over
there is modeled after a character I used during the beta test."  
"Eh, is that true?!"  
  
No way... To think that Oz-san in front of me was the heroic witch
Astrea...  
  
"It's just a model. The name and character model are completely
different from the character I used. However, the event of the five
heroes fighting the demon lord actually happened."  
"So that's how it was..."  
"All the data from the beta period was cleared. I thought there would be
nothing left, but... I guess the management is pretty cool."  
  
He looked at the bronze statue of the witch with a sentimental
expression.  
  
"I started this game because I admired the witch in the commercial. If
you hadn't played that character, I might not have picked it up."  
"Is that so? I never imagined my character would inspire someone to play
the game... it's truly a reward for a player."  
  
Oz-san laughed happily... I never thought I'd have such a connection
with him.  
  
"So―be careful, Hero-kun?"  
"That's right, you don't want your hero powers taken away, do you?"  
"Y-y-y-yes, I understand!"  
"Hey, hey, don't scare him so much."  
  
I heard some alarming words and Light-kun's flustered voice. Then,
Kyle-san was calming him down. Looking in that direction, I could see
Lily-chan and Ignis as well.  
  
"What’s the matter?"  
"What is it… I'm just sending a cheer to that special onii-chan, who
possesses the power of a hero, from the villain's side, you see?"  
"And this is just a warning. Among the players who already have special
positions like hero or demon lord, players who have engaged in harmful
behavior have had their rights and powers revoked, or in severe cases,
their accounts have been suspended. So, we're just telling him not to do
that."  
  
...So that’s what was happening. It seems the status you can gain is not
permanent. The developers can suddenly take away that power.  
  
"It wouldn't be surprising if this power were taken away from me at any
time too."  
  
Saying that, Ignis showed his ring. ...Indeed, your power is special.  
  
"You'd better be careful too, okay? Players with special status are
monitored more strictly by the developers than other players. If you
cause trouble for other players..."  
"Bang! You'll be done in, you know?"  
"...I'll keep that in mind."  
  
Being told that by these two villains, all you can do is nod.  
  
"You too, Hero-kun?"  
"That’s right, if onii-chan doesn't do it properly, that right will be
transferred to someone else."  
"I understand... Yes..."  
  
He was being pressured by the two villains. ...Despite being taller than
the two of them, Light-kun looked small.  
  
"...Huh. Even though I've become a hero and have a special
position...it's completely different from what I imagined..."  
"Well, do your best, Light-kun. You were chosen, after all."  
"Yeah, that's right... My usual self is too ordinary and boring. But...
in this world, I'm a hero. I've become special!"  
"...Light-kun?"  
"...Ah, yes. I understand. I'll be careful..."  
  
Whatever the two of them told him, Light-kun has become quite meek.  
  
"Oh, it's almost time for the handshake session! Bye~!"  
  
And with that, Lily-chan disappeared into the crowd.  
  
"Humans! You guys need to help us out already. Make use of that ordinary
handsome face of yours and get some girls!"  
"Ordinary handsome face..."  
"Kukuku, fuhahaha! It's true, it's an ordinary handsome face. Thank
you!"  
"Oz, I don't think that was meant as a compliment..."  
  
And so Ignis and the others were taken away by Poco-chan.  
  
Ordinary handsome face... Ah, that's certainly a fitting description. In
a game world with free character creation. Naturally, most people will
create characters with good looks. Looking around, there are only
handsome men and beautiful women. ...Well, excluding demons and
monsters.  
  
But still...  
  
"Nobody is asking me for an autograph. Don't you think that's
strange?"  
"No, it's not strange at all."  
  
I received a cold response from Kyle-san. But it really is strange.  
  
"Because I did quite well this time, didn't I? And what happened last
time... I was selling potions in the forest. I should have at least some
recognition... some..."  
"No way. The world isn't that easy."  
  
Ugh... Maybe it's because it's coming from an actual actor, but those
words are just too convincing.  
  
"...I'm just an ordinary pretty girl. Just a convenient potion
seller..."  
"How much did you want an autograph...? Ha, fine..."  
  
Kyle-san extended his hand.  
  
"Can you sign it for me?"  
"What is it, Kyle-san? Were you actually a Chloe fan?"  
"...No way."  
  
I understand that it was out of sympathy. But he said he'll give me one.
...In that case, I'll write one. Yes, I'll write it in beautiful
handwriting!  
  
I took out an electronic colored paper and wrote my signature on it.  
  
"Is this alright?"  
"Yeah yeah, thanks."  
  
Kyle-san stared at the card for a while. What's wrong? Were you moved by
how beautiful my handwriting is?  
  
"Hey, Chloe..."  
"What is it?"  
"Is this... what you call katakana in Japanese?"  
  
...I messed up. I really did write 'クロエ' (Chloe) in katakana, didn't
I!?  
Ah, English would have suited Chloe better... Why did I write it in
Japanese?  
  
"Um, Kyle-san. Please give that back. I'll rewrite it..."  
"...No. Mistakes like this are more valuable."  
"Wh-what?! 'Kyle'-san would have given it back!"  
"That's right. But I'm not 'Kyle’ right now."  
  
The one laughing is neither the polite Kyle-san nor the villainous
Kyle-san, but just a mean old man.  
  
"Here, I'll give you my autograph."  
"Wait! I don't need this!"  
"That's harsh. It's my autograph, so be grateful and accept it!"  
  
I reflexively accepted the colored paper he tossed over. In that moment,
Kyle-san took the opportunity to disappear somewhere.  
  
"Seriously..."  
  
Looking at the card Kyle-san gave me... it's a neat and beautiful
signature. He is an actor, after all, so he's used to writing
autographs.  
  
...Wait a minute. It's an actor's autograph, right? Can I sell it at an
auction?  
  
No, I can't do that. Besides, he kindly wrote my name on it, and it’s
under the name ‘Kyle’. In the first place, I don't know who the actor is
or where he's from.  
  
Well, since he gave me his autograph, I'll take it. I carefully saved it
in the storage of my VR device.  
  
"Fufu, you seem to be having fun."  
"Ah, I'm sorry. I've been ignoring you..."  
"No, it's alright. It was fun watching you two interact."  
  
My friend came over and said that.  
  
"Everyone seems to be having so much fun playing this game."  
"...Yes."  
  
The plaza is filled with all sorts of people. ...Among them, there are
probably players who, like me, started playing the game because they had
people they admired.  
  
"The players seem to be having fun... but They also seem to be having
fun."  
  
Following her gaze, there were NPCs happily talking to players.  
  
"After they were retrieved, I was unable to find out their whereabouts.
...I was very worried that they might have been silently discarded, but
seeing them so healthy... I'm truly relieved."  
  
She seems to be a little teary-eyed as if she had confirmed the safety
of an old friend.  
  
Old-model support robots were collected by Noah Corporation due to a
certain flaw. They were made too perfectly human... They were made to be
so perfectly human that they even perfectly replicated the flaws of
humans…  
  
Things like making mistakes at work, slacking off... You can see it in
Niru. He does his job properly, but basically doesn't want to work. If
you ask me if a machine would do that, I don't think it would.  
  
So the old model that was used... may have been perfect as a person, but
as a machine it was a defective support robot.  
  
"...Even if they had been discarded, I think they wouldn't have minded.
After all, they are... just AI. They are mindless machines."  
"Maybe so. The fact that I feel good on their behalf... is probably
because I'm human."  
  
She said so.  
  
"...But I think this is the best place for them to work."  
"Yes, it is... there's no other place like it."  
  
Since they are human-like AI, they can easily handle living among the
inhabitants. That was their biggest drawback, but now that drawback is
an advantage.  
  
“……I hope you win the lottery.”  
“Yes, I hope so too!”  
  
The girl, turning around, smiled as if hoping it would come true.
