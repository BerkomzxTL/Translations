# 84・The Town Stained in Crimson Chaos

*‘...I'm sorry, I also let an enemy escape.’*  
  
I reported the situation to Azi-chan and the others in party chat while
checking their current location on the map. They're near the \[Star
Stele\] in this town. Since the marker is moving, it seems they're
heading towards me.  
  
...Earl is also in that location. Earl is my servant, so even if we're
not in a party, I can check his status at any time...but it seems Earl
was also defeated. Earl was originally a monster, but now that he's my
servant, he can receive the blessing of the \[Star Stele\], and like
players, he can "revive" from the stele.  
  
So, even if he receives a fatal injury, it's okay...but I don't know
what would happen if he were in a place where there's no stele or if
it's like Lucille-san's situation. Well, I guess a player would be in
the same situation.  
  
The death (loss) conditions for players and NPCs aren't quite clear. Has
anyone investigated this in detail?  
  
Well, right now, it's more important to decide what to do next. The gate
key has been stolen.  
  
*‘What do we do? Should we meet up first?’*  
*‘Just letting you know, we can't track the key on our own. There are
too many enemies.’*  
*‘About how many were there?’*  
  
Honestly, I've only seen three people from that organization so far.
Were there really that many?  
  
*‘A lot! Enough to make the area turn red!’*  
*‘About thirty, I'd say.’*  
*‘Thirty...? That many?’*  
*‘I'm not lying, it's the truth...but seeing the current state of this
town, you'll believe it, whether you like it or not.’*  
*‘What do you mean...?’*  
  
"Aaaaaahhh――!!"  
"Stop! Why are you attacking?!—"  
  
At that moment, I heard screams and shouts from somewhere. The commotion
was coming from the main street, and people ran into this narrow alley
as if escaping.  
  
Going against the flow of people, I went out to the main street...  
  
"Red mist!?"  
  
The entire main street was engulfed in a red mist. Residents, their
minds affected by the mist, were rampaging in a state of Chaos.  
  
"Fuhahahaha! Cry, scream, fear! We are...the \[Crimson Apostles of
Chaos\]! In the name of the 'Great Chaos,' we are beings that will bring
destruction and Chaos to this world!"  
  
There was a group of hooded figures wearing robes even redder than the
red mist. ...Their numbers, even just counting the ones I can see,
exceeds twenty. ...It's a surprisingly large organization.  
  
They attacked not only the residents rampaging in Chaos, but also the
fleeing people. They also destroyed surrounding buildings. I got the
impression that they were just going wild and destroying everything they
could get their hands on. ...I see, so it's a group made up of people
like him.  
  
*'We've also spotted those red-hooded guys here as well...where did all
these people come from!'*  
*'It's true! There are some on this street too...there are so many of
them!"*  
*'Chloe-san, could you take a look at the town from the sky? I'm
wondering...if maybe the whole town is filled with these guys...'*  
  
As Bluey-kun suggested, I raised Niru into the sky and looked down at
the town from his view.  
  
*‘...It's in a terrible state.’*  
  
The town, built into a hole in the mountains, was now dyed red by the
spreading Chaos and the robed group.  
  
The number is...at least a hundred. Maybe more. Where in the world did
all these people come from?  
  
*'Got a message from Saval! It seems he and the people who went to the
mansion were able to meet up safely, and they also ran into the red
group. They fought and the red-hoods escaped, so now they're defeating
the red hoods rampaging in the town while guiding the evacuation of the
residents.'*  
*'...Then let's join up with Saval-san and the others. With this many
opponents, acting in small groups is pointless.'*  
*'Yeah, okay! ...It seems the lord's mansion has been decided as the
evacuation point. Saval and the others are heading there too.'*  
  
The lord's mansion...ah, there it is. In this town built on a series of
steps, the lord's mansion is visible on a high plateau that overlooks
the town. That's it, according to the map information.  
  
"Lucille-san, we're moving!"  
"Yes, that's right. Staying here won't solve anything."  
  
Once I confirmed that Lucille-san had jumped onto my shoulder, I changed
my staff into a broom. It'll be faster to fly to the mansion.  
  
"Where are you planning to go...Chloe-san?"  
  
The moment I tried to take off, I felt a shock to my back, and I was
blown away into the wall of a building. ...I was attacked. By who?  
  
"...Ah, it was you. Poco-chan."  
"Hey there, it's been a while, hasn't it?"  
  
A small figure clad in a red robe, their face hidden by a hood. But from
their way of speaking, it's clearly Poco-chan. She was equipped with
gauntlets on both hands.  
  
I check on Lucille-san's safety. We were blown away together, but she
doesn’t seem to have taken damage. She seems fine. On the other hand, my
HP has been reduced by half...Let me recover with a potion.  
  
"I guess my master went easy on you. I thought you'd be dead...but you
look pretty lively."  
"...Where's the key?"  
"I don't have it anymore. I gave it to my boss. ...So, my job is back to
eliminating obstacles."  
  
Poco-chan waved her hand, and red-hooded figures appeared. They
surrounded me to make sure I couldn’t get away.  
  
...I'm done for. There’s no way to handle this many. One or two might be
manageable, but five, ten...there's nothing I can do. Chloe isn't strong
enough to handle this many.  
  
"I'm sorry, master...but I have to eliminate the obstacles."  
  
Poco-chan raised her weapon, but—  
  
"I've fouuuuund yooooouuuuuu!!!"  
"—Whoa, what was that!?"  
  
What was swung down from behind Poco-chan was a large scythe. Poco-chan
quickly dodged the scythe, but it was an attack filled with so much rage
that it could have taken her head off if it had hit her. ...Although I
don't think you'll see such a scene in this game, as it doesn't have any
depictions of missing parts.  
  
"I finally found you! The one who interfered with Lily's work that
time!!"  
  
Pointing at Poco-chan with a sharp gesture was, of course, Lily-chan,
that demon girl.  
  
"Why are you here!? I just went through all the trouble of setting you
up and throwing you in jail!"  
"Hah! I escaped taking advantage of this Chaos! But more than that,
you're still that lying white rabbit after all! You've made me unhappy
not once, but twice...I won't forgive you! I intend to wipe everyone
out, but I'll start by crushing you!"  
"Ugh, what a pain, being hated like this!!"  
  
Lily-chan was so angry she started fighting Poco-chan. Good, good, while
this is happening, I'll escape from here—  
  
"...Do you think I’ll let you get away, young lady?"  
  
Standing in my way was none other than the other red-hooded figures.
Even if Poco-chan leaves, I can't handle this number difference.  
  
"...Really, what an unpleasant bunch."  
"Fufu, I apologize. But this is for the sake of our organization. Now,
you must step off this stage—kyaa!?"  
  
One of the red-hooded figures who was speaking was attacked from behind.
Behind them was...an unfamiliar male swordsman. Then another person
appeared, and they began fighting the figures surrounding me.  
  
"I don't really get it, but it's okay to kill these guys, right?"  
"Y-yes...Thank you."  
"No, no, I'm just defeating the enemy...No wait! Right now I feel like a
hero who showed up in a pinch, don’t I? Damn, I'm awesome!"  
  
...After answering with a composed face, the swordsman became excited
and joyful.  
  
"Hey! Stop talking to that NPC and help me out here!"  
"Right! See ya!"  
  
The swordsman went to help his companions who were fighting the
red-hooded figures. ...Are they players?  
  
I don’t really understand, but thanks to Lily-chan and the players, I
was saved.  
Taking this opportunity, I left the place and flew to the lord's mansion
on my broom.
