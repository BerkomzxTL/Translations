# 77・My Victims’ Association

I never thought I'd meet them here of all places… Their matching gold
outfits are as dazzling as ever.  
  
"Light-kun, calm down!"  
"Rush! Are you planning to cause trouble again!?"  
  
Perhaps sensing the strained atmosphere between Light-kun and the large
man from their previous encounter, Kyle-san and someone from the golden
group stepped in. It looks like I can leave this to them.  
  
Thinking that, I headed towards the person I'm interested in.  
  
"Oliver-kun, isn't it?"  
"Hey, it's you again."  
  
Oliver-kun looked perplexed by the situation, but still answered. If I
remember correctly, he said a friend who could catch thieves would be
coming…  
  
"…Are they the acquaintances you were talking about?"  
"Yeah, they are. They're from a clan I've been working with recently. As
you can see, they caught the thieves."  
  
Oliver-kun pointed towards the three from before, who were indeed
captured.  
  
"So, you got the ore back? That's great~!"  
  
Miranda-san approached, having spotted us.  
  
"No… actually, they didn't have the ore."  
"What!? Did they already sell it?"  
"I don't know. They wouldn't say anything. They might have hidden it
somewhere before they got caught… I brought them here to try and find
out."  
  
The three, though not gagged, were surprisingly quiet. Are they resigned
to their fate… or plotting an escape… As I looked at them, I made eye
contact with a cat-eared beast girl, Azi.  
  
"Ugh… Dark Witch…"  
  
I’m happy to hear her call me a witch. Her expression is strained,
though. I returned her greeting with a smile of gratitude and
familiarity.  
  
"We meet again. It's good you were caught safely. If I remember
correctly, your name is Azi?"  
"Waah! Please don't blow me away like last time! Please!"  
  
I only called her name, so there's no need to be so scared.  
  
"...Eh? You over there, were you blown away too? By that witch?"  
"Oh, is that the case for you too, Shiny Gold-san?"  
  
The large man who was just arguing with Light-kun is now looking my way.
Am I imagining it, or is he slightly avoiding my gaze?  
  
"Were you blown away by her Dark Burst?"  
"Yeah, I was blown away! Without mercy!"  
"I was too! I’m scared of heights, but she blew me away ruthlessly!"  
  
The large man's face went pale, as if he was remembering that incident.
...I didn't know he had acrophobia, I'm sorry for blowing you away.  
  
"Wow, that was rough…"  
"Right? Not only me, but my clanmates were also blown away… It was
really scary."  
"Yup, I know, I know. Mine was at point-blank range, right in the face,
it was terrifying…"  
"Seriously!? She did that!?"  
  
Ah yes. I did hit her at point-blank range. The two were looking at me
fearfully. It seems like a friendship is budding between the captors and
the captured…  
  
"I was actually defeated by her once too…"  
"No way, you too? There are a lot of victims…"  
"She shows no mercy even to her allies!?"  
  
Even Light-kun… well, you have a point there. But when it comes to
Light-kun, we weren't friends yet.  
  
"What is with all of you…? Anyway, you were all hostile towards me, so I
just did my best."  
  
It's starting to sound like it's all my fault, but they have their own
issues. I attacked because you were hostile.  
  
"That's true, but…"  
"That was excessive…"  
"Ah, that's right..."  
  
Those were the words I heard from the three of them. ...The firepower is
too high, that's a problem. More than that, even Light-kun and the large
man who were arguing just a moment ago are getting along now.  
  
"I understand that feeling of terror when attacked…"  
  
And now Poco-chan is joining their conversation… No, it's different for
you.  
  
*'Should those who were chased by you go over there too?'*  
  
Lucille-san, please don't say that like you’re having fun. And Niru, why
are you nodding so much...?  
  
"I don't really understand, but things have calmed down. It's all thanks
to Chloe."  
"…………Kyle-san."  
  
Am I wrong, or does he seem to be stifling a laugh? You want to be sent
flying with that group too, don't you?  
  
As if to comfort me, Earl patted my head.  
You're the only one on my side here…  
  
"Um, I don't understand the situation well… but as before, our Rush
caused some trouble the other day."  
  
One of the gold-clad group members approached us. The previous incident
he’s talking about is probably the one with the red beast.  
  
He’s wearing a white robe with a gold base. From his appearance, he’s
probably a healer. He has a calm demeanor and seems like the type of
person who would be easy to talk to.  
  
The large man who had been arguing with Light-kun earlier frowned. That
must be Rush.  
  
"Friday, what trouble?"  
"What do you mean? The previous incident didn't necessitate hostility.
Yet it was you who was pointlessly taking hostile action, wasn't it?"  
"I was acting for the team's benefit… and for the others too..."  
"You were the leader in that situation. I told you before that you have
supervisory responsibility. And I told you to stop being influenced by
that other game. This game and that game have different gameplay
mechanics."  
"…………Hmph."  
  
Reprimanded by Friday, Rush-san awkwardly averted his gaze. It seems
Friday-san holds the higher position.  
  
"We are truly sorry for the last time. However, we're still new to this
game… and we didn't understand the nature of it… The importance placed
on role-playing…"  
  
Friday-san bowed in apology on behalf of Rush-san. If they were playing
other games, they might have been confused playing this one with that
mindset. SSO emphasizes role-playing in various aspects, which can be
difficult for ordinary players. The more experienced they are in other
games, the more difficult it may be.  
  
And the existence of role-players is rare in other games, or practically
non-existent. The fact that there are so many role-players makes SSO a
special and unique game.  
  
"I will forgive him for your sake. I would like to see him reflect on
his actions a little more, though..."  
"Now, now, Chloe. What good will arguing further do?"  
  
…As Chloe, I have no choice but to take this attitude… but perhaps it
would have been better to stop role-playing and interact as ordinary
players.  
  
"Thank you for your understanding. …Oh, I should introduce myself. I am
Friday, sub-master of the clan \[El Dorado\]."  
  
With that, Friday-san bowed. As sub-master, he is indeed above
Rush-san.  
  
"El Dorado…? Wait, is that the El Dorado from \[Frontier\]!?"  
  
One of the three bound people spoke up, the elf, so I guess it’s
Saval-kun.  
He stared in surprise at Friday-san and the other clan members behind
him. Not only him, but Azi-chan and Bluey-kun also looked at them.  
  
\[Frontier\] is the name of another VRMMO, isn't it? A fantasy game, one
of the popular VRMMOs that has been running for several years. Its
popularity eclipses that of SSO.  
  
"Yes, it's that El Dorado. Although, the Frontier side disbanded
recently, so only Rush, myself, and a few others from Frontier are
here."  
"Yes, I knew that… but I never thought I'd meet you in SSO…"  
"Really, looking closely, there are some familiar avatars! We played
against you in last year's dungeon time attack tournament, do you
remember?"  
"Our avatars are different now, so I don't think you'd recognize us."  
  
Saval-kun seems to have forgotten his role-playing in his surprise. The
atmosphere is different from usual. On the other hand, the other two are
as usual.  
  
…Except for Azi-chan, I don't know about Bluey-kun. Still, it seems the
three of them were Frontier players as well.  
  
*'Kyle-san, is their clan famous?'*  
*'Well, I haven't played Frontier, so I don't know much… Light-kun might
know.'*  
  
Kyle-san opened a group chat for the three of us and asked Light-kun the
same question.  
  
*'I only heard about it online… but they were definitely a famous clan
in Frontier. They were so skilled they won the annual time attack
tournament. They also apparently hold the fastest clear times for
several high-difficulty dungeons in the game. Well, as he just said,
they broke up… but I never thought they'd form a similar clan here…'*  
*'Seriously, they were that famous…'*  
*'What should we do… I blew away a clan like that!?'*  
  
Even though it's a different game, I'm a little surprised to have blown
away people who were so famous in another game.  
  
I unconsciously looked at Rush-san. He was also a Frontier player, a
member of a famous clan, so he must have been well-known.  
  
"…We’re all here."  
  
But his retreating figure unfortunately didn’t appear that way.  
  
"Now, we must hear their story. Where did you take the ore you stole
from Oliver?"  
  
Friday-san's words changed the atmosphere. The thieves' happy
expressions vanished, replaced with bitter ones.  
  
"Hey, Saval-kun. Let's talk… these people might be able to help us."  
"Now that this has happened, we can't do anything on our own. For their
sake…"  
"That's right… Hey, let me tell you something--"  
  
The three seem to have a story. Saval-kun, one of them, returned to his
usual self and began to speak seriously when…  
  
"Heeey! That's enough!"  
"Who's there!"  
  
I didn't know who it was, but I heard a cheerful voice that didn't suit
the situation.  
  
At the same time, something was thrown in, and the sound of it breaking
echoed around my feet. I instinctively looked down and saw a plume of
red smoke rising from the broken bottle.  
  
"…Red mist!?"  
  
My vision was already entirely red. All I could see were the shadows of
confused people and the sound of coughing as the red mist suddenly
appeared. The entire entrance was engulfed.  
  
—The appearance of red mist means…  
  
"Ah, there you are. Stealing the gate key is terrible, you know."  
"You…!"  
  
I looked towards the intruders. Through the mist was a man in a crimson
robe, gripping Saval-kun's collar.  
  
"I didn't expect you to come to us, that saves me the trouble of having
to look for you."  
"Huh? What are you talking about… ah… you are!"  
  
The man must have noticed us. His face hidden by his hood, only his
smiling mouth is visible.
