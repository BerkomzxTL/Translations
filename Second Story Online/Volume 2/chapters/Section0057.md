# 57・Let’s Use the Warehouse

Well, I still have some business to attend to in town. I’ve never used
it before, but I have a reason to go there today.  
  
It's the warehouse. A free warehouse given to each player. It's said
that if you get something important, it's best to store it in the
warehouse. It's said that that's the only safe place in this game.  
  
Even famous thief players apparently can't crack the vault. Well, it's
probably protected by the system.  
  
So I came to the facility where I can use the world's safest warehouse.
By the way, it seems that you can retrieve items stored in the warehouse
from a different location than where you stored them. Just like a
game.  
  
The reason I came to the warehouse is that I've been carrying a lot of
stuff around lately. This game has a quantity limit on items. I had a
lot of leeway, so I didn't worry about it until now, but I'm about to
hit the limit. So I'm selling unnecessary items and storing things I
don't use now but think I might need later.  
  
For now, I'll keep the materials I might use... Ah, I’m reluctant to
sell the \[Noble Lady's Dress\], my starting outfit. I guess I'll put
this in the warehouse. My old gothic lolita outfit too. And let's store
some money as well.  
  
So I was putting items into the warehouse...  
  
"I'm sorry. This item cannot be stored."  
  
The receptionist said something similar to a system message. What's
wrong?  
  
"Ah, is it this?"  
  
The rejected item was \[Mysterious Poison\]. For some reason, I had
acquired this poison. I couldn't figure out what it was at all, and it
was something I couldn't handle.  
  
"Um..."  
"What is it?"  
  
The receptionist's face was somehow stern. Her gaze is fixed on the
poison in my hand.  
  
*'Chloe, put that away immediately and leave this place. Of course,
without raising suspicion.'*  
  
What a coincidence, Lucille-san. I was just about to do that.  
  
"Ah, this is for a friend. Isn't it a rare color? A merchant told me
it's a very precious, vintage liquor."  
  
I told a quick lie and quietly put it into my inventory from the bag on
my waist.  
  
"I see. Many of the items that can't be stored are special items. Among
them are some that are forbidden and taboo, so... my apologies."  
  
I hate the idea of ​​it being something forbidden. Just hearing about it
sounds scary. Maybe it's because it's poison.  
  
I left the facility with a forced smile.  
  
*'I never thought you would have something like that.'*  
  
As soon as I left the facility, Lucille-san hopped onto my left
shoulder. Niru is on my right shoulder, by the way. It's a little
heavy.  
  
*'And to take it out so openly...'*  
"Well, it is poison..."  
  
When I think about it, I was showing the poison in a conspicuous place.
It's an action that would make anyone suspicious.  
  
*'Chloe, do you know what this poison is?'*  
"Do you know what it is?"  
  
I told Lucille-san that I had acquired it by chance. Lucille-san
apparently knows about this poison. Otherwise, she wouldn't have warned
me earlier.  
  
*'\[Cursed Poison\], huh... I've never seen the real thing before. It's
a special ritualistic poison made using a plant that grows by absorbing
the blood and resentment of living things, and the blood of a magician.
It doesn't just kill the drinker, but also captures their soul and
incorporates it into a spell. Its method of creation is considered
taboo.'*  
  
It's a really dangerous thing. I can't believe I've been carrying
something like this around all this time...  
  
"I'd get arrested just for possessing this, right?"  
*'Of course. That's why it was dangerous just now.'*  
  
I almost got arrested before I could do my job as a guardian. Still,
just possessing it is enough for arrest.  
  
"The creator wouldn't just get arrested, either."  
*'That's right. Should we expose the village head? We might get a
reward.'*  
"If I tell people about it, I'll be suspected for keeping it hidden all
this time."  
  
Even if I didn't know, I've been carrying around a dangerous item, so
I'd be suspected. Besides, if I did that, there would’ve been no point
in helping the village chief.  
*'Well, that's true. Then you should dispose of it quickly.'*  
"……Don't you think it's a bit of a waste?"  
*'I understand how you feel, but only the creator can use it. It's best
to throw it away before you raise any unnecessary suspicion.'*  
  
Unfortunately, let's do that. It doesn't have any use anyway.  
  
*'Still, I don't understand the purpose of that suspicious demon...'*  
"Her purpose seemed to be the resurrection of the dead... but I don't
understand it either."  
  
The one who taught the method of making this poison was probably that
demon from before. As Lucille-san mentioned earlier, the method of
making this poison is considered a forbidden technique. So, the village
head shouldn't have had the opportunity to learn about it.  
  
She taught the village head the method to resurrect his daughter... but
what was the demon's purpose in the end?  
  
*'There are all kinds of demons. It’s true that most of them are
certainly harmful to us. Whatever the demon's purpose was, whether it's
this poison or the purpose of making the village head do it, it won’t be
a good thing.'*  
"Yes... By the way, does that demon have any connection to the man in
the red hood?"  
  
I know that the man in the red hood's purpose is related to Chaos.
Perhaps that demon is also related to it?  
  
*'I don't know at this point. It's certainly true though that they are
hostile to us humans.'*  
"Don't demons seek out Chaos?"  
*'Well, I don't know.'*  
  
She said it so casually.  
  
"...There are some things even Lucille-san doesn't know."  
*'Chloe. Even though I'm older than you, don't assume I know
everything.'*  
  
Well, I agree with that statement. It's the same for me.  
If you think about it, she’s been living alone in the forest as a
guardian all this time.  
  
"Yes, you've been shut up alone in the forest until now, so it's no
wonder you don't know."  
*'……Are you still holding a grudge about turning you into a child?'*  
  
She didn't apologize.  
  
*'Even so, I have been gathering information in the forest using the
cat's eyes.'*  
"Ah, you were watching through Belle-san."  
  
Belle is the black cat who is currently acting as Lucille-san's body.
She was originally her familiar. Considering that, when I saw her in
town, she must have been gathering information. At that time, she was
probably looking for someone who could help her with the red beast.  
  
"I remember now, I saw Belle-san. I even chased after her."  
*'Ah, you were the one who chased after me then. Besides children, only
you and Tsubaki chased me.'*  
"I'm sorry for chasing you then. ...No, that’s not it. I have one
question."  
*'What is it?'*  
  
I remembered something. It also involves Kyle-san.  
  
"Why did you keep going after only handsome guys, Lucille-san? Could it
be that Lucille-san—"  
*'……It's a misunderstanding! Absolutely not!'*  
  
She frantically slapped my cheeks. It hurt a little.  
  
"Then what is it?"  
*'It’s Belle! Belle has always liked beautiful things. She has a habit
of approaching them! As you know, familiars will move if you give them
instructions, but their bodies and wills are free. Unless you use a
technique that can freely manipulate them, you can't control all the
movements of a familiar.'*  
  
Unfortunately, my guess was wrong. Well, it makes sense now that
Lucille-san is possessing Belle, since she acted according to
Lucille-san's instructions when she was still a familiar.  
  
Within the scope of instructions, I think Belle acted as she pleased to
some extent, so the act of approaching handsome men at that time must
have been done by Belle.  
  
*'So what were we talking about… Ah, the demon. It's said that the Black
Chaos Dragon defeated by the power of a hero hundreds of years ago was
originally one of the demon kings. Therefore, it can't be said that
there are no demons who target Chaos.'*  
"What don't you understand? Don't you know?"  
*'That's an old story. Things may be different now. To back that up, the
demons of today, or rather demon-kind as we call them, are those who
harm humans and have clashed with heroes many times... but I’ve never
heard of them meddling with Chaos itself. Just as there are both good
and evil humans, demons are also diverse. So my conclusion is...'*  
"You don't know, huh?"  
  
It's a power that could destroy the world, so it's strange that
demons... no, demon-kind doesn't seek it. It seems like they would.  
Or rather, was that child really a demon in the first place? Maybe she
just looked like a demon, but was actually human, and we're just
mistaken.  
  
"Hmm, there are so many things I don't understand about the world..."  
*'Indeed.'*  
  
For now, the only thing I know is that I should dispose of this
poison.  
  
*'Don't throw the poison away here! If you don't dispose of it properly,
it'll cause a big problem!'*  
"Tell me that sooner! I almost threw it away!"  
  
Is disposing of it special too? This was a troublesome thing to pick
up...  
The one responsible for picking it up is yawning sleepily.
