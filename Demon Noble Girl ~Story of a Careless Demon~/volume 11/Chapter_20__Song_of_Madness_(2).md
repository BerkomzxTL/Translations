# Chapter 20: Song of Madness (2)

"There's nothing to be worried about. Rose was amusing me by creating some interesting things, but her usefulness has come to an end."

"Ah, I see..."

I never thought she would so easily destroy Rose, who was one of her subordinates.

She is... truly a 'demon'.

"...What are you doing?!"

At that moment, it was Axel who raised his voice.

Come to think of it, even though Axel didn't get along with Estelle, he was very angry when she collapsed.

Perhaps it was his passionate nature, or perhaps he felt feelings for his unrelated sibling, but when Axel realised that the Queen had murdered Rose, even though he did not understand exactly what she had done, his anger shook off the curse that had bound him and he ran towards the Queen in a furious state.

"Take this, you bitch!"

Axel's skill is \[Ability Stealing\]. It's a powerful ability for a human, but there's a problem with it.

"—What!?"

Axel's skill, which he used to try and forcefully steal from Sylberthal without even analyzing her, flashed and disappeared as soon as it touched Sylberthal.

"Gah... ah"

Axel suddenly collapsed, clutching his chest. Sylberthal's demons here were doing nothing. They were simply watching Axel self-destruct with faint smiles.

"Nui."

"Yes."

At Sylberthal's voice, a maid with black hair and dark skin stepped forward happily and casually thrust her hand into Axel's heart, while he was lying face down.

"Guah..."

Axel convulsed violently, his eyes rolling back, as something was pulled out of him. Without even glancing at the lifeless Axel, Nui smiled at me.

"Customer, how about a fresh soul?"

"I have no need for a soul that tattered."

Axel's \[Ability Stealing\] is so powerful that it could be said that he's nearly invincible against humans.

But Axel didn't realize that stealing someone else's ability wasn't something that could be done without paying a price.

Abilities are like tattoos attached to the soul. If I told you that stealing them would be like peeling off a person's skin as you pass them by, would you understand how difficult it is?

Without realizing it, every time he used his ability, a vital part of Axel's soul was being torn away, like tearing off frozen metal, and his soul had become so damaged that he could no longer hope for an afterlife.

So now that he had laid his hands on a real demon, the rebound must have been shocking enough to tear apart what was left of his soul.

"Is that so? Then there's no need to hold on to it."

With that, Nui crushed Axel's soul.

I don't feel any sympathy for him because he was stealing abilities from others, but if he had realized that it was wrong, he might have had a different fate.

"...A...Axel..."

Gino, who had lost both his younger siblings, Rose and Axel, in an instant, sank down with a pale face.

"So, what do you say? Will you join me?"

Sylberthal asked me as if nothing had happened.

"There's one thing I wanted to ask you."

Although Sylberthal's proposal is an interesting one for a top-ranking demon, I still have one question.

"Why did you create the demon and spirit chimeras?""

It goes against the laws of the world. It's like combining white blood cells and red blood cells in the body. Such a thing is like a cancer cell that has occurred in the world.

Neither demons nor spirits would accept such a thing instinctively. Even Sylberthal, who is a pure-blooded demon, should be the same, so how could she do something like that?

Judging from Rose's attitude, she was probably the main person who was making them.

If Rose is no longer useful, it means that the chimera is more complete than I realized.

"Yurushia, I enjoy beautiful things."

Sylberthal said this abruptly, stood up, and leaned against the railing overlooking the royal capital.

"I love shining things. I love bright things. Why should I, who loves such things, have to live in a dark and stagnant Demon World? Though the Demon World is our homeland, I cannot deny it."

Sylberthal reached out to the still-bright blue sky, even though it was almost evening, and turned to me with pitch-black eyes and a twisted smile.

"If we combine all demons and spirits, perhaps the demon world they inhabit will become brighter. If we fill the spirit world with chimeras and break down the hateful wall that separates the demon world and the spirit world, the demon world might become a little brighter, don't you think?"

"...Sylberthal..."

She's crazy... Even if she were to destroy the laws of this world just for the fun of it, and even if she ended up destroying countless other worlds on accident, she would just laugh it off.

Something stirred inside me.

"Yes, that's it."

Sylberthal approached me silently with a look of delight.

"Yurushia... don't you want to seal the \[True Demon Lord\] within you?"

"..."

True Demon Lord――The moment I heard those words, knowledge of the \[Devil\] within me surfaced from the depths.

Unlike the countless 'self-proclaimed demon lords' or 'evil gods' that parasitize worlds, this is a being born from the \[World\] itself, created to annihilate all living things within that world.

A 'reset mechanism' solely for the \[World\] – that is the True Demon Lord.

"I can seal it. That's what the \[Dark Beast\] wants too."

"...Rinne."

I see... so that's why Rinne was acting strange.

If I become the True Demon Lord, I will probably no longer be myself. Rinne had no choice but to go along with Sylberthal's plan, even if it meant destroying several worlds, in order to save \[My\] existence.

Rinne... are you really a demon...?

Sylberthal clapped her hands and Etincelle, with fiery red hair, reverently placed a small cup fashioned from a tiny skull and bones in front of me. Meanwhile, Neige, whose hair was as white as silver, poured a thick, pitch-black liquid into the cup from an ancient-looking bottle.

"It's a two-thousand-year-old noble wine made from the matured blood and souls of 10,000 sinners."

Despite its appearance, a rich, sweet fruit-like aroma wafted.

Tension ran through my servants and Sylberthal's maids smiled devilishly as Sylberthal whispered demonic words.

"It's my secret stash. If you drink this cup, the \[True Demon Lord\] will be sealed by the grudges of the spirits, and your power will increase even more. Come now, take a sip, Yurushia."

"..."

I reached for the goblet of wine and met Sylberthal's pitch-black eyes, which were fixed on me with a soft smile. No matter how I look at it, it looks more like a cursed artifact than anything else.

If I drink this, the \[True Demon Lord\] that will destroy the world will be sealed, and Rinne's wish to save me will be fulfilled.

Even if Sylberthal were to bring about the world's destruction, I think I could postpone it for a few thousand years if I were to play along with her. If I gained enough power in the meantime, I might even be able to fight back.

But...

Is that really okay?

I think Sylberthal is telling the truth. No matter how consumed by madness, demons can't lie in transactions with another high-ranking demon. Telling a lie in a deal could compromise one's very existence as a demon.

But... I feel like she's leaving out something important.

What is it... it's the secret of Sylberthal's power...

No... that's not it. Stop pretending to be someone you're not and stop overthinking things.

I...

"...!"

Maintaining a natural smile, I tilted the goblet and poured the black wine onto the floor, sensing a murky malice surge up from around me.

Sylberthal's black eyes narrowed slightly, a mix of dissatisfaction and amusement.

"...Yurushia? Is that your answer?"

"Yes, it is. Sylberthal..."

The whites of my eyes eroded to black, and my pupils turned a blood-red.

The demonic energy that surged from me rotted the tables and chairs, shaking the castle and the city. I bared my crimson fangs and laughed cheerfully.

"I don't like you. Come on, Sylberthal. I'll play with you."

I don't like the fact that you got Rinne involved.
