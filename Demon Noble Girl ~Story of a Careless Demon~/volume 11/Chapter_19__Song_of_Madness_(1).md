# Chapter 19: Song of Madness (1)

"H-hey, you!"

When I addressed the Queen of the Sylber Kingdom, Sylberthal, by her first name, the First Prince, Gino, opened his eyes wide, and the Second Prince, Axel, cried out in surprise.

While my attendants and Sylberthal's maids didn't even bat an eyelid, the Queen turned only her pitch-black eyes towards Axel.

"Uh..."

No one said anything to him, and that alone made the hot-tempered Axel go quiet like a frightened child.

"It's dark in here. Yurushia, come to the terrace."

"Yeah"

Sylberthal said so and started walking, followed by the four maids and Rose.

I nodded slightly and followed them with my attendants, and a few seconds later, Gino and Axel, who had been frozen in place, hurriedly ran over to catch up with us.

"...H-hey..."

"...Princess Yurushia..."

They called out to me in small voices because they could still see Sylberthal's back. Well, if the Queen and a princess from another country suddenly start moving as if they had made a prior arrangement, ignoring the princes, it would be confusing.

I wish I could've said something, even a light joke, but I didn't have that much leeway.

...It's been a while since I've felt a thrill like this. Compared to that flat-faced \[Demon Lord\], Hir... Hira... Hirame, her walking alone exerts a pressure that's almost on par with Rinne's full power.

And although not as much as those four maids, I felt the presence of several more Arch Demons of Rose's class from the darkness.

I guess if you're a demon of Sylberthal's level, it's easy to have over a dozen Arch Demons under your command.

Sylberthal, the \[Mad Princess\].

One of the three oldest \[Demon Lords\] in the Demon World.

A genuine monster that has existed since before the birth of humanity.

...I wonder why someone like that is so casually appearing in the material world.

Well, it's okay. I've been challenged a lot, but I don't think she's trying to eliminate me outright. I'm sure she'll tell me why. Probably.

We passed through a wide stone corridor with walls, ceiling, and floor polished like mirrors, and arrived at a spacious terrace with plenty of light, from which we could see the royal capital of the Sylber Holy Church, the surrounding forest, and even the hazy cityscape of the surrounding territories in the distance.

...Although I didn't feel like I was climbing, it seemed like we had somehow reached the top of the castle.

On the terrace, there was a table made of finely woven platinum wire and two chairs of the same design facing each other. Neige, the silver-haired maid, pulled out Sylberthal's chair, and Etincelle, the red-haired maid, pulled out the other chair and smiled at me.

Sylberthal and I sat down on the chairs at the same time, and Nui, the black-haired maid, and Leyon, the golden-haired maid, poured black tea into white porcelain teacups decorated with gold.

"Humans do make some good things, don't they? Just a short while ago, they were still smashing bones with stones."

Sylberthal traced the rim of her cup with her finger, her eyes narrowed. Just a short time ago... was that tens of thousands of years ago?

Gino and Axel, who hadn't even been given chairs to sit on, just stood there looking confused.

"Oh, what were you doing before that?"

"Nothing much, it was no different from now. After all, it was I who gave the culture of the human world to people. Of course, Yurushia, the same goes for your previous world."

"Oh... you seem to know a lot..."

She gave culture to multiple worlds, including here and Earth...? So she's the reason why so many worlds have similar cultures.

And she also knows about my past life, so I can't let my guard down.

Moreover, why would she say something like that in front of the humans here? I couldn't help but smile wryly, but Sylberthal laughed softly.

"Yurushia, I know everything about you, my dear."

"I see... fufu."

Damn, I can't help but laugh.

"Speaking of which, Yurushia, you've been playing in my garden quite a bit, haven't you?"

"Garden? Oh, my apologies. I thought it was more like a pasture."

"Yes, indeed. More like a farm, actually. They say they get good things from your garden, but mine isn't bad either. Have you tasted it?"

"Well, I think the flavor is a little lacking..."

The Holy Church worships Sylberthal as a goddess, and very good things grow there, but the fertilizer has a slightly artificial smell. When I told her this honestly, Sylberthal let out a joyful chuckle.

"Hohohoho, that's my dear child. After all, play is no fun unless it's with an 'equal' opponent."

Well said. It's true that a \[Demon Lord\] and a \[Devil\] are equals, but there is a clear 'gap' in power between Sylberthal and me.

Attacking the Holy Kingdom and invading the Holy Church were nothing more than fun games for Sylberthal.

"Your garden looks delicious, but why didn't you eat anything from your previous world? You went through all the trouble to come back, so why did you leave without eating much? It must have been ripe for the picking."

"Well..."

The Earth was overflowing with souls that were too rotten for spirits or demons to exist. By that point, it was no longer a garden to harvest from, but a hunting ground.

I think the \[World\] that summoned me probably expected me to wipe out humanity with demons.

But--

"Sorry, I didn't think about it that deeply. It seemed like a pain."

Sylberthal looked dumbfounded for a moment at my words, but then burst out laughing again.

"Ahahahahahahahahaha! That's right, you really are a \[Devil\] after all. The other \[Devil\] was also the kind of guy who didn't do anything except for his own pleasure."

Um... the other \[Devil\]? You mean the self-proclaimed "older brother" who occasionally sends me "wisdom"? So the reason I became a \[Devil\] wasn't because my consciousness was closer to a humans, but because my personality was "casual"?

I couldn't help but gaze into the distance in shock at this newly discovered fact.

"You really are just as I expected, Yurushia. You will become my successor, the Queen, a goddess, and rule this country - no, this world."

"...Huh?"

I involuntarily replied after hearing Sylberthal's sudden proposal.

What is she saying...? Not only me, but also the two humans who had been overwhelmed by Sylberthal's intimidation, and had been listening to the demons' frank conversation without even understanding what we were saying, cut in.

"Your Majesty! This is not something that should be decided so casually!"

"That's right, Your Majesty! The Holy Kingdom won't keep quiet!"

At Gino and Axel's words, Sylberthal opened her eyes slightly as if noticing their presence for the first time, then curved the corners of her mouth into a smile.

"Gino, Axel, are you still here? Weren't you each trying to make Yurushia your Queen? What is this strong complaint of yours that has you opening your mouth without permission?"

Gino and Axel were a little surprised by her words - then they looked at each other with a bit of understanding.

They had both approached me as a good pawn to make themselves king and take over the Sylber Kingdom. Well, Axel looked down on me at first.

"T-then, my engagement to Princess Yurushia..."

"What are you saying, Gino! I was originally going to welcome her as my fianc√©e..."

"Hmph, didn't you cause trouble in the Holy Kingdom and get rejected by Taliterudo?"

"That's because of Estelle..."

"There's plenty to choose from, Yurushia. Anyone will do. It doesn't matter if it's these two or whoever you choose."

"Your Majesty!"

"Hey, hey, what a joke--"

"Silence."

With just one word, with neither intimidation nor spirit language, the Queen silenced the two excited men, who stopped breathing and shut their mouths, covered in sweat.

"So... what's your purpose?"

Sylberthal turned her gaze back to me, letting out a sigh.

"Nothing much, just a game. To rule while pretending to be human, you have to insert suitable people at intervals according to human lifespans, otherwise it will look unnatural. If I and Yurushia rule alternately, people won't find it strange."

"I see..."

I can understand that... maybe? I thought she could just use an Arch Demon, but it turns out that that candidate was Rose.

But then I appeared. As long as the opponent is of equal standing, they can enjoy playing the game, using people and the world as a board while ruling alternately. But... was that all?

Feeling something was off, I reached for the tea that had been prepared for me to gather my thoughts.

Oh, this is bone china. It's obvious what kind of bone it is. I took a sip of the pitch-black tea, and although it was of good quality, it had a slightly tasteless flavor.

"...It's bitter."

"Hmm. That's right. Even so, it's gotten better. Speaking of which, Rose told me that you have an interesting cook."

"Yes, that's right. Fannie."

When I called out, Fannie, who seemed more on guard than usual, took out some baked goods from a subspace storage.

"I had him make these for me."

"Ohoho"

Sylberthal picked up one with her finger, looking amused as I lined up the sweets that had been made possible by training the ability user, the young boy, Mark.

Sylberthal put the cookie in her mouth, chewed it slowly, and twisted her face with a grin.

"This is good. You know, Yurushia. I want the one who made this."

A sudden demand.

Well, I forced myself to hire him because he was worth that much.

"Oh, Sylberthal. He's quite expensive, you know?"

I have no intention of handing him over free. Now, just as I was wondering what I should ask for, Sylberthal spoke first.

"The price is my life?"

With a demonic smile, Sylberthal said this as if to test me.

After all that work trying to recruit me, if I asked for that now, an all-out war between me and Sylberthal would start immediately.

"Well... for now, I guess I'll take a demon's life."

I chose a safer harassment route in response.

I wouldn't mind giving Mark to Sylberthal, but if she wants to play word games like that...

"Hmm."

Sylberthal murmured, and with a slight movement of her finger, she drew Rose closer and plunged her finger into Rose's chest.

"...Eh?"

For a moment, Rose looked dumbfounded, but then she pulled out what resembled a pitch black heart. Without even looking at Rose, who collapsed with a stunned look on her face, Sylberthal placed the Demon's Core on the table with a gentle smile.

"Is this okay?"

"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Yeah."

Rose's lifeless eyes reflected mine, and I stared intently at the mad princess smiling before me.
