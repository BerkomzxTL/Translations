# Chapter 7: The Magnificent Everyday Life of a Demon God (2)

Clara Sendel. She was raised as an orphan in a small village on the outskirts of a small country in the southern part of the continent.

Clara wasn't an orphan from the start. Although she never saw her father, her good-looking mother, who lived in the city at the time, somehow always had a lot of money even though she was always drinking, so she never had to worry about living.

Perhaps the problem was that young Clara couldn't recognize her mother as family, having no contact with her. The housekeeper her mother hired didn't show any particular affection for Clara either, so Clara grew up without understanding what a family was.

A turning point came for Clara when she was four years old, when her mother died of alcoholism.   
  
 The housekeeper never did any more work than she was paid for, but as a final job she took Clara to the small village where her mother was from, and left her in the church orphanage along with the money her mother had left behind.

Despite her circumstances, Clara adapted to life at the orphanage surprisingly easily. Almost no one in the village knew Clara's mother, and Clara never cried for her mother. Instead, she played with the other orphans and helped out at the church like an ordinary child.

It wasn't that Clara was so normal that she fit in, but rather that she wasn't normal at all, which made it easy for her to fit in.

Seeing this, the priest of the church took out a small magical tool from an old box that he had not opened since he was assigned to the village, and muttered softly to himself in the empty chapel.

"I've found what you was looking for."

The Church - what the Sylber Kingdom that controlled it from behind the scenes sought was someone with a rare soul.   
  
 Special abilities (skills) were, in a sense, a 'bonus'. The point was the strength of the 'soul' that obtained it, because someone with a strong soul could be used in various ways.

Those with strong souls would be, for example, heroes or heroic-class individuals. Of course, it's not easy to find a hero, but there are a fair number of heroic-class individuals. 

There are also people with strong souls who meet certain special conditions, one of which is to have a soul from another world. Those with souls strong enough to cross over to that other world have certain characteristics.

It was a strong sense of self that was clearly different from others. Even if they looked ordinary on the surface, many of those with souls strong enough to travel to another world had a hint of "madness" within them. 

It didn't matter whether they had memories of a past life or not. In Clara's case, she was clearly in a different situation from a normal child, and she naturally accepted it as if she had decades of life experience.

Clara was a child with no memories of a past life. Taken to a large church in the city, Clara played with a two-year-old girl named Estelle who had been brought there at the same time, and they took a kind of test, but while Estelle was taken somewhere far away, Clara was returned to the village after being 'educated' in the church's basement.   
  
 From then on, life in the village began again, but Clara gradually changed.

Her slightly swollen eyelids and childlike round face became sharper, and her dull blonde hair began to shine a honey color. She was able to handle the power of the spirit of light, and her physical abilities greatly improved.

As a result, the beautiful girl was recognized as a hero by the church, and accepted by the people, and her inner self began to change greatly.

"I'm one of the chosen people, so I don't have to put up with anything."

The reason she helps others was to feel the pleasure of being praised.

Doing church work was for earning a lot of money and living in luxury. 

Despite living as a villager, she despised the villagers in her heart, hated chores, bought flashy slaves who looked like male prostitutes, and used her beauty to ensnare hero-class individuals who similarly despised commoners, adding them to her group.

The reason why Clara chose Mark, who was ordinary in appearance and only gave food boosting abilities, as her companion was due to the complex she felt about being the only one of village origins, surrounded by companions who were nobles or wealthy.

She treated Mark, who was also from the village, like a servant, and once she had captivated him with her beauty, she tried to relieve her complex by making him treat her like a princess. 

In front of her companions, she would subtly show concern for Mark, and then induce her jealous companions to harass him, enjoying it from the shadows.

Clara's life gradually became more extravagant, and she became increasingly arrogant. 

As a 'hero' recognized by the church and connected with kings of various small countries, even ordinary nobles couldn't complain about her. She attended parties hosted by the country, wearing expensive costumes that ordinary nobles couldn't afford, and mocked the noble ladies, stealing the eyes of men.

She was no longer a village girl. Her power rivaled that of a country's king, and her beauty was incomparable to that of noble ladies. 

But maintaining that lifestyle required a lot of money. She couldn't wear the same dress or accessories twice. She used expensive beauty products from the church and the Holy Kingdom without hesitation, and stayed in luxury inns every day to take baths. 

Although she received assistance as a hero, it was not enough no matter how many monsters she hunted. Clara began to take on suspicious jobs assigned by the church, and even that wasn't enough, so she sold some of her slaves to noblewomen and took the reward from Mark, who was a burden to her.

However, Mark had been useful in his own way. Instead of the slaves who could only look good, he did chores, cooked, and managed the party's health.   
  
 Then Marc left the party. In reality, his party members, jealous of him, had stopped paying him and threatened him until he quit. With their reckless spending, Clara and the others were starting to struggle without him.

Then, by chance, Clara reunited with Mark in a town they happened to visit.

She tried to persuade Mark to join her again, but he had already been hired by some 'young lady'. 

Seeing that Mark was dressed better than when he was in the party and seemed to have more money, Clara told him that he could come back if he paid her as an apology.

She thought that Mark was in love with her. There is no way that a young man from a village who had lived in a small world would not fall in love with a beautiful girl like her.

If she showed him her noble-like blonde hair, which was rarely seen in the village, he would understand the difference in social standing.

Smiling at Mark with that thought, he returned an awkwardly ambiguous smile, and then a beautiful voice like a silver bell came from the large carriage.

"Is there something you need from my servant?"

A dazzling golden glow... A girl as beautiful as a doll with golden hair and golden eyes appeared, and Clara took a step back, intimidated by her delicate smile. 

Could such a beautiful girl exist? She looked about the same age as Clara or perhaps a little younger, but her way of walking, the movement of her fingers, and every one of her actions were more refined than any noblewoman she had ever seen. Compared to her, the noble ladies of the small country seemed rustic, and her own blonde hair, which she had been so proud of, now looked nothing more than a pale brown compared to the girl. 

The difference in level was just too great. Even before her companions could be captivated by the girl who seemed like a princess from a great nation, they were dumbfounded. The two maids who alighted from the carriage next were also stunningly beautiful, and even the butler and female knight who caught Clara's eye were beautiful. Everyone was so speechless and breathless in the presence of these women that only Clara, gripping her own hair, clenched her teeth in response to the young lady's smile. 

\*

"Now, shall we hear your story?"

As I smiled, everyone stared at me with their mouths agape, except for Clara, the hero, who glared at me.   
  
 Hmm... is it just her? I tried to suppress my intimidation, but did I leak it somewhere and intimidate her?

"Give Mark back! You must have tricked Mark and are using him for free, aren't you!? I won't forgive you for that!"

Clara glared at me and said such a thing as if she were throwing a tantrum. It's fine, but listening to Mark's story makes me want to tell her to look in the mirror.

After hearing CLara's words, I turned to Mark, who was standing diagonally from me.

"Oh, is that so? Mark. Are you working for free?"

It was neither a loud nor a soft voice, but everyone around here should be able to hear it. To my question, Mark hesitated slightly but answered honestly.

"N-no, I received four large gold coins as a contract fee! I'm still an apprentice, but I receive five gold coins a month!"

The onlookers gasped at those words.

Well, that's to be expected. As a servant of a noble in the Holy Kingdom, it's not such a huge amount, but for a boy around Mark's age in this area, it would be enviable to receive even one gold coin as a live-in apprentice. 

Moreover, only extremely skilled craftsmen would be able to receive a contract fee. Even so, in a world where even one large gold coin would be considered a windfall as living expenses, it's clear to anyone that this amount is exorbitant.

"That's no big deal." 

"Really? For reference, could you tell me how much you gave to Mark?"

When asked, Clara looked around at her companions with a troubled expression.

Judging from Clara's equipment, I think she's the type to spend five or ten gold coins like water, but her companions hurriedly averted their eyes at Clara's gaze. 

They can't lie because Mark, the person involved, is right there. According to him, he was getting less than 10 silver coins a month, and since he had to pay for his own lodging, Mark was on the verge of bankruptcy.

"Ugh..."

Clara groaned, biting her lower lip because no one was defending her.

The onlookers, watching our exchange, seemed to understand the situation and looked at them suspiciously.

Originally, I had planned to use Mark as a bait to get in touch with the heroes and find out more about the church, but after seeing Clara, I changed my plans. 

I mean, just looking at her behavior, it's clear. The only people who have ever approached me directly have either been incredibly tough or incredibly foolish.

"Hmph, remember this! I'll definitely rescue Mark from your hands!" 

”””Clara!”””

Clara ran away, leaving her friends to chase after her.   
  
 Hmm. Maybe she's not that stupid after all? She left before her wounds could get worse as she sensed the change in everyone's gaze. I'm sure she'll be back.

"Lady Yurushia, what should we do with them?"

Noah approached me quietly and asked in a low voice. Asking quietly means, 'should he and the others just get rid of them if it's too bothersome?'

"Well, look into them a little. Especially their finances."

When I answered, Noah grinned with a demonic smile. No, I don't intend to do anything inhumane, but if I leave her alone after she insulted me, my servants will be annoyed, and I think I should make her pay for what she did to my newly-hired cook, Mark.

Clara, I'll show you who you picked a fight with.
