# Chapter 21: Battlefield of Madness (1)

Sylberthal's expression faded, and her pitch-black eyes, devoid of light, met mine as the corners of her lips curled into a demonic grin that reached her ears.

"Truly, you are a fine 'demon'. Very well, I shall teach you a lesson."

Sylberthal's inky black hair lost its luster and spread out like a peacock's tail, enveloping me. At that moment, I bared my crimson fangs and opened my jaw.

"——'Thunderclap'——"

The lightning that I had summoned and expelled, the same lightning that was raging across the entire continent, became a 'breath' and repelled Sylberthal's darkness, shaking both the temple and the palace.

With that as a signal, Sylbertha's and my attendants moved simultaneously.

Kiiiikikiki...

The surroundings instantly froze, and a portion of the rotting table set and the terrace crumbled into dust, while in the middle of it all was a silver-haired maid demon with wolf ears and a long tail, Neige. Nia, who had sprouted twisted black goat horns, slashed at her and neutralised the freezing air with her \[Absorption\] ability.

"I won't let you interfere with Lady Yurushia."

"Do as you please. If you can."

Nia frowned as she swung her golden sword, but Neige's expressionless, cold beauty remained unyielding.

Nia's Golden Magic Sword and Neige's Ice Claws clashed, and neither of them flinched at the impact that shook the castle. With terrifying speed, they swung their blades at each other again.

Gakiin!!!

"I don't like you."

"The feeling is mutual."

Leyon, the golden-haired maid demon who had instantly hit it off with Tina, another golden-haired maid, began a serious fistfight without any defense, their true demonic natures laid bare.

Gangan gangan gangan gangan!!!

A deafening roar and vibration echoed as they pounded each other like giant hammers striking rock. Their fists collided with each other's faces, sending them both reeling back. Then, Tina's hair, which had transformed into countless snakes, attacked Leyon's throat.

Leyon, with a displeased expression, instantly bit through the snakes with her silver fangs and retaliated with countless blades of golden hair. Tina, her eyes bloodshot, turned all the blades to stone.

"How cheeky."

Nui, whose dark skin was wrapped in a swarm of pitch-black, dust-like insects, was attacked by a transparent beast that tore through the black cloud.

"Hmm..."

Nui glanced up and saw the white-haired maid girl, Fannie, with a cheerful smile.

"Hey hey, play with me!"

"Oh, I'd like that."

With a smile, Fannie's face hardened into a rigid "clwon" mask, and the black dust squirmed, covering Nui's dark skin and concealing every part of her face except her eyes.

"Ahaha!"

The invisible beast's fangs tore the flesh off Nui's arm—

"Kyah!"

The black cloud touched Fannie like a swarm of insects, and the flesh on her shoulder flew off.

"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!"

"Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!"

The two of them tore at each other, laughing wildly.

""…………""

Noah, the butler demon with twisted black goat horns, and Etincelle, with her flowing, luxurious red hair, faced each other from a distance, exchanging thin smiles.

Neither of them moved. But it wasn't as if they were doing nothing. As proof, a sound like something bursting rang out between the two several times, and each time, the space around them warped.

"Could you please move aside?"

"A gentleman wouldn't be so hasty."

Etincelle smiled gently, displaying the composure of an older woman.

Noah noticed several Arch Demons, on par with Rose, approaching from the depths of the palace. Sensing this, Geas and Onza went to intercept them. Both were accustomed to fighting strong opponents, but he doubted they could withstand twice as many enemies of the same class for long.

"Open, \[Lost——"

Noah raised the key to the heavens, about to summon his subordinate demons from the \[Lost Eden\]—

Dan!

The door that appeared shattered explosively as soon as Etincelle stamped her foot.

"That won't do. My apologies."

"——Let there be piercing light, Holy Bow——"

At my voice, hundreds of arrows of light floated around Sylberthal, and the arrows of the Holy Bow that were fired all at once were absorbed into Sylberthal's spreading black hair and disappeared.

"Oh, oh, how beautiful."

Sylberthal easily deflected the full-powered Holy Bow without moving an inch from her spot, and looked around with a delighted expression.

"You all, get out of the way. I'm going to play with Yurushia."

"Yes, Lady Sylberthal!"

The four maids who had been fighting my servants until then all responded to her in a cheerful voice.

"I shall guide you."

"You..."

Etincelle lightly touched Noah's shoulder with her fingertip, easily and instantly leaping over the barrier he had put up, and they both vanished somewhere as if they were disappearing into mist.

"Then, I'll take you."

Clad in writhing black dust, like a crawling insect, Nui gathered behind Fannie, who had teleported into the air to avoid it, and grabbed her arms from behind.

"Let's go."

"Where—"

Before Fannie could finish her words, the two of them vanished into thin air.

Gangan gangan!!

Above them, the golden-haired maid demons were fighting each other. One of them, Leyon, suddenly charged in defenselessly, and while she was entangled in Tina's snakes, she stabbed Tina's body with her blade of hair in displeasure, and then, while continuing to punch, teleported away somewhere.

The last pair, Nia and Neige, continued their swordplay while moving at high speed.

Neige, with her extremely low temperature frost and wolf-like movements and claws, was toying with Nia. Nia was also parrying the frost and claws with her \[Absorption\] ability and her unusually sturdy golden magic sword, but she couldn't easily counterattack.

"This is a hassle"

"Same to you"

Neige, expressionless, parried Nia's half-hearted slash, and just for a moment—Nia's balance wavered. Neige transformed into an icy wolf and enveloped Nia in a blizzard-like whirlwind, trying to take her away.

"………"

Nia endured it with \[Absorption\], but then her eyebrows knitted into a pitiful frown, and she turned her eyes towards me for a moment.

Whoosh――

She threw something and then, leaving behind sparkling ice crystals, the two of them disappeared.

"——Snap."

"…………"

I caught the golden magic sword that Nia had thrown with one hand.

...I'm glad I didn't miss.

Besides the four of them, even Geas and Onza, who had been fighting the enemy Arch Demons in the depths of the castle, had disappeared. I know they're still alive, but...

"Now I can have fun at my own pace. You know, I heard from Rose that the troops you created were troublesome. I had them seal your \[Unique Subspace\]."

"Oh, is that so?"

A demon's unique subspace. My castle, \[Lost Eden\], with its army of thousands of special demons...

Well, it wasn't really 'mine', but Nia had diligently collected the magic power I was leaking using \[Absorption\], and Noah had created it arbitrarily using \[Release\], but still, it's not wrong to call it 'mine'.

To have Etincelle seal it so easily and then call it 'troublesome', that's really rich...

Even though I had specially crafted my attendants, making them as powerful as or even more powerful than most demons who had lived for hundreds of years, those four—especially the red-haired Etincelle and the silver-haired Neige—had already transcended the framework of \[Arch Demon\] and were approaching the level of me and that \[Demon Lord\]... Hi... Hira... Hiramaku Sanyaku.

But you really did it... Sylberthal. I never would have expected you to separate yourself from all your followers within the first few seconds of the match...

"What's that, you're laughing?"

"Yes, Sylberthal. ...I'm having fun."

An aura that shook the entire Holy Church emanated from my body, and the demonic spirit within me, which had become increasingly demonic since meeting Sylberthal, brought a smile to my face.

The \[Beast\] within me, coexisting with the \[Devil\], trembled with joy at the prospect of giving my all, and I let out a savage laugh.

"——'Holy Spear'——"

"Ooh!"

When I created several spears of light and fired them at Sylberthal, Sylberthal let out a voice filled with joy, ruffled the black hair spread out on the floor, enveloped all the anti-demon weapons, the \[Holy Spears\], and easily erased them.

"Ooh, Yurushia's power is truly beautiful. Just by releasing that power, the lowly humans below are already trembling. I shall use my 'Unique Subspace' here."

"‘Holy Bow’!"

Feeling a sense of danger, I jumped into the air and rained down thousands of arrows of light from my \[Holy Bow\], but Sylberthal raised one hand as if to block the attack and muttered quietly.

"Open——\[Hellgate\]——"

Infinitely spreading jet black hair―

Sylberthal's wavy black hair spread out as if to cover the entire world.

When I came to my senses, the bright sky of the Holy Church was filled with dark thunderclouds, and the world seemed to stretch out endlessly, like dull waves, like a swarm of wriggling poisonous insects, like the sea on a moonless night.

Just the two of us in the world...

Sylberthal, standing in the black sea.

And me, flying in the sky with golden wings...

"Welcome, Yurushia. This is my unique subspace—\[Hellgate\]."

Without responding, I took the Golden Magic Sword that Nia had given me and raised it in one hand, slashing it sideways to brush aside the remnants of Sylberthal's voice.

'Nya'
