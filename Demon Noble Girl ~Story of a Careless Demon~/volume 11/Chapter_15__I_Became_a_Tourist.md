# Chapter 15: I Became a Tourist

I finally arrived at the Sylber Kingdom, but I was told that I couldn't meet Queen Sylberthal yet.

Eh...? What's up with that? They invited me to the church, and then they won't meet me?

Apparently, it's because of some scheming by the ministers who want to show that they're superior to the Holy Kingdom. But it seems that the Queen actually only comes out of the temple in the depths of the castle once every six months or so.

What's going on? Is she just lazy?

Actually, even to my senses, I feel a strange presence, but I can't sense the presence of the Queen, a \[Demon Lord\]. I, and Rinne too, suppress our demonic aura and blend in with people, but if there's actually a high-ranking demon, I should be able to sense it somehow... hmm.

One possibility is that the Queen is usually in the demon world and appears when needed. But there are usually signs in the material world when passing through a gate, so it's difficult to go unnoticed.

Another possibility is that the Queen is currently not in this country. Then where is she usually?

Or, could she be in a situation where she can't exert her power for some reason? But even so, inviting me would be almost suicidal.

I really don't know what she's planning...

If I force my way into the temple, there's a high probability that it's a trap, and it would be difficult to send someone to scout, since there are probably other high-ranking demons besides Rose.

Oh well.

Let's just do whatever we want.

"Princess Yurushia, are you ready?"

The day after I arrived in the Church, a welcome celebration for me was held.

The next day after arriving last night? Normally, it would be opened after two or three days of rest, right? As the seamstresses of the Church, who were being intimidated by Tina and Fannie, were tearfully arranging my silver dress with the Church's thin cloth, Rose, who had already changed clothes, came in with a cat-like expression.

Come to think of it, Rose went back first to report to the Queen... So that means she met the Queen?

It would be difficult to force Rose to tell me anything about the Holy Church. Besides, Rose's face seemed somewhat stiff, and I somehow felt that it was the Queen's fault.

This time, I will enter as a guest, escorted by the first prince, Gino. After having Tina and Fannie check my dress, when it was time, I went to the waiting room with Rose's guidance, and I could faintly hear the music of the venue in the room. Gino and Axel were already waiting there, drinking tea in their formal attire.

When I appeared, Gino slowly stood up and narrowed his eyes at me.

"As expected of Princess Yurushia, you are beautiful. The cloth of the Holy Church suits you very well."

"Well, thank you, Gino."

"Hmph"

Axel, who was sitting a little further away, snorted at us. ... You two really don't get along.

When I think about it, I remembered the birthday party I had when I was 5 years old, where I had invited almost all the nobles. I was so nervous that I accidentally exerted my intimidation in all directions, but I won't make the same mistake as I did then. I'm growing up too.

Even if my opponents are the nobles of an enemy country, I've had enough experience to be able to smile gracefully and parry their attacks.

And so, it was time to enter, and after Axel and Rose, who both seemed reluctant, I entered, led by Gino.

Thousands of invited guests jumped into my field of vision along with the sound of the orchestra and the light from the opened door. I responded with a smile to the malicious gazes that were full of contempt, ridicule, and judgment.

... Ah, everyone looks so delicious.

At that moment, the air in the venue froze instantly.

... Did I do it again?

The moment I saw them, they all looked like braised pork, so my smile must have been quite wonderful.

Braised pork... it's so delicious. Amidst the silence that made even the orchestra forget their work, I found only one young lady with a terrified face and gave her a gentle smile as best I could, and for some reason, she fainted on the spot, and after that, many people began to collapse as if they had anemia, and the venue was in great confusion for a while. I'm sure I'm not to blame.

Well, I did do something bad to Gino. Gino, who is too ordinary, was supposed to escort the princess of the Holy Kingdom to show his presence to the nobles, but no one was looking at him.

... Just for smiling. That's cruel.

That was the feeling of welcome celebration, but I was able to engrave my impression on the people of the Church at a traumatic level. ... I'm glad no one had a heart attack.

“It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness. I’m Stella, and I’ve been assigned to be your attendant and guide from today onward!”

The next day, as I was drinking a mixed juice in the guest room of the reception hall, a young girl came to greet me.

“Oh... you’re the one from the party...”

"I, it seems I've shown you something unsightly..."

It’s not the first time, is it? She wiped the sweat from her brow, looking embarrassed. She’s the girl who fainted first at yesterday’s party.

I had assumed she was a noble's daughter, but her gestures and tone of voice seemed rather military. Perhaps she's a caretaker and guard. She seems like a normal human, so... maybe I could ask her for various favors.

“Stella-sama? I’ll be ‘asking’ you a lot from now on.”

“Please, just call me Stella!”

“Then, please call me Yurushia.”

“Y-yes, Princess Yurushia!”

Staring directly into Stella’s eyes, I touched her cheek as if to envelop her with my magic, and Stella’s face turned noticeably red.

I was trying to remove the Queen’s influence with my magic, but what’s with this reaction...?

Afterwards, when Stella asked me if there was anything I wanted to do, I asked her if I could see the life of the common people, and I was able to tour the city.

I had Noah, Fannie, and Geas stay behind (and investigate) with young Mark, and I, along with Nia, Tina, and Onza, got into a carriage with Stella.

“Your Highness Yurushia, is that a stuffed toy golem?”

“Something like that..”

As Stella's eyes lit up at the adorable moving rabbit stuffed toy, Onza was wagging his finger from Nia's lap as if to say, "Don’t fall for me, girl”.

Even so... As I thought when I first came, the cityscape looks different from the Holy Kingdom. Unlike the Holy Kingdom, which uses Western-style stone and brick, the Holy Church capital, which uses a lot of wood, has many low buildings and warm colors that look somehow soft. I thought that was why the impression was different, but...

“Stella. Where is the church?”

“Church... a religious facility?”

There are no churches, which are common in any region of the Holy Kingdom. According to what I heard, in this country, which worships the Queen as a god, there are no general churches, and the temples that worship the Queen are located a little distance from residential areas.

Being in a forest or woods with nature reminds me of a shrine. Although the architecture was certainly in the Oriental style, the temple I was guided to somehow had a similar atmosphere to the Earth’s shrines.

... Maybe there are still some demonic remnants.

When I sent a signal to Nia with a quick glance, she nodded with a confident grin. However, she immediately tilted her head with a question mark over her head, so I gave her a forehead flick for the time being.

“Princess Yurushia, you can draw an ‘omikuji’ here (TN: pulling a fortune from a lottery). Would you like to try?”

“Sure.”

An omikuji... So they exist. As an experiment, I paid a large copper coin and drew one, and I was given a piece of paper.

"\[Fortune: Wild card. Romance: The one you are waiting for is still there.\]" (TN: unpredictable but probably lucky future, with her potential love interest still out there but hesitant to commit)

...I don't understand what that means.

"Wow, Princess Yurushia, that's amazing! It's the first time I've seen that."

This was my first time seeing it too. I don't know what Stella is so excited about, but the knight guards who came with Stella are surprised, so it must be 'amazing'.

"Tina... you try it too."

"Yes, ma'am."

"\[Fortune: Intuition. Financial luck: Wait for your Pythagoras.\]" (TN: she should trust her instincts and wait for a logical solution to her problem, probably a thin-armor joke)

"Wow, maid-san, what a shame."

... What's a shame? I'm lost.

Tina, who had been staring intently at the fortune slip, approached me quietly and whispered in my ear.

"Master. The Sylber Kingdom seems to be a country that cannot be underestimated. Please be careful."

"...I understand."

Next, let's go see the market.

We had seen fruits and vegetables in other countries along the way, so we decided to go and see what was available in this coastal country, with our guide taking us around a seafood market.

It seems that nobles from other countries are rare, so the people in the market and the shoppers follow us curiously. At first, probably because of the Church's propaganda, I received some hostile glances, but I calmed them down with my smile, so I guess it was okay.

The market is lined with fresh fish that look as if they are still alive. Even with freezing magic, I have never seen so many in the Holy Kingdom, which is far from the sea, so it is quite a spectacular sight.

"G-give me some salt water..."

"…………"

Among them, a creature about four meters long that looked like a dugong was lined up with the fish, and for some reason, it asked for salt water in human language. I turned to the old man at the market, who enthusiastically explained to me what it was.

"That one's meat is tasteless, so it's just for decoration. Are you going to buy it?"

No, if it's for decoration, put it in a tank.

While enjoying such an exotic sightseeing experience, my impression after looking around was that the people living here are ordinary humans and have nothing to do with demons.

Do common people have less aversion to the Holy Kingdom than nobles? Maybe young people don't care so much.

While thinking about such things, Stella, who had heard something from a messenger, came towards me.

"Princess Yurushia, His Highness Gino has invited you to a dinner party with some noble young ladies. What do you say?"

So the first prince has made a move. Shall I join the preliminary battle?
