# Chapter 6: The Magnificent Everyday Life of a Demon God (1)

A region densely populated with small countries. To put it simply, it's an area that stretches south of the Holy Kingdom. But in reality, it's more like a gathering of noble families without a king, with each country smaller than even our Verusenia Dukedom. 

Usually, in such cases, large countries would absorb them or ambitious countries would invade others, but neither the Holy Kingdom of Tariterudo nor the agricultural nation of Sigres seems to feel the need to dominate such enclaves, and it seems that the small countries themselves, having many relatives through frequent intermarriages, have formed a united front against the larger nations. 

Even so, because they are human, there are some minor disputes between countries, and there may be young kings with ambitions, but for some reason, it never escalates into war. 

Well, the root of it is probably the national character of the southerners. Basically, as long as you go to the mountains or the sea, there is plenty of food, so they don't starve and are relatively carefree. 

And... I can see the shadow of the Holy Church. 

This group of nations is some distance away from the southernmost Sylber Kingdom, so it might be troublesome to control them, but maybe the Queen considers this region as a 'pasture' that doesn't need tending. 

A pasture of humans with special powers—special souls. 

Since choosing the next generation of royalty only within the Holy Church can be a matter of luck, they probably find children with special talents from orphans around here and secure them for the Holy Church. Even those who don't have much power will be used as soldiers, I think.

 And probably... they're also used as ingredients for those chimeras.

'Gau' 

"Master, the next town has been sighted." 

"Okay. Have Nia go ahead and book an inn."

A few days after leaving that village, we arrived at the town of a new country, passing through several small countries. The name of the country is... I don't remember the name because there are too many. 

Since all the countries make their fortunes through trade, the borders are basically unregulated, but... 

"Hey, hey, wait! Stop that carriage!" 

For some reason, we were stopped by the gatekeeper at the border. Noah got out of the carriage, and I exchanged glances with Tina and Fannie who were inside. 

"I wonder what happened... Hmm?" 

Noah, Tina, and Fannie were in the carriage. Nia, as a guard knight, is riding a horse alone, and the other carriage is being driven by Rose and Mark in turns. 

This carriage was supposed to be driven by Noah, Tina, and Fannie in turn. But all three of them were inside the carriage. So? 

"Gatekeeper, how can I help you?"

"Well, I mean... why is the driver the cub?"

'Gau' 

"..." 

Come to think of it, since the power of the two stuffed animals has grown, I had one of them watch over Rose, but it turns out that Geas was driving the carriage... 

A teddy bear driving a large carriage... That's an amazing gatekeeper. It's so surreal that I'd hesitate to stop them if I saw it.

But it's cute, so it's fine. 

"But it's cute, so it's fine." 

Hmm? As soon as I thought my inner voice had leaked out, I heard a girl's voice from outside the carriage. 

Wondering what it was, I looked out the small window of the carriage and saw a cute blonde girl around 15 or 16 years old saying that to the gatekeeper.

"Oh my, it's the Hero! You've returned!"

"Haha, I'm back!"

A hero? That girl? She was certainly wearing beautiful armor and had a sword, but I never thought such a delicate girl could be a hero.

Upon closer inspection, there was a wild-looking warrior carrying an axe, a sturdy knight with a large shield and one-handed sword, a tall, calm-looking mage wearing glasses, and a cute boy as a priest... it definitely matched the members Mark had told me about.

What is this sense of déjà vu?... They're the kinds of people who would fit right in as student council members in a school game popular with young ladies.

"But it's really cute. I wonder where this magic tool came from? Ah!"

The hero approached with a light, bouncy step, and when she spotted Noah, her eyes lit up.

"Hey, hey, you there, boyfriend. Is this teddy bear yours? Clara really likes it. Can you give it to me?"

Clara, the hero, with an upward glance and a lovely smile, made an incredibly bold request.

"I'm sorry, but that's a valuable companion of ours, so I can't give it to you."

Noah smiled gently and politely declined, his expression unchanged.

"Eeeeeh, why not? Clara asked you to do it." 

"Wait, Clara."

The knight, one of her companions, stopped Clara's continued begging with a gentle smile. As expected of a knight, there are some decent people among them.

"Hey, you there, the butler boy. I'll buy that stuffed animal from you. No need to worry about the change, just keep it."

I take back what I said. The stupid knight, who was only good-looking, took out a gold coin from his pocket, flicked it with his finger, and threw it at Noah. One gold coin... even if it were a magic tool, a self-sufficient one would cost at least dozens of times that amount, right?

But Noah didn't even look at the thrown gold coin, and he simply stepped sideways a fraction, causing the missed coin to bounce once on the road and roll away, where a group of street children immediately swarmed and ran off with it. So full of life.

"Well then, since I've declined, we'll be on our way." 

"W-wait!" 

"Hold on a minute!"

The wild-looking young man who looked like a warrior called out to Noah as he was about to leave.

"Hey, hey, Clara said she wants it, didn't she? I don't know where you're from, but you must know the name of the hero, Clara, right?" 

"Unfortunately, I don't." 

"You bastard..."

With a mocking smile, Noah simply shook his head, and the warrior's face turned ashen. He suddenly, with blinding speed, hurled the dagger at his waist.   
  
 Neither ordinary people nor the gatekeepers would know what he did. With that level of skill, I bet he could even assassinate someone in the street.

Grab.  

"..." 

"What!?"

The one who caught it was the rabbit who had somehow ended up on Noah's shoulder - Onza ...I'm really curious how he managed to grab it with those round hands.

Onza jumped down from Noah's shoulder, wagged his finger (paw?) as if to say 'Don't do that, kid,' and with a snap of his wrist(?) he threw the dagger somewhere.

You're so cool, Onza.

Clang!  

"Eeeeek!"

The thrown dagger pierced the ground two centimeters from Mark's face, who had been hiding from the heroes, and he let out a shriek.

"Oh, it's Mark! What are you doing out here on your own?"

Clara, noticing Mark for the first time, called out to him.

"I, I..."

Before Mark could say anything, Clara's companions glared at him, silencing him. Ah, I see. So he was being harassed by his fellow party members.

"Clara, he abandoned us. He's a traitor." 

"I, I didn't run away!"

Mark cried out in a voice on the verge of tears at the mage's words.   
  
 That's right. He was probably just unable to make a living. I don't know for sure which of them is telling the truth, but no one could blame me for not wanting to trust these heroes.

"Mark, come back... We need you, someone who started as a commoner like me..."

With a solemn expression, Clara looked at Mark, and his resolve began to waver. 

"Clara... I, I..." 

"It's just that, when we're camping, slaves can't cook, so it's a waste to buy portable food for everyone, and it's a lot of work to buy a new cooking slave." 

"I've already been hired by a young lady! I'm not going back!"

Wow, you overcame the temptation, young Mark. But a hero who was once a commoner? Even Noel was a refugee, not just a commoner, so I can't understand how they can treat other commoners so poorly.

"No way! Mark, you said you would support me. You said my hair was beautiful, didn't you? If you come back, I'll let you see it up close as a special treat. Anyway, you probably won't get paid much for being hired, right? I'll let you off for one gold coin as a special deal!"

For some reason, Clara was offering to pay Mark, and as if she was very confident, she ran her fingers through her silky blonde hair, which she had carefully groomed, while the shota priest stood next to her to support her.

"That's right! Clara's blonde hair is the prettiest! Anyway, your young lady probably isn't anything special, right?"

"Oh, what's going on here?"

I intervened because my servants were about to cause a disturbance.   
  
 I called out from inside the carriage, and slowly got off. 

"Is there something you need from my servant?"

Taking off my wide-brimmed hat, my golden hair sparkled in the sunlight, and as I smiled in my full-fledged duchess mode, Clara and her companions opened their mouths wide, and Clara's face, as she was touching her blonde hair, twitched violently.

"Now, shall we hear your story?"
