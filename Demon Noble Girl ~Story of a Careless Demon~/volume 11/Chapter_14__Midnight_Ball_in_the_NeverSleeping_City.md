# Chapter 14: Midnight Ball in the Never-Night City

The Sylber Holy Church, a great nation boasting the largest military power in the southern continent with a total population of 4 million, is characterized by its open plains to the north and the sea protecting its southern side. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this country is that the chosen Queen is worshiped as a goddess by the people.

The goddess of fertility. The goddess of war. The goddess of beauty and art. The goddess of commerce. The dragon god. There are many gods worshiped in the world, but in the Holy Church, the Queen, a living god, is the only god they worship.

However, this is just a story of the church heard in distant lands. It's the kind of information sought after by those who are wary of the church, but the most surprising thing that visitors who actually visit the church learn is that there is 'no night' in the Sylber Kingdom.

Well, to say that there is 'no night' is not entirely accurate and is more of an exaggeration. Those who hear it might imagine a red-light district where people and lights never cease, even at midnight. But in the church, thanks to the blessings of the Queen, or perhaps due to the faith of the people, the time of night is unusually short.

Even when it's time for children to sleep and the sun has set, the sky remains bright, and even at midnight, the sky shines as pale as before dawn.

This phenomenon is only seen within the territory of the Sylber Kingdom, and it is more pronounced closer to the capital. The white, elegant bird-like castle where the Queen resides always shines and is called the 'Never-Night Castle'.

Because the church is in the south, the temperature is high. In this continent where spirits are abundant, the temperature difference between seasons is small, but in the church, where the days are long, the temperature is naturally higher than in other countries, and sensitive people can feel it even from inside a carriage when they enter the church's territory.

However, if the temperature is high because it faces the sea, the humidity would also be high and it would be uncomfortable to spend time there, but thanks to the Queen's blessing, the humidity in the church is low, and people wear light clothing. It has become fashionable for women who cared about their appearance to layer several sheer fabrics.

Tonight as well, beautiful noblewomen were wearing flower-like dresses layered with thin fabrics, enjoying conversation at the 'Night of Lights' ball in the Never-Night Castle, Veil.

Hundreds of upper and middle-class nobles of the church gathered in the huge party hall, and including their attendants, the number easily exceeded 2,000\. In addition, tables and food and drinks were set up in the courtyard that continued from the hall, and under the bright night sky, lower-class nobles and wealthy people gathered and were engaged in gossip.

"Did you hear? Apparently the princess came without any proper guards. She only had a few attendants."

"Even if you call her a princess, she's the daughter of a prince who married into a ducal family, right? Isn't she not considered very important?"

"Well, her country has a history of using princesses as a diplomatic face. Even though she has the right to succession, she's probably a person who wouldn't be missed by the royal family if she disappeared."

"Misogyny is really troublesome for country people."

"That's why she hasn't even been allowed an audience with Her Majesty yet. It would be troublesome if she were to think that her country and the church are equals."

"Perhaps she's imitating His Highness Axel by having few guards. Without knowing why His Highness, known for his martial prowess, doesn't need many guards, country people are like this."

"If that's the case, then the rumors seem questionable."

"I heard the same thing. It's said that she is a saint who has been proficient in sacred magic since she was young and can manipulate magic on par with a bishop, but even if it's to boost her reputation, it's too much of an exaggeration."

"I heard that she defeated the Daemon King along with the hero. There's no way a girl of only ten or so could defeat a Daemon King."

"If I recall correctly, she disappeared for two years during that battle... I'm sure she probably ran away and they made up a good story about it."

"She's the princess of a lowly country that doesn't worship the Queen but rather an unseen existence as a god. I wonder how much of the rumors about her beauty are true."

"Fufu. It's customary to depict portraits beautifully. Let us expose the true nature of this country princess ourselves."

"Fuhaha, that sounds like fun."

Tonight's ball was held to celebrate the visit of Princess Yurushia La Von Verusenia, the fifth successor to the throne of the central continent's great nation, the Taliterudo Holy Kingdom, and a renowned Saint of the Holy Kingdom, as a goodwill ambassador.

But it was only in name, and as the rumors in the venue suggested, there was a deep rift between the Holy Kingdom of Taliterudo and the Sylber Kingdom.

Although both were great nations with long histories, the people of the church, who worshiped a living god in a monotheistic religion, were very hostile to the Holy Kingdom, which was called the highest religious nation on this continent while worshiping an invisible god.

Conversely, the Holy Kingdom, which allowed the belief in the gods of mythology without distinction, did not recognize the living god, but because it was polytheistic, it had no particular attachment to the religions of other countries and did not treat the church as an enemy, which led to the church unilaterally viewing them as enemies.

Perhaps it was jealousy, in a way. Although it was a similar religious nation, the Holy Kingdom was known by others as the "real thing"--

Recently, especially among young commoners, there's been a growing trend of admiring the Holy Kingdom, a country with a central continental culture. However, the older nobles of the Church, wanting to show themselves as superior to the Holy Kingdom, continued to make belittling remarks about the Holy Kingdom's princess at the party.

"What are they talking about?"

In a corner of such a venue, a girl wearing a church-style dress sipped a sweet fruit wine made by soaking fruit in a strong liquor unique to the south, and sighed, pushing her dark red hair, which had fallen on her cheek, behind her ear.

That girl - Stella, while consciously hostile to the Holy Kingdom, did not despise the Holy Kingdom like the old nobles who arbitrarily stopped the Queen's audience with the goodwill ambassador just to show their superiority. She was still young.

She had heard that the great Queen had wanted to verify the princess of that Holy Kingdom by sending a member of the royal family to study abroad. Stella was one of the members of the first prince Gino's secret intelligence organization, and due to her abilities, she had been ordered to assess Yurushia within the venue.

Stella was one of the children whose soul power had been drawn out by the Queen, but unlike those who were chosen to be royalty or heroes, she was a third-class ability user with relatively weak powers. Stella had the ability to sense the level of threat from a target based on their natural behavior and demeanor.

If she sensed a certain level of threat from Yurushia, Stella would be tasked with investigating the cause of the threat as one of her caretakers.

She had also obtained some testimony from a noble who had defected from the Holy Kingdom in the past. The testimony of Belrose, the defected noble, who had used drugs until he became a wreck, was also credible.

But even so, from Stella's perspective, who did not despise the Holy Kingdom, what Yurushia had done seemed far too absurd.

Without blatantly insulting and mocking her like the nobles in the venue, Stella also had a smile on her face, intending to expose Yurushia's true colors.

The venue buzzed with excitement as the entrance of the princes of the royal family and Princess Yurushia, the goodwill ambassador, was announced.

The large door at the top of the stairs at the back of the venue opened, and the second prince Axel and the first princess Rose, escorted by him, appeared, and cheers spilled out from the venue at the sight of the beautiful couple.

There had been another first princess before, but she had been erased from existence from the beginning because she did not meet the Queen's expectations. Since princes and princesses were originally adopted with the premise of benefiting the church, it was not uncommon for them to suddenly disappear.

Rose, who had become the new first princess, had not been as noticeable as the previous princess, but it was rumored that she had become very beautiful, perhaps due to the responsibilities of being the first princess. And Axel, known for his bravery, was also very popular among knights and young ladies, and compared to these two, the princesses of other countries seemed pitiable. However,

"...Is she tired?"

Having returned from a long journey and attending such an event the next day, Rose looked very tired to Stella's eyes.

Although Rose had not been very noticeable before, Stella had felt a greater threat from Rose since then than from the previous first princess. Although she did not say it out loud, as she was thinking about why Rose was so tired, the entrance of the first prince and the princess of the Holy Kingdom was announced next.

“...” 

Stella involuntarily gasped, the nobles' eyes widened, and the gentle coming from the orchestra tapered off.

The princess of the Holy Kingdom, escorted by the first prince, Gino.

With her golden thread-like hair tied up in a lustrous ponytail, a Holy Kingdom-style white dress that looked like spun platinum, and a thin Church-style cloth wrapped around her like a shawl, she looked like a fairy of light.

She was said to be almost 14 years old, but her cold and delicate beauty, as perfect as a doll, and her flower-like smile exuded a charm that was out of place for her age, making even the women feel their hearts race.

Her elegant demeanor, from her fingertips to her toes, captivated even the old nobles who had been mocking her, and both men and women were so captivated by her divinely created beauty that they didn't even notice the first prince beside her, his mouth twisting slightly.

"…………"

Among them, Stella, while similarly captivated, was sweating profusely and trembling with fear.

What was this...? Is she really a creature of this world? The last time Stella had felt such a threat was when she met the Queen and had her power drawn out.

Just looking at her made her body tremble... If the Queen's fear was like a sharp blade slowly piercing her heart, then the fear of Yurushia felt like being devoured alive by a hungry beast.

As Stella was unable to move while simply looking at her, Yurushia, who had been smiling gently like a white lily, suddenly turned her eyes towards her, and the poisonous nature of her lovely flower-like smile made Stella realize that she could no longer escape.
