# Comprehensive Combat Power List

The strength of 【Demons】 and 【Spirits】, which exist in the spiritual
world, is almost entirely determined by the amount of magical essence
they can wield.

Magic power equals strength, and its quantity increases or decreases
power, stamina, durability, and speed. Therefore, the calculation
formula for the combat power of spiritual life forms is simple:

\[Magic Power\] + \[Individual Special Ability\] = \[Total Combat
Power\]

This alone represents all of strength, and if the material world's
vessel is destroyed, as long as the magic power remains enough to
maintain 'existence' or 'sense of self', it will be reconstructed in the
spiritual world according to the situation, but in most cases, it will
be reborn as a lowest-level existence with only its sense of self
remaining.

Conversely, if it does not have a vessel in the material world, it
cannot be defeated until its magic power is exhausted, but if it dies in
that state, it will be reconstructed as a weak existence without an
sense of self.

As an exception, in battles between spiritual life forms, since they
erode each other's existence, the result is almost always the latter.

The calculation formula for 【Beings】 and 【Semi-Material Beings】,
inhabitants of the material world, is more complex because they possess
and depend on physical bodies.

\[Vitality ÷ 10\] + \[Strength\] + \[Endurance\] + \[Agility\] = \[A\]

\[Dexterity\] x \[Combat Skill Level\] = \[B\]

〈\[A\] x \[Magic Power ÷ 50\] (minimum value 1.2)〉 x \[B ÷ 10 (minimum
value 1)\] = \[Total Combat Power\]

In the case of ordinary people without magic power or combat skills,
only \[A\] + \[Dexterity\] becomes the total combat power.

The average total combat power of ordinary humans is about 40, but it is
estimated to be even lower for modern-day salaried workers and some
nobles.

Skill levels are classified from \[1\] to \[10\].

Skill level 1: Amateur (only minimal knowledge)

Skill level 5: Master (the highest level that ordinary people can reach)

Skill level 10: Mythical (capable of feats that can only be considered
divine techniques)
