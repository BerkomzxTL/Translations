# Chapter 5: Our Journey Has Begun (3)

"Are you really sure about this? I hope you won't get fired again..."

"Y-yeah, I think so."

The innkeeper and young Mark exchanged worried glances. It was understandable that the landlady, as a parent, would feel uneasy about her son suddenly being hired by a young girl who had just appeared.

The food Mark made had a special enhancing effect—honestly, for a demon, it was more like a subtle status boost, but since demons perceive that as "deliciousness," I immediately wanted to headhunt him. However, considering he had just been kicked out of the hero's party, I thought it would be difficult. But when he saw Nia and Fannie, two beautiful girls of his age, he nodded immediately.

"Here's five gold coins as your monthly salary. And here are three large gold coins as a signing bonus."

In front of the two, still looking uneasy, I placed one shiny large gold coin on the table after another. Then, taking out one more, I slid it smoothly towards the innkeeper. She had been following the movement of each large gold coin with wide eyes, and with trembling hands she picked up the first one and carefully placed it in her purse.

"Mark, follow the young lady even if kills you!" 

"Mom..."

Most things in the world can be settled like this (evil).

A gold coin is about 100,000 yen in Earth's currency, and a large gold coin is ten times that.

In the Holy Kingdom, a young couple would need about three large gold coins a year. Even a family of four could live comfortably with four to five large gold coins, but since this is a rural area, two or three large gold coins would be enough for a family to live normally.

The gold coins of the Holy Kingdom of Tariterudo in particular have a high exchange rate, so they are welcome in every country. Trust is important.

Although they're not vassal states, small countries nearby, where the value of currency tends to fluctuate, seem to be gradually shifting their circulating currency to Tariterudo gold coins.

We've saved up quite a lot of donations from our members, so we've invested in Mylene for consumption purposes and opened a shop in the best location in the royal capital, but for some reason, our money keeps increasing.

This is also thanks to our employees who have unlimited flat-rate usage and work themselves to the bone (sometimes literally to ashes), but money is meaningless if you don't spend it.

People might say, "You should donate the surplus to an orphanage, you idiot," but as a member of the royal family, I'd rather spend money on providing a stable supply of durable and cheap pots than sealing up broken pots and making people use them.

As usual, the story has gone off on a tangent, but I've successfully acquired young Mark as a cook.

That said, since this is a carefree journey full of demons except for Axel's side, it might be a hassle -- or rather, it might feel suffocating at times, so let's gradually brainwash -- no, educate -- them into our common sense.

"I have a lot of questions I want to ask you. Is that okay?"

"Yes..."

We borrowed a corner of the dining room and held what was essentially an interrogation under the guise of an interview. Mark was sitting directly opposite me, but after facing me for about a second, he looked away.

...What’s different between me and Nia and the others? For the sake of my mental health, let's just say that I’m 'scary because I’m the boss.'

"Can you tell me about you and the hero's party?"

"Well..."

It turned out that Mark was born with a special ability to enhance food with magical properties. He was discovered by a church in the city and after returning to this village, a hero's party that had heard about it came to recruit him.

According to Noah's calculations, the boost from that food is about a 5% increase in ability for ordinary humans, but since it's an additive increase rather than a percentage increase, I think the effect would be negligible for a true hero.

Mark was with the hero's party for about half a year. At first, the heroes weren't that strong either, so they were happy with the ability increase. However, as the hero's party got stronger, it became a bit of a problem.

The effect would decrease over time, but it would accumulate if you ate it every day for three meals. But as the hero's party got stronger, they would fight stronger enemies. Fighting strong enemies is tiring, and since they earn a lot, they want to stay in luxury inns. And since they're staying in luxury inns, they want to drink delicious sake and eat luxurious food. But then the cumulative effect would disappear, making it insignificant.

So, he was gradually treated as a nuisance, and although Mark was only about as strong as a villager, he was kicked out because they didn't want to pay him a share.

"How much were you getting paid?" 

"At first, it was about two silver coins per adventure, and towards the end, it was about five small silver coins..." 

"That's cheap!"

In this world, there aren't many monsters (wild animals are dangerous), but instead, mercenary groups do the work of adventurers. Even a small-scale mercenary group would require about five gold coins for a single hire.

It's not a beginner-friendly world where you can defeat goblins in one night and two days and be like, "Yay!" It's a dangerous world where you have to use swords and spears to kill rhinos that are charging at you at 100 kilometers per hour.

Even in Mr. Bear's mercenary group, it took 20 people to defeat a single stray hippopotamus. Maybe the hero's party had dozens of members?

"Well, there was the hero, a warrior, a knight, a mage, a priest, and me..." 

"That's not enough!"

That's more than a typical hero's party in the Holy Kingdom, and although they supposedly had slaves as porters, his share was too small even after deducting expenses for those people.

And by the way, slavery still exists in the south of here. There's no such thing in the Holy Kingdom or the neighboring countries.

"I've heard rumors that the church gathers orphans and the ones left behind become slaves."

"Hmm..."

The church... In the Holy Kingdom, those children would simply become novice priests, but is that normal around here?

Come to think of it, Mark was recognized for his abilities at a church, wasn't he? If the church was testing the abilities of the children they gathered...

""....""

I glanced at Rose, who turned away.

In the Sylber Kingdom, children with latent abilities, like Axel and Estelle, were welcomed into the royal family.

Maybe that church is under the influence of the Sylber Kingdom. And maybe the hero who so easily got information about Mark from that church is also connected to them?

I don't know what they're planning, , but I'll have to look into it a bit.

"...Hey, don't think of anything weird. I have to take you to the Queen." 

"I'm not thinking anything weird."

Rose warned me like that from the side. I don't know what kind of contract she made with the Queen of Sylber, but she's quite the workaholic.

"Mark, we're leaving tomorrow, so get ready. You just need your belongings, but if you don't know what to do, ask Noah—the butler over there." 

"Y-yes! I just came back, so I can leave my luggage as it is, but it's quite sudden. Where are we going?" 

"To the hero's party you were in." 

"EEHHHH?!"

Too noisy. Ok, let's make Tina Mark's mentor.

I think Tina and Fannie have the necessary seasonings and utensils for cooking in their subspace storage, but I wanted to buy new ones that can be purchased in this village, so Tina grabbed Mark by the scruff of his neck and drag him away. ...I hope this doesn't open a new door for young Mark.

The innkeeper, who I had given a part of the contract money (bribe) to earlier, smiled at me and offered me tea, even though she saw her son being treated like that.

As evening approached, customers began to arrive at the restaurant, so the innkeepr introduced us to some people and gave us some information about the hero and the church. We discovered that the church was in a town along the main road.

The next day we left as planned. Since we weren't originally here for a vacation or sightseeing, there was no problem.

We planned to leave in the morning and arrive at the next town late in the afternoon, but we had to have a proper lunch. Even though I don't really need it as a demon, I had Mark cook a deer (?) that Geas had caught (and half-eaten) as a test of his skills.

"...Is this really worth hiring someone to cook?"

Axel, who for some reason had joined us, mumbled while biting into a skewer of deer meat (pink), causing young Mark to flinch.

Well, since Mark basically only cooks rural dishes like green onion pancakes, people with refined palates probably don't find it particularly delicious. But,

"That" 

"...."

In the direction I was pointing, Axel fell silent as he saw Rose, the bear, and the rabbit madly devouring skewers.

If even Rose, a typical demon, finds it delicious, it could be useful in various ways.

Come to think of it, I have a feeling that Mark's true calling is not as a 'hero's companion' but as something like a 'priest of an evil god'.

Anyway, I've now got a pretty good grasp of Mark's abilities, so now it's just the hero and the church.

I need to find out exactly what they're up to.

...For my own amusement and harassment!

"You're definitely thinking weird things, aren't you!"
