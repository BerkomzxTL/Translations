# Chapter 10: The Magnificent Everyday Life of a Demon God (5)

"Yurushia... what are you up to?!"

Rose burst into the high-class inn's room with a bang. Seeing that she had retained enough sense not to destroy the door, despite her anger, I glanced at her.

"What is it, Rose? That's rude."

"I told you not to meddle! And yet..."

"Oh, what are you talking about? It seems there have been some incidents in town, but could it be that they're related to the Holy Church?"

"Th, this..."

I hadn't heard that the Sylber Holy Church was secretly controlling the 'church,' and Rose hadn't told me either. Well, Rose probably guessed that I had a vague idea, but she had avoided saying it herself to prevent things from getting worse.

Rose, being an Arch Demon who had lived for a hundred years, seemed to know the common sense and tactics of the material world to some extent, but she didn't seem to think that I, who had been invited by the Queen, would do something like picking a fight with the church right from the start.

...I didn't expect things to get this serious either.

As a result of provoking the hero Clara in order to cause a rift between her and the church, what happened? Let's go through a reenactment based on the testimony.

\*

"That's... that's right!"

"""Clara!"""

Clara, who had been swindled out of the profits she was rightfully entitled to by a woman who was both terrifyingly beautiful and incredibly wealthy, with the grace of a royal noble, yet surprisingly cute when she smiled, and who was, unfortunately, still in her early teens, managed to glean some useful information from this gaudy golden-haired woman. Cutting short their pointless conversation, she dashed off toward her destination.

They say that the world changes depending on how you look at it, but for the hero Clara, this is the "truth" she saw.

That woman had said, "If you're recognized as a hero, it's only natural to receive the highest level of support from them."

Honestly, I didn't want to believe that woman's words, but when she said it was common in a place like the Holy Kingdom of Tariterudo—which Clara described as 'super-urban' compared to here—then I thought it was okay to believe her.

"Clara, what are you doing?"

The young warrior, who had managed to catch up, grabbed Clara's shoulder and stopped her, and Clara frowned and turned around.

"Don't stop me, I'm going to get money from the church!"

"Is that what the young lady said earlier? It would certainly be easier if we could get support from the church."

The young knight who had caught up with them spoke up, wondering if this level of assistance would be enough. From behind, the low-stamina mage and priest finally caught up and appeared, and the mage joined in the conversation while catching his breath.

"Are you going to do the same thing as that girl and make Mark earn money? How can you get the church to provide such a large amount of funds?"

"Y, yes!"

As the son of a church bishop, the priest thought it would be difficult to provide enough funds to buy up all the potions used in a country, even if it could be said that he was receiving support from "somewhere".

In reality, the amount could be paid if the bishop released the money he had embezzled, but the church cannot afford to waste money, considering personnel and maintenance costs.

"I don't want to. I'm not going to rely on such a traitor."

At Clara's statement, which was so different from her earlier words about 'saving Mark who had been deceived,' the priest was relieved, but his smile froze at Clara's next words.

"Because from now on, all of our operating funds will be provided by the church!"

"...What?"

Clara explained to her companions with a smug look on her face.

She argued that the reason they were doing nothing but the church's work, which was not a good deal for them, was because the church had endorsed Clara as a hero.

Since their work had increased the authority of the church, it was only natural that the church should cover all of their operating expenses. In fact, in the Holy Kingdom, which was a bigger city than this one, the heroes received the highest quality equipment and assistance from their certification source, so it would be strange if they didn't do the same.

Therefore, Clara told her companions that it was only natural for the church to cover Clara's debts and that they should also pay for Clara's living expenses and shopping money.

"Oh, that's amazing. That makes sense if that's how they do things in the big city."

"That means we can use the highest quality potions as much as we want. That's great."

"Right, right?"

The warrior and mage agreed, and Clara smiled proudly.

""…………""

The knight beside her furrowed his brow slightly, and the priest's face turned pale.

Clara's living expenses currently amounted to a large gold coin per week. If the church were to be extorted for financial support on a regular basis, it would amount to over fifty large gold coins in a year, and if they were to demand the best equipment from a larger country that was not available in the surrounding area, the church could go bankrupt.

Most of the current living expenses were being used by Clara. She didn't seem to be able to restrain herself if she had money at her disposal.

 There is a saying that even imperfections are beautiful, but the priest, who had found Clara's girlish love of shopping and her selfishness endearing, was rapidly losing his romantic feelings for her and his gaze at her turned cold, as if he were looking at something unknown.

"I guess it can't be helped..."

The young knight thought it was natural for commoner merchants to give money, and that it was only natural that they should give money because it was thanks to him that the merchants were able to earn money without worry, but he was reluctant to take money from the church, which existed thanks to donations from the common people.

However, at the same time, he thought that he would need some support, and he thought that if Clara and the others went to the church and learned the reality, they would become more obedient and work hard. But—

"A hero should be ashamed to beg for money."

"What!"

Clara stood up from her seat at the bishop's words.

The bishop flatly refused Clara's request for financial support. At first, the young knight had proposed a certain amount of money that would not be too burdensome, but the bishop had heard the details from his son, the priest, a short time ago, and was afraid that if he gave even a copper coin, it would set a precedent and he would be begged for more money repeatedly.

When the priest consulted him, the bishop should have asked the Holy Church for instructions. But if he was told by the Holy Church to provide half of the funds to the hero, his own profit would disappear.

"If you continue to work for the church, I will give you a little extra. Now, please leave."

Before anyone knew it, priest knights with maces were surrounding Clara and the others, and when they saw the young priest on that side, their companions opened their eyes wide.

"Hey, what are you doing?!"

"I'm originally a member of the church. It's only natural for me to be on this side."

The young priest said coldly, and the mage gritted his teeth.

"How cruel! You all hate me!? If you're a hero, it's only natural to receive money, so the church's money is mine too!"

Clara suddenly shouted, releasing her light magic and blowing away the knight guards.

While it was understandable that Clara felt that heroes should be supported, the premise was different from that of a \[Hero of the Holy Kingdom\] who was recognized by both the state religion and the state in a religious country. However, even taking those feelings into account, Clara's words were far too violent.

"Haha, let's do it, Clara! Leave these guys to me..."

CLANG!

"...What the hell are you doing?"

"I'm a knight. I can't just stand by and watch a crime being committed."

"Perfect! I've hated your smug face from the start!"

"What a coincidence. Your vulgar personality is annoying."

The warrior, who had parried the knight's sword, roared and exchanged blows.

"Y-you guys, stop... ugh!"

The mage, who had been blown away by a sudden magical shock wave to the wall, glared at the priest.

"What are you doing!?"

"Behave yourself. God will forgive you if you don't side with Clara."

"...Ho ho"

A blue vein popped up on the mage's forehead at the words of the boy who had looked up to him like a brother just yesterday. Although the mage didn't think Clara was right, he was angry at the boy's words.

"A group of fraudsters who cheat money from the weak by pretending to be godly dare to be so arrogant."

"...Take that back, you mere magician!"

The warrior and the knight. The mage and the priest. The hero party, who had once been comrades, split into two and began to kill each other.

Even though they were originally comrades, they were 'rivals who did not recognize each other,' having been attracted to the former, more pure Clara. Even though they had appeared friendly on the surface, they had always been thinking about eliminating their rivals, just like with Mark, and even when that reason no longer existed, the hostility that had accumulated in the depths of their hearts remained.

They were of the "hero class" who were attracted to the hero.

Their fighting power was more than five times that of ordinary knights and soldiers, and their battle destroyed the walls of the church and caused massive damage to the city.

And Clara, the cause of it all, had no eyes for them. Taking advantage of the confusion, she broke into the depths of the church and stole the money and valuables that the bishop had hoarded.

Perhaps because she had a strong desire for self-display, Clara 'confessed' to the citizens that the church had hoarded a large amount of money and escaped, causing the church to be viewed with distrust.

As a result, Clara, the hero who had committed robbery, was wanted in all the surrounding countries.

Her companions were also arrested and imprisoned for aiding and abetting a crime, as well as for damaging property and injuring citizens by destroying the city. (The knight surrendered; only the warrior escaped.)

The fact that the church had recognized them as heroes, and had been hoarding money, led to them being viewed with suspicion, and the authority of the church was significantly weakened after the bishop was arrested on charges of tax evasion and other offences.

\*

Well, that's about how it went, but you guys are too much at odds with each other... Even though I planned it myself, the success rate of the operation is an amazing 700%. I feel bad for Rose, who is furious, but I didn't intend to go this far either.

But to be honest, it would be embarrassing to say so, so I put on a faint smile and said, "As planned."

"Rose. Your role is to guide me to the Holy Church, isn't it? Could you stop making strange accusations?"

"You..."

All the whites and blacks of Rose's eyes turned completely black, her skin turned a murky black and scaly, and her clothes were frayed as if worn out by the aura that overflowed from her entire body.

As I purified Rose's demonic aura with holy magic, I also turned my eyes from white to black and my pupils to a bright red, and manifested a single crimson nail as if gathering magic in my right index finger.

If you do anything more, I'll erase you from existence...

"...Hmph, don't get carried away. Remember that when we arrive at the Holy Church."

For a moment, fear flickered across Rose's face, and after returning to her senses, she returned to her human form and spat out a few words before leaving the room.

"Master..."

"It's okay, Tina. Leave her be. She still seems to have some sense not to release her presence. Rather... Fannie, could you go and check on Clara again? I want you to see if she's doing anything strange."

"Yes, can I go right away?"

"Sure, but... ah, don't kill her, okay?"

"Understood."

Her silvery hair swayed slightly before disappearing in an instant.

I had Fannie go and check on them, as it seemed like they were both running away... but I think I should have given Fannie more detailed instructions.

That child... She's the cruellest among all my attendants.
