# Chapter 12: I've Become a Doll

By fusing with a suitable 'vessel,' demons can extend their activities in the material world, which also leads to an increase in their power.

For high-ranking demons like Arch Demons, possessing a human as a vessel requires a compatible, tainted soul. Even when summoned to the material world, it's not easy for them to find a suitable vessel.

Conversely, lower-ranking demons have more options as they can use inanimate objects with strong emotional attachments as vessels, in addition to living beings. However, due to their low spiritual power, fewer individuals are compatible for fusion with lower-ranking demons.

In the case of Onza, the vessel was created using materials with strong emotional attachments from the creator, allowing for easy fusion. Not only that, but by obtaining a high-ranking vessel, Onza was born as a \[Greater Demon\] from the beginning.

Geas, on the other hand, reincarnated as an entity surpassing an \[Arch Demon\] from the start. However, due to rapid growth, he was unstable and could not obtain a vessel. In the process of degenerating into a \[Greater Demon\], he managed to absorb substances from the atmosphere and was fortunate enough to be able to use them as a medium.

Demonic Possession Experiment Subjects, found in the research facilities of the Holy Church.   
  
 They were demons who underwent repeated experiments involving possession of various animals, in an attempt to efficiently provide physical bodies for \[Lower Demons\], which were easy to summon but couldn't stay in the mortal world for long and had unstable abilities, turning them into combat power in the material world.

Even if the lower-ranking demons could possess a being, they would lose their demonic selves and be disposed of as mere lower-level monsters. Even those lower-ranking demons who retained a degree of self would end up with deformed appearances, and they couldn't obtain the planned combat power or abilities.

Nevertheless, they were not disposed of because they retained their self, allowing for a certain degree of reuse or use in other experiments. For this reason, the experiment subjects were fused with various living organisms and inanimate objects, causing them to lose their demonic powers.

Demonic Possession Experiment Subjects. Approximately 200 of them.

They were temporarily stored in the headquarters of the Yurushia Army, \[Lost Eden\], by Fannie, but unlike the Four Attendants who served as executives and department heads, Geas and Onza, who were Arch Demons but had only recently been promoted from section chiefs to acting deputy section chiefs, did not have the key to \[Lost Eden\], and the two were holding repeated meetings in the deep forest with 200 experiment subjects.

'Gau'

'...(nod)'

The rabbit plushie, which had been pouring the cheap sake recommended by the teddy bear into a chipped teacup, took a gulp and exhaled, pretending to breathe.

Around them, the experiment subjects were greedily devouring a mountain of dried seaweed.

The experiment subjects were useless to Yurushia as demons. As executives, the Four Attendants had considered disposing of them and sending them back to the demon world, but the two, who still retained their human parts, felt sorry that they had finally evolved into \[Lower Demons\] and come out into the material world, only to have to start all over again.

'Gau'

'... (hops)'

Geas stood up, and as Onza moved his hand, the experiment subjects swarmed after the two as they walked.

What the two were trying to do was to restore the demonic powers of the experiment subjects. They had discussed various things, but unlike when they were humanized, their intelligence was now infantilized. The conclusion reached by these two old men who were like infants was simple and crude: they should just eat souls and their power would return.

'Gau'

Just eat. Under Geas' overly general order, the experiment subjects began to eat the trees and grass around them.

'(trembling)'

Onza tried to explain that eating such things would only be unpleasant, but the \[Lower Demons\], who originally had low intelligence, didn't understand and devoured a corner of the forest, and then began to move on in search of food. Since they could only shake their heads silently, it was difficult to understand.

And what lay ahead of them was-

"Hahaha. Today's a big haul!"

"Great job, boss! There's dozens of gold coins here!"

"Because the town is in chaos right now, we could attack on the highway without any problems!"

"Hahaha, that's why I told yo... gyaa!?"

A mountain hut where bandits seemed to be loitering was crushed by the wave of experiment subjects, and only a few foundations of the building remained after they passed.

In the same vein, the experiment subjects led by the two targeted the lairs of thieves in several places. They were lucky that there were no villages inhabited by ordinary people on their route, but perhaps their demonic sense of smell had led them to where there were more filthy souls.

As they zigzagged through the deep forest, devouring the trees, Geas, Onza, and the others came across an old castle-like building.

'Gau?'

'...'

A small, old castle. Or maybe an old fortress. Before this region became as stable as it is now, there were many noble territories that couldn't even be called countries, and they were constantly fighting each other like in the Warring States period. And in the meantime, most of them were absorbed by other small countries or destroyed.

Perhaps this was also a relic of that bygone era. But Geas and Onza, who didn't know such things, casually led the experiment subjects into the castle, which emitted an ominous aura, perhaps due to the grudges of those who had been killed.

A doll fell into the hallway as they entered the building. Decades... perhaps even a century old, the bisque doll's surface was cracked, and it rose to its feet, its eyes wide open, as it let out a hoarse, distorted cry.

"Get out of here..."

The voice stopped halfway, and seeing the teddy bear and rabbit plushie in front of it, its jaw clattered to the floor.

It was probably a residual thought that had become an evil spirit and inhabited the doll. The evil spirit, which had threatened to expel anyone who entered its castle, trembled violently at the sight of the teddy bear drooling sloppily, and the rabbit plushie stepped forward towards the bisque doll.

\*

In the same place, at the same time, two girls faced each other in the hall at the center of the old castle.

Was it because the previous owner of the castle was a collector? The place was scattered with a large number of dilapidated and broken dolls, and with its ruined atmosphere, it was a favorite spot of that girl—Rose.

Rose, an Arch Demon under the Queen of the Sylber Kingdom, excelled more as a researcher in experiments and studies than in combat, and she had several bases in this southern small nation group.

"Was that okay, Lady Rose?"

"Yes, it was fine. With this, those fools will realize how stupid they were."

"And then, um..."

"Fufu, I understand, Clara. After this is over, I shall recognize you as a hero of the Sylber Kingdom and guarantee you a comfortable life."

"Yay!"

The other girl was Clara, a hero who had run away after causing a commotion in the town.

Originally, Rose, as one of the researchers, had been involved in the modification of Clara under the Queen's orders. Rose had been careful not to get involved with Clara while hiding her true identity, but sensing that Yurushia had reached out to the new church affiliated with the Holy Church, she sneaked out under the radar and contacted Clara, planning to trick Yurushia into a trap instead.

It was not easy to sneak past the watchful gazes of the Arch Demons Noah and Fannie, but for Rose, who had over a hundred years of experience, it was difficult but not impossible. Perhaps because their direct attacks were sealed by Yurushia's 'Divine Word,' those Arch Demons, who had absolute loyalty to Yurushia, had slight gaps due to that trust.

"Well then, would you like to go in?"

"Yes!"

Receiving the evidence of the Church's involvement that Clara had obtained from the research facility, Rose led Clara to a glass capsule.

Yurushia seemed to have wanted to tarnish Clara's credibility and the reputation of the church that had chosen her by having Clara carry this evidence, and to expose the Church's conspiracy to the world, but Clara, who had already made a deal with Rose, had brought the collected evidence directly to her.

"Once you wake up, you will be the strongest hero."

"Yes!"

Watching as the glass container filled with liquid and Clara's golden hair swayed like waves, Rose spat out, "You incompetent bastard"

Even though Rose had known in advance, she had failed to destroy all the evidence.

She had replaced the evidence in important bases with innocuous things beforehand so as not to arouse suspicion, but Clara's failure to kill all the human researchers left witnesses behind, which is likely why the small nations have become distrustful of the Holy Church.

It was not enough to denounce the Church, and in any case, no matter how much the small nation group made a fuss, the great Sylber Kingdom would not be shaken.

Although she thought there was no problem, Rose was displeased that the plan had not proceeded unhindered. She couldn't understand why Fannie, a demon, had kept the researchers alive. She wondered if Noah had planned it all along, anticipating such an outcome, but she shook her head, thinking that was impossible.

"...Well, it doesn't matter. My priority is this."

Rose turned her eyes to Clara swaying in the tank.

Rose had been concerned by Clara's unstable behavior for some time, and had asked the Queen if she could conduct further experiments on her, but the Queen refused.

But now that Clara's reputation had fallen so low, the Queen would probably not say no.

Clara had the ability of a hero class, but she did not possess the power of a hero.

Rose had also been unable to find the factors that made a hero, but the Queen had given Rose something and ordered her to create an "artificial hero" with it.

It was a special magic stone that contained a sealed spirit. The sealed spirit had been processed to a primitive state where its self had been completely destroyed, but Rose had succeeded in giving it a light attribute and implanted it in Clara, giving her the power of a hero.

The power of an artificial hero could not be transplanted to all hero classes, and most of them died from rejection. Clara, the only successful case, was also very mentally unstable.

 "Now then..."   
  
 When Rose placed a red magic stone into the container where Clara was sleeping, it instantly melted and disappeared, as if canceling out the attributes of Clara's spirit. When Rose confirmed this, she then dropped in a black magic stone, which was gradually absorbed, as if eroding Clara.

The black magic stone was a lower-level demon with its self destroyed, just like a spirit. The rank of the demon or spirit that could be used varied depending on the material, but Clara should be able to withstand a few more.

Rose lined up three black magic stones and four white magic stones containing spirits on the table so they were ready for immediate use.

"Fufu... do your best, Clara. If this experiment is successful, you will be reborn as the strongest chimera while retaining your human self."

Chimeras, created by combining low-level demons and spirits, could draw out abilities close to those of an Arch Demon, but their performance varied depending on the materials, and the biggest drawback was that their self was erased and they could not accept complex commands.

Rose considered this to be the output of the human soul and the balance between the demon and the spirit, and if she could calculate Clara's aptitude value, who had a higher output of the soul as an artificial hero, she thought she could begin mass production of higher-level chimeras.

And above all else――

"That woman... don't think you can get away with making a fool of me."

Rose could not forgive Yurushia, who, though a high-ranking demon, had only been born a dozen or so years ago, for mocking her who had existed for over a hundred years.

"The strongest chimera made from a hero. Fufu... I wonder if you can deal with her while hiding your true identity? Fufufu. Besides, it's ridiculous to have two stuffed animals watching over me. It's a piece of cake for me to deceive such things."

—

""...""

With so many dolls scattered around, Rose had completely failed to notice the stuffed bear and rabbit toys staring up at her feet..

Onza could completely erase his presence, and Geas could change the amount of magical power within him at will.

"Now, I'll just have to observe for a while. Fufu... I'm looking forward to it."

After observing Clara, Rose thought she should return before being suspected, and cheerfully teleported to the city where Yurushia was.

'...' 

'Gau'

Onza and Geas casually grabbed the magic stones left on the table and chewed them up.

For them, as high-ranking demons, the demons and spirits were just food. Seeing the two of them like that, the two hundred dolls left in the hall got up and swarmed around the tank where Clara was sleeping.

＊＊＊

"…How did this happen?"

'Gau Gau'

'...'

When I called out to them, Geas and Onza tilted their heads together. It's cute, but they're old men on the inside, so that's beside the point.

"Onza convinced them, apparently."

As I tilted my head in confusion, Fannie translated for me.

Apparently, a large number of dolls possessed by evil spirits had been found, so Onza had convinced them to merge with the demons of the experiment subjects and become their vessels, and they had taken them from Rose, the owner of the dolls.

"Hmm... I'm sorry, Rose. For taking them."

"...Y-yes."

Rose, who looked like she had just lost her soul, was surrounded by a large number of bisque dolls laughing 'kekeke' and pulling at her skirt and tights.

There were about 100 bisque dolls, and the remaining 100 were animal plushies, playing together with Geas. Should I just ignore the dolphin plushie that's flopping around on the floor?

"By the way, I feel like I've seen that bisque doll somewhere before..."

"That's Clara."

Over on side, playing with a gorilla plushie like a toddler, is a blonde doll that looks just like Clara. How did that happen?

...Well, I guess I'll never understand what's going on in those people's minds.

And so, with 200 new demons under Geas and Onza, we finally reached the Sylber Kingdom a few weeks later.
