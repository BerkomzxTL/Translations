# Chapter 13: Sylber Kingdom

"We've entered the Sylber Kingdom."

"...Eh?"

Rose, dressed in a knight's uniform similar to the one she wore when we first met due to the fact that the Church was now close, muttered something like that.

Rose is in the same carriage as me. She was an enemy, but after showing off her power as an \[Arch Demon\], she was made to wear a maid outfit by Tina and was used as an errand girl, but even so, she was allowed to change clothes because she was still the second princess of the Sylber Holy Church Kingdom.

Even though Rose said that, the scenery I could see from the window remained unchanged, and there was nothing that could serve as a landmark. If anything, it got a little hotter? But since the Sylber Kingdom is at the southernmost tip of the continent, it's always pretty warm.

"How do you know we've entered the Kingdom?"

"Fufu, you'll find out soon... ow ow ow!"

'Gau'

The moment Rose answered my question with a sassy remark, Geas clamped down on her head. It's clear from Rose's panicked expression and the sound of ice being crushed in a mixer that it's not a gentle bite.

Geas and Onza became \[Arch Demons\] a few months ago, and at first they were watching over Rose together, but they caught up with Rose on our journey and must have eaten something extra when they brought back a large number of dolls the other day, as they already seem to have surpassed her.

When it came to having Rose ride in the same carriage, those two plushies were accompanying her as a kind of surveillance, but in addition to that, Tina was giving Rose a lovely smile after she mouthed off.

... A loose tongue leads to trouble.

As we continued in the seemingly cheerful carriage with the three girls and two stuffed animals, it gradually became hotter.

Well, since we are supernatural lifeforms, we don't sweat, but wondering about it anyway, Fannie, who was driving the carriage, opened the front window and gave me a very rough report saying, "I can see something!" What is it?

Then the sound of horses' hooves came from outside the carriage, and Axel's attendant called out.

"Princess Yurushia, the Church's welcome party is here!"

Hmm... Even though we've been traveling together for several months, it feels like I haven't seen Axel's group for a long time.

After a while, the carriage stopped, and Noah opened the door for me and escorted me out. About twenty knights in pitch-black armor were stationed in the middle of the road, each accompanied by a horse.

 As expected, there were few knights in plate armor, probably because it's the south. Most were wearing scale armor or chainmail, which seemed to have good ventilation.

In this world, since there is magic, it's surprisingly comfortable and doesn't get stuffy if you draw magic circles on your armor, but such armor is expensive, so I think people who wear plate armor must have a certain status.

"Oh, thank you for coming to welcome us!"

Axel, the second prince of the Sylber Kingdom... right? He got off the carriage next to me and greeted the welcoming party, and several upper-class nobles wearing plate armor stepped forward and knelt before me, ignoring Axel.

"You are Your Highness Princess Yurushia of the Taliterudo Holy Kingdom."

"...Yes."

With Nia by my side, I confirmed. Axel, who had been dumbfounded by being ignored, stepped forward with a sour look.

"What are you doing, you..."

"Axel, be quiet."

The voice came from a young man hiding in the shadows of the knights at the rear. As the knights, who had only confirmed that I was Yurushia, stepped back, he stepped forward in their place and gave a polite smile.

"Nice to meet you, Princess Yurushia. Welcome to Sylber. I am the First Prince, Gino."

"...Brother?"

Gino, the First Prince of the Sylber Kingdom.

I remember he was said to be inconspicuous, quiet, and plain compared to the Second Prince Axel and the First Princess Estelle.

Well, he's certainly plain compared to Axel, who is not at all princely, and Estelle, who is an incomprehensible princess. Or rather, he's an ordinary handsome prince with flowing blond hair and blue eyes.

Even so, since the Second Princess, who was said to be inconspicuous in the same way, was actually an \[Arch Demon\], there's a possibility that he's not normal, like Rose, but from what I can see he appears to be a normal human being.

Axel snorted in displeasure at the First Prince's appearance.

"Hmph, why are you here, brother? Shouldn't you just be quietly sucking up to the Queen?"

Rude.

"That's very disrespectful in front of Princess Yurushia, Axel. I've been ordered by Her Majesty the Queen to welcome the Princess, who is here as a goodwill envoy. It's best for incompetent people who can't do their jobs properly to stay out of the way."

They don't get along.

"Axel, return to the castle immediately. The Queen is waiting for you. Rose, you too."

When Gino called out, Rose, with a frown, got out of the carriage and bowed before Gino.

"I've returned, brother."

"There's no need for greetings. Return ahead of me."

"...Can I borrow your horse, Axel?"

"...Do as you please."

With a dismissive tone, Axel nodded slightly, and Rose glanced at me, gave a brief nod, and rode her horse in the direction we were heading.

I understand why Rose, a demon pretending to be human like me, would obey Gino's orders, but I feel like she's not doing a good job of 'acting'.

"I apologize, Princess Yurushia. Please forgive my poorly educated younger siblings. I will escort you to the castle."

"Yes, please, Prince Gino."

"...Hmph."

These guys don't get along... They're all adopted by the Queen, and are not related by blood. They're fighting for power, so it's only natural, but I wish they'd try to smooth things over a bit.

Axel returned to his carriage, and as if venting his frustration, it sped off, heading in the direction Rose had disappeared to. Gino sighed as he watched, but when he turned back to me he was back to his old smile.

The knights of the Church were on horseback, half leading the way and the other half positioned to guard the rear. Gino galloped alongside my carriage, and as we rode leisurely, I opened the carriage window and had a light chat with him.

"I have heard rumors of Your Highness Yurushia, the Saint of the Holy Kingdom, but you are even more beautiful in person."

"Prince Gino, you flatter me."

"Please, call me Gino. I'm not just saying this. The moment I saw you step out of the carriage, I felt like I had been struck by lightning. I couldn't speak for a moment."

...My appearance is not exactly popular with the general public.

"Gino...about your siblings..."

Ah, it seems Axel and Rose have caused you trouble. On behalf of the Holy Church, I apologize. If there has been any damage, please feel free to make a claim.

"Well..."

If you're going to say that, I'll make a claim equivalent to the national budget, but that's not what I'm concerned about right now. I'm more curious about the fact that Gino only talks about Axel and Rose.

"About Lady Estelle..."

"Estelle...? There is no such person in the Church."

"..."

There is no such person as Estelle in Sylber. I thought maybe the Queen had done something, but when I saw Gino's eyes as he declared that she wasn't there, I understood.

When she failed and Rose went out to retrieve her, it was as if Princess Estelle had never existed in the first place.

Hmm... so that's how it is. The Sylber Kingdom... sounds fun.

"Is this your first time in the south, Princess Yurushia? I imagine you must be surprised by the heat."

"Yes, indeed. But even though it's hot, it feels quite refreshing."

My smile grew deeper and I continued the pleasant conversation.

"It's not like that everywhere in the south. Since it's close to the sea, it's quite humid in other places besides the Church, but thanks to the power of the Queen, the Holy Church Kingdom is very comfortable to live in. It might have been a little cooler further north, but in terms of comfort, the Church is superior."

"Since there are many small countries, they can't use large amounts of magical power. And the churches that the people worship there have been creating strange things."

I lightly poked Gino about the new church.

"Strange beliefs are troublesome. If all countries worship Her Majesty the Queen, everyone would be happy. By the way, Princess Yurushia, do you know?"

"What is it, Gino?"

"I heard that after the church with that strange belief disappeared, a new cult with an even stranger doctrine, something like 'Ignite your heart...', took over the site and is gaining followers..."

"Oh..."

At Gino's voice, which suddenly sounded genuinely eerie, as if his forced smile had disappeared, I instinctively averted my gaze. Tina also quietly looked away.

"Tina..."

"..."

"More importantly, Princess Yurushia, have you noticed anything?"

"What is it?"

"It's been quite a long journey today..."

I tilted my head slightly and looked back on the day. I think we've already had lunch...

"Tina, what time is it?"

"It's nine o'clock at night."

When I glanced at Gino, he was smiling warmly under the sun, or what seemed like the sun.

"Now, we're almost there."

Hearing Gino's words, I poked my head out of the window. In the distance, I could see a bright white castle shining in the sunlight, even though it was night.

"That is Veil, the Never-Night Castle."
