# Chapter 17: Saint of the Holy Church

Gino, the First Prince of the Sylber Kingdom, like the other princes and princesses, was chosen by the Queen to become royalty because of his powers.   
  
Gino was born into a minor baron family in a rural part of the kingdom, the son of a concubine.

However, that didn't mean he was mistreated. His mother was originally the daughter of the legitimate wife's beloved foster sister, and though his memories were hazy, Gino remembered being cherished by his stepmother and half-siblings.

Those peaceful days ended when Gino was recognized as having potential and the Queen discovered his powers.

While Gino's abilities were more mundane compared to the First Princess Estelle's \[Charm\] and \[Physical Enhancement\] or the Second Prince Axel's \[Ability Analysis\] and \[Ability Theft\], they were considered effective in diplomacy for the new Queen's consort. Thus, Gino was chosen as the First Prince of the Sylber Kingdom.

There was a top-secret process called "settling the past" for those who became royalty.

One might wonder what kind of past there is to settle for a young child, but in the case of Estelle, the First Princess, for example, she was born in a poor village in a small foreign country.

If it were known that a princess and potential Queen was born in such a place, there would surely be nobles who would stir up trouble and try to undermine her, making it a weakness.

Therefore, before that could happen, the village where Estelle was born was erased from the map as soon as she was recognized.

The same went for Axel, and Gino's family, the minor baron family, was also erased from the history of the Sylber Kingdom.

Gino swore revenge on his stepmother, whom he barely saw even after becoming royalty - the Queen who had massacred his entire family and erased their very existence.

Although Gino's abilities were competent, his direct combat power was low. Depending on how he used them, he could fight better than an average knight, but he was far weaker than his younger siblings.

And above all, he couldn't let Axel know about his abilities. If Axel knew that Gino's abilities were useful, he would surely steal them using his own.

Therefore, Gino hid his abilities, using them to conceal himself and quietly waiting for the opportunity to strike.

Gino's abilities were \[Truth Judgment\] and \[Falsehood\]. With some limitations, Gino could discern lies, and his words were easily believed by others unless they were blatantly false.

Using this ability, Gino hid his own powers and was able to grasp the abilities of his younger siblings. The only exception was his youngest sister, the Second Princess Rose, whose abilities he couldn't grasp.

Rose was probably hiding her abilities as well. While she remained quiet in Estelle's shadow, she was called upon by the Queen more often than her other siblings, and she was seen adjusting relations with other countries both as a princess and as an individual.

Just when Gino was starting to get impatient for the decisive opportunity, there was a movement in the kingdom.

In this country, there was a culture of worshiping the Queen as a goddess, and therefore they had long been hostile to the Holy Kingdom of Taliterudo, which worshiped an unseen god.

However, this was only the case for old-fashioned people with conservative views, such as nobles and politicians, and for the always dissatisfied poor. Although they looked down on and harassed the Holy Kingdom, they had never officially declared war on them, as the successive Queens had not taken any action.

This changed a few years ago.

The daemons and the Daemon King who live in the northern lands of the continent had declared war on human society. The war was only expected to reach as far south as the central continent where the Holy Kingdom was located. The nobles of the southern kingdom, which included the Sylber Church, laughed indifferently, hoping that the Holy Kingdom would be destroyed in the process.

However, a \[Hero\], \[Saint\], and \[Holy Paladin\] were chosen from the Holy Kingdom, and they successfully defeated the daemon army and drove them back to the northern lands, declaring that neither side would invade the other's territory.

The biggest contributor was the \[Saint\], a princess only eleven years old at the time, who had converted even the Daemon King with her great love. It was said that even after the saintly princess went missing, the Daemon King faithfully kept his promise to her.

As soon as the saintly princess went missing, the Queen took action.   
  
She attempted to draw in the nobles of the Holy Kingdom, turning them against the royal family, and at the same time, sent special troops led by Rose to bring chaos to the Holy Kingdom.

The Queen's intentions were unclear. However, since she had ordered that the royal family and high-ranking nobles not be killed, Gino thought that she might be using it as a "trump card" against something.

However, that plan also ends in failure.  
  
When the so-called 'Saint' returned to the Holy Kingdom, she instantly rallied the nobles and suppressed the rebellion.

No matter how famous she was as a saint, how could a princess who had just returned gather such a diverse faction?   
  
Gino felt a strange sense of unease, similar to how the people of the Sylber Kingdom worshiped the Queen and how the people of the Holy Kingdom revered the princess as a goddess of the new world.

And since the Queen had sent Estelle, a candidate for Queen, as a student and even proposed a marriage between her and Axel, Gino realized that the Queen was trying to bring the princess of the Holy Kingdom into the Sylber Kingdom.

The princess of the Holy Kingdom must be incredibly powerful.   
  
That's probably why the Queen is so afraid of her.

If that's the case, then it's not the Sylber Church that should take her in, but me.

With that thought in mind, Gino decided to actively engage with the princess of the Holy Kingdom—Yurushia—to win her heart and make her the new Queen, a pawn to eliminate the current Queen.

Gino's ability ensured that Yurushia wouldn't doubt him. When Gino proposed to her, Yurushia showed a slight surprise, then bowed her head slightly, looking a little embarrassed.  
  
Gino felt his heart constrict as he felt the beautiful, sincere smile on her face, a smile without a hint of falsehood.

＊＊＊

"―'Let there be light'―"

As I chanted the holy magic, angels of light danced in the room where children were dying from incurable diseases, and the light disappeared, leaving behind feathers of light.

"...It doesn't hurt."

"I can move!"

"I can see..."

The children got out of bed and cried out in joy at their completely healed bodies.

"That's... impossible..."

"It's a miracle..."

"The Queen's... miracle..."

While the medical staff stood there in shock, some stunned, others fell to their knees exhausted, I smiled broadly at the children.

Today I'm being guided by Stella and am now visiting the medical facilities of the Holy Church.   
  
Thanks to Gino's "sincerity," I was given permission to enter most of the facilities in the country.

In the Holy Kingdom, each sect's church was responsible for medical care, but in this country—the Sylber Kingdom—religious facilities were simply places for people to worship the Queen, similar to religious facilities in modern Earth.

So, where do they do medical treatment?

When I asked Stella, she told me that there were clinics in various places where they used alchemic medicines made from herbs for treatment. They also use sacred magic, but unlike the Holy Kingdom where it's monopolized by the church, it's treated jsut as simple healing magic.

However, there are fewer people who can use holy magic than in the Holy Kingdom, and the technology is not as advanced.

Because of that, while it's easier to receive treatment for ordinary injuries and minor illnesses than in the Holy Kingdom, serious illnesses and physical defects are almost impossible to cure.

When I first came to visit, the people at the clinic looked down on me, as if to say, 'What does a religious-obsessed person from the Holy Kingdom know about medicine?' They then told me to try and do what I could, and took me to a crowded room where only those waiting to die were gathered.

Well, the results are as you can see.

"Now, now, your bodies are still weak, so let's make sure you eat properly and get your strength back."

"Yes!"   
  
The children must have gone through a lot of pain and suffering, as they clasped their hands together in front of me and tears welled up in their eyes.

I heard that the Queen could do something similar, but instead of healing everyone, she would perform a demonstration called the "Goddess' Miracle" by healing select subjects on a regular basis.

Well, it seems like I've just casually performed that "Goddess' Miracle".

"Stella, please guide me the next place."

"Y-Yes, of course!"

So, I continued to visit medical facilities in large cities and healed people wherever I went.

As I repeated this, the rumor changed from "A country bumpkin from the Holy Kingdom is doing something" to "The Holy Saint of the Holy Kingdom is healing people."

And then... here it comes.

"I believe you are Princess Yurushia of Taliterudo!"

An old man wearing a luxurious robe, probably an upper-class noble from this area, appeared with several knights and approached me at an open-air cafe on the main street.

"May I ask who's calling?"

"I am Count Cojou, the lord of this land! I would like to ask Your Highness to heal this servant of mine."

People like this also come.

While some people genuinely came seeking help, nobles like this would deliberately approach me in public places to make me look like a fraud or simply to belittle me.

The better off "patients" that such people bring are usually ones with incurable or serious illnesses and "on the verge of death," but in most cases, as in this case, they bring over patients who are already dead.

Of course, it doesn't look like a 'corpse' in the typical sense. It's more like they half-killed the person and then doused them in poison, so it's fresh, but there is no such thing as a \[Resurrection\] spell in holy magic.

If someone has been dead for less than 10 minutes, it's sometimes possible to revive them with a shock like that of a cardiac massage, but the body in front of me was clearly beyond that range.

"Well, well, what do you say, Your Highness? Or perhaps the rumors are false? Oops, excuse me for suggesting such a thing."

Count Cojou said with a sneer, making sure everyone around could hear him.

Even if I told him from the beginning that the person was dead, he would probably say that I had lied and let them die because I took too long.

"Yes, it's no problem."

I smiled and replied, and I could feel a quiet murmur from the onlookers.

Me too...I purposely choose places where there are a lot of people.

"―'Let there be light'―"

As I chanted, a phantom of golden wings appeared on my back for a moment, and all the astonished eyes of those present were fixed on me. And as the light scattered like fireworks...

"...U... ah..."

Groaning, Count Cojou's servant started to move, looking around curiously.

A moment of silence—and then the astonished voices of the onlookers roared like thunder.

"Impossible..."

Count Cojou muttered in astonishment, and when his eyes met mine, he turned red and pushed through the crowd to leave.

And the servant who had come back to life, with slightly greenish skin, nodded slightly at me and followed Count Cojou.

I never said anything about bringing him back to life as a human, did I?

As I continued doing this, with Gino, my collaborator, spreading rumors about me, people in the towns I visited started to welcome me with cheers, as if welcoming "Her Majesty the Queen."

"I guess it's about time."

"I believe so. Lord Gino has requested a meeting."

As I muttered to myself, Noah brought me a sealed letter on a silver tray.

Now then—

Queen? Aren't you starting to want to meet me now?
