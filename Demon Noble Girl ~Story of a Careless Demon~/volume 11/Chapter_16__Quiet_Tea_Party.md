# Chapter 16: Quiet Tea Party

"Your Highness Princess Yurushia, I've come to pick you up."

"Yes, thank you."

While sightseeing in the royal capital, I received an invitation to dinner from the First Prince, Gino. And what's more, it's with some of the young ladies of this country. It sounds like a real pain. I'm looking forward to it.

As if it had already been decided before I answered, I'm going to be taken to some mansion in a carriage that Gino had prepared, different from the one I came in.

Although it's called dinner, there's still quite a bit of time. In this country, the daylight hours are unusually long, so it's still bright like day, and still around snack time.

A meal, huh... It's been months since I've had a meal without offerings or soul seasoning. It's not like I need to eat human food, but as a noble, I have to eat at least some things I don't like, which is a hassle.

When we arrived at the mansion where the dinner was scheduled, the host, Gino, had not yet arrived, so until then, I was to have tea with the young ladies who were also planning to dine together.

A tea party with people I haven't even been introduced to... What is he thinking?

"And who are these young ladies?"

When I asked the middle-aged butler that as we were being guided, he gave a thin smile.

"Oh, are you unaware? It's quite rude to ask such a thing of a goodwill ambassador... excuse me, but it's especially cruel to ask such of a young princess."

As expected, the people at the top seem to be very hostile to the Holy Kingdom.

"The young ladies who are here are the candidates for Gino's marriage. All of them have remarkable powers."

What is the purpose of introducing me to Gino's fiancées? For now, I silenced Tina and Nia with my gaze as they were getting tense behind me, and I arrived at the tea room where the young ladies were waiting.

"""......"""

As soon as I entered the room, the three young ladies who had been chatting fell silent and turned their gazes to me.

Um... I think, according to this seating order, the one with red hair sitting at the head of the table and looking down on me with a haughty gaze is Eleanor, the Duchess's daughter, 18 years old.

The one with bluish-black hair on the right, who is frowning, is Carla, the Marquess's daughter, 17 years old.

The one on the left, who looks a little young and grinning at me, is Chloe, the Countess's daughter, 15 years old.

I don't remember the names of their houses.

Greetings differ from country to country, but at parties, the lower-ranking people don't greet the higher-ranking ones until they are spoken to. But at tea parties, people are always introduced, so the lower-ranking people greet the higher-ranking ones in response.

It seems to be the same here, and despite being the host who is welcoming a royal from another country, the three of them maintained their attitude of being superior and waited for me to greet them.

The butler from before urged me to greet them with his gaze.

The maids who were waiting in the room also looked down on me with their gazes, as if to tell me to start the greeting as I was from the lower-ranking Holy Kingdom.

Well, if I were a normal noble lady, I would probably be intimidated in such a situation with no one on my side.

So I simply walked forward, and while the suspicious young butler didn't move, I silently sat down in the chair that Nia had pulled out for me at the table where they were sitting.

...Standing up is tiring. If I keep my face expressionless, they will definitely be frightened, so when I smiled at them, they frowned, and the butlers and maids looked at me even more harshly.

Well, we're all being rude, so I won't say anything.

""""......""""

A heavy silence filled the room.

As I continued to stare at them with a faint smile, showing no signs of being flustered or anxious, Carla was the first to become uneasy, and in a small, trembling voice, she asked the maids behind her, "Tea..."

At her words, the maids swallowed hard and moved awkwardly, preparing teacups for the three of them and, as a formality, for me as well.

The strong-willed maid who had been glaring at me approached me, but for some reason, her hands were trembling as she poured the tea into the cup.

I didn't touch the tea. I simply stared straight ahead with a gentle smile, and Eleanor, who had moistened her lips with the tea, opened her mouth disdainfully.

"Nowadays, there are more and more country bumpkins who don't even know common sense. Don't you think so, Chloe?"

"Yes, indeed. We're putting up with her out of pity, but she doesn't seem to understand her place, does she, Carla?"

"Y-yes, that's right. Perhaps she's become conceited after being praised as a saint and a princess."

Carla, perhaps having regained her composure after being called out by the two of them, was now blatantly contemptuous.

"Oh, Carla, it's cruel of you to say such things. After all, she is a believer in a false god who does not worship Her Majesty, the Goddess."

"I'm sorry, Eleanor. I'm an honest person at heart."

"But it's true, isn't it? It's foolish to call oneself a saint without knowing the true God."

It seems they had decided to ignore me. While avoiding looking at me, they continued to belittle me.

At the root of this was their hostility towards the Holy Kingdom, but it also seemed to be related to religion.

I raised my hand and the three of them stopped talking. It was silent again, and everyone turned to me.

As soon as I lowered my hand, Tina stepped forward from the side, took the tea placed in front of me, a took sip with the spoon.

Although it is customary in aristocratic society to taste food for poison, no one would taste for poison in front of someone at a tea party they were invited to.

Eleanor frowned at this, Carla raised her eyebrows, and Chloe grinned gleefully.

Then, Tina quietly returned the teacup to the table.

"It's cheap."

"What did you say?!"

Carla stood up, knocking her chair back with a bang.

"You're being incredibly rude!"

Carla roared, unable to ignore this. Sighing loudly, Eleanor looked at me disdainfully. Chloe looked suspiciously back and forth between the cup and Tina, wondering if she had put something in it.

Ignoring the murderous gazes of the maids, Tina took out a beautiful heat-resistant glass and silver teacup from somewhere and poured a fragrant, deep red tea into it. The sweet, fruity aroma filled the room and I wordlessly took a sip.

"――――――!!"

Carla, who had been ignored by me, gritted her teeth, her face turning crimson, and stormed out of the room.

Following her, Eleanor slowly got up from her seat, clicked her tongue softly, and silently headed outside. Chloe hurriedly got up and turned to face me.

"Don't get too cocky. Gino would never be interested in someone like you."

With those words, Chloe, the last one, left the room, followed by the maids in a hurry. In the end, only the three of us and the middle-aged butler who had initially guided us remained.

"So, when will dinner be served? Sebastian?"

"Who's Sebastian!?"

Excuse me, excuse me. I just thought the middle-aged butler was probably Sebastian.

I won... Well, Tthere's no particular meaning to winning, but not taking part in a fight that was provoked is a sign of the decline of a woman. ...I'm so impatient.

As I was drinking tea alone in the empty room, Sebastian (not his real name) told me that Gino had arrived.

We had a one-on-one dinner. Apparently, those three ladies had gone home. They probably didn't have the guts to stay after being defeated so badly.

Gino smiled wryly at me during our one-on-one dinner.

The food in this country has a tropical flavor, with plenty of seafood, herbs, and spices. But well, no matter what was served, I couldn't really taste it, so for me, it was just plain, spicy clay. (Seriously)

I gave up after just one bite of everything. Thinking that maybe the talking manatee I saw at the seafood market would be more edible (soul-wise), Gino spoke to me.

"Princess Yurushia, what did you think of those three?"

"They're still... I guess."

Hm? Taste-wise? They taste more delicious than other nobles, but I think they need a little more aging to develop a richer flavor. I blurted out my honest opinion, and Gino nodded deeply.

Those three are apparently the next Queen candidates whose powers have been drawn out by the Queen. The reason why they haven't been made royalty is that their powers are biased towards the shamanistic side, and they were not raised as adopted children after their powers were discovered, but were born into the upper nobility.

"It's difficult for those three to become Queen. If that happens, I, as their fiancé, will also not be able to become king consort. I believe there was a proposal of marriage between Axel and you from our country..."

Ah, there was such a thing. I thought that story had fallen through because of Estelle's mischief.

Thinking about that, Gino looked at me seriously and whispered softly.

"Why don't you become my wife, overthrow the Queen, and become the new Queen?"
