# Chapter 10: Journey Through Hell (4)

We entered the hole where that "Mr. Hira something" was likely to be. The entrance was a tiny hole, like a prairie dog's burrow, but as we descended, it gradually widened, and when we landed on a flat floor, we found ourselves in a cave about three meters wide and long.

\[The Abyss\] shouldn't be completely dark because of the way it's imagined, but as we moved deeper, a sinister aura swirled with an eerie darkness.

"That's normal."

"That's normal..."

While a human would be terrified, for us, demons born and raised in the Demon World, it was as common as imagining a rural area and picturing a roadside produce stand.

I wonder if he's someone who judges things by appearances.

But in this day and age when people are so keen on individuality and all that, isn't it more amusing to see a socially awkward person who would never get into a romantic relationship in the first place copying the fashion they saw in a magazine when they started university, than someone who got kicked out of the team because of a love affair and still creates a harem?

When I think about it that way, I don't dislike this kind of overtly demonic sense of style.

"Let's go, Rose."

"What's wrong? You're suddenly so eager..."

On the flat walls of the passage, there were skull carvings that seemed to have been carved by believers.

There were flickering lights that looked like ghost fires here and there.

The flickering shadows seemed to let out moans of pain and resentment like ghosts.

"...Yurushia-sama, why are you smiling so happily..."

"Oh, is that so?"

Apparently, I was smiling, so I put my hand to my cheek.

It's so cute that he can do such a stereotypical thing without any shame.

He must be the kind of person who loves to eat alone in his private room.

However, as I smiled pleasantly and continued on, something changed.

"...The scent of roses?"

Instead of a faint rose scent, a strong floral scent, like a toilet air freshener, was wafting through the air.

What is this? Wasn't he a simple country boy? If he wanted to blend in, he could just dye his hair a little brown, but I felt a chill, as if he had dyed it a bright gold for no reason.

"......"

"Why are you suddenly so grumpy!?"

Apparently, my emotions were showing on my face, and Rose was scared.

No, no. I was momentarily mistaken and thought he was a good guy, but no matter how I think about it, "Mr. Hira something" is still the enemy.

I straightened myself up and continued deeper into the cave. As if understanding my determination, Rose, who was a bit of a cynic, followed behind me with a serious expression.

"………"

The intense fragrance made the surrounding magic appear as a vision, and it looked like the entire floor was covered in rose petals.

He must be somewhere up ahead. He's someone who scares off even the demonic Rose, frightens the hopeless souls of that settlement, and leads the devil worshipers, scheming something.

The end of the passage was faintly lit.

I peered cautiously into the slightly widened area, and there, a half-naked man wearing a stone mask and a flimsy loincloth was striking a strange pose among the roses, waiting for girls.

"!?"

"Ugh!?"

In that instant, I grabbed the nearest rock and slammed it into his head.

Bang, bang, bang!!!

"Gah, ugh, hi-gyauh!?"

I continued to slam the rock into his temple, the back of his head, and then the top of his head with all my might. When the rock shattered unable to withstand the pressure, he bloomed a magnificent flower of blood. I delivered a heel drop that sent him spinning forward, embedding him in the sunken ground, and then I threw all the nearby rocks into the hole.

"Bury him, bury him! Bury the pervert!"

"Eh...…"

Rose, who had been dumbfounded, came to her senses and started throwing rocks into the hole with me.

After a while, when the hole was completely filled with rocks, I wiped my forehead with a satisfied smile.

"The pervert is dead."

"…………"

Rose was silent with a complex expression that seemed to be a mix of disbelief and incomprehension.

"Well then, shall we go?"

"What did we come here for again...?"

Bang, bang, bang!!!

"Ugaaaaaaaaaah!!!"

In that moment, the pervert blew away the rocks that had been buried and resurfaced from the bottom of the hole.

"Tch, the pervert's tough..."

"Who's the pervert? You brat!"

The pervert became angry and enraged as my words hit the nail on the head.

I mean, he's half-naked, or rather he's almost completely naked, only wearing a loincloth, and even though he's all skinny, he has so much chest hair that it's impossible to make fun of, which is really disgusting.

"...Huh? You... somewhere..."

The pervert, who had been glaring at me, narrowed his eyes, which were peeking out from behind his half-split stone mask, and looked at me.

No, I don't know any perverts... I was thinking that when the pervert's eyes widened in surprise.

"...Y-you... Yurushia!!!"

"...Who?"

This pervert seems to know me. I looked at him suspiciously, and the pervert grinned slightly, though somewhat irritated.

"I wonder if you’d be able to say the same thing if you saw my bare face."

The pervert took off the half-broken stone mask, and his noble-looking, well-defined face was revealed, as if the wounds from being hit with the rock had already healed. ...This guy... could it be?

"Hirata-kun!?"

"Who's that!?"

That's right... I remembered. This guy is Hi.. Hira... Yes, this guy is the demon who used Geas to trap and extract tens of thousands of souls, but he was also one of the Seven Demon Lords who ruled over the Demon World.

I fought him as a fellow high-ranking demon, and although I was slightly weaker at the time, I managed to defeat him after a fierce battle that lasted half a year by a narrow margin.

Why didn't I remember until now...? I learned about demonic tactics, cunning, and how high-ranking demons fight from him.

But I just can’t help it... this guy's character impression is so faint that if I look away for a moment, even his face becomes blurry.

"Could it be that you're using a high-level demonic technique where you become so forgettable that you can act in secret...?"

"Don't say nonsense! You, Yurushia, I haven't forgotten what you did to me! I spent a hundred years cultivating a contract, and you snatched it away from me at the last minute, casually throwing away those precious souls into a dimensional rift, and during the battle, you suddenly started eating strange dried fish! Enough is enough!!!"

"It's been a long time. How's business? Are you doing well?"

"Can't you listen to what I'm saying!?"

For some reason, Hira something is getting angry again. He must be so irritated because he's been in this sunless place for so long.

"Want some wakame seaweed?"

"Why do you have food with you in this Abyss!? And where did that conversation even come from!?"

"Easy now."

To calm him down, I used my claws to carve a bowl out of a nearby rock and placed dried wakame on a rock table.

"Do you have any hot water? I can make some wakame tea."

"Of course not!!!"

Crash! Hira something knocked the bowl of wakame away with his bare hand.

So this is what today's easily angered young people are like... No, he's not young by age. It's like a salaryman who's over thirty but still dyes his hair blonde for no reason.

Apparently, he's determined to get revenge on me.

"So, what are you doing in a place like this? Making artificial roses and toilet air fresheners?"

"Who would do such a thing!? Ha... Let me tell you something good."

Hira something, having regained his composure a bit, looked down at me, who had been weakened and turned into a little girl, and sneered.

"The name of the next stock that will skyrocket?"

"What world are you talking about!? Listen carefully, and despair! Even someone like you should know. I am one of the oldest demon lords in the demon world, and I have made a contract with Lord Sylberthal. In return for my resurrection in the mortal world, I am tasked with selecting the most evil souls in this place and sending them to be her vanguard. As part of that contract, my body has regenerated to the point where I can move freely! How about it? Do you have the courage to take her on?"

"…………"

I glance at Rose, who quietly shook her head.

If Rose, who worked as a clerical worker under Sylberthal, doesn't know, then maybe... he was forgotten by Sylberthal after that first time?

...Poor guy.
