# Chapter 8: Journey Through Hell (2)

We discovered a strange settlement while traveling through the Abyss. It's not that the form of the settlement is strange, but the fact that there's a settlement in \[The Abyss\] itself is odd.

"Shall we go and check it out?"

"......"

Rose hesitated a little at my question.

The Abyss is essentially a place in the demon world where evil souls, the raw materials for demonic souls, fall. Whirlwinds swirl around, shattering these souls, so souls can't exist for long.

There are cases where some, like that certain baron, manage to survive by narrowly escaping the shredder, but it's not normally possible for such souls to gather and form a settlement.

Rose knew I wanted to hurry back, so she seemed worried about the detour.

"Maybe they know the exact location of the demonic energy pool?"

"...Let's go."

We had been deciding our direction by instinct, but if we knew the exact location, we might be able to shorten our journey. When I said that, Rose's scholarly curiosity got the better of her and we decided to go to the settlement.

"But, in this vast Abyss, the probability of encountering something is extremely low. Why do we keep meeting so many things?"

"......"

Rose's eyes spoke volumes, saying, 'Aren't you a bit of a troublemaker?'

It's true that this \[Abyss\] is as vast as the world of Atra, at least the part that faces the back of Atra. Just as the world is surrounded by space, the other parts are said to be endless wastelands. Souls of fallen demons and evil humans can also fall into those areas.

Probably, in a region as vast as the world, there aren't many souls capable of communicating, so I understand what Rose is saying.

However, while human souls that fall outside are forcibly decomposed, it seems that high-ranking demons are naturally drawn to the demonic energy pools that send souls to the demon world, so it's probably not my fault that we keep encountering them.

As we approached the settlement (or what seemed like one), we saw booths made of stacked rocks, as there were no trees or cloth in this barren Abyss. And indeed, there were human-like figures there, and if you thought about it, it didn't look so much like a settlement.

"Basically, it's just a bunch of people gathered together."

"...I guess so."

Even so, it's very unusual for so many souls to gather in this Abyss.

Why are so many souls gathering in this place? The easiest way to find out is to ask someone.

I was also a very ordinary human being, and even after becoming a devil, I have pride in living humbly and behaving myself. But when you become powerful, you tend to become a little careless.

So, even though I knew that the souls falling here were a bunch of crazy people who were on par with that certain baron, we approached the first villager we found without hesitation.

"Oh, how unusual! To find such a lovely young lady in such a remote place. Please, have a seat, though we have nothing to offer."

“....”

The skinny old man in strange clothes greeted us with a very cheerful smile.

...Something's off. People who fall into this Abyss should have souls so sinful that even spirits can't purify them, yet he has such a refreshing and content look on his face.

"Strange clothing."

"Oh, is that so? These are our battle uniforms..."

In response to Rose the blue weasel's question, the uncle replied with a rather proud smile.

"Yurushia, what's wrong?"

"...No, nothing."

I avoided Rose's questioning gaze, unusually silent.

I... know this.

It is the deepest darkness in the universe, born from the human race...you could even say it is a curse born from humanity's endless desires.

Their strange clothing...

Black boots made of animal leather. Pants in the color of mice or dark enough to blend into the night, with a jacket of the same color, and a white shirt underneath, with a slightly wide cloth tied around their necks like a rope, proudly displayed like livestock.

Does this curse sacrifice their eyesight? Nearly half of them were protecting their eyes with tools called 'glasses' while carving the rocks obsessively, but when we appeared, they greeted us kindly and smiled gently, making them even more frightening.

Rose, a pure-blooded demon, seemed more curious than horrified by the horror I felt.

"Why are you here?"

When Rose suddenly asked a pointed question, the old men changed their smiles to difficult expressions and told us about their lives.

"We appeared here suddenly one day. Maybe... no, we probably died. I don't know if this is hell, but those of us with the same feelings naturally gathered here and started working."

"Huh... You know you're dead but you still work?"

"When we were alive, we worked and worked and worked until we died..."

The old men's eyes became increasingly strange as they answered Rose's question.

"We left home before sunrise and slept on the train, and during our lunch break, we continued to work while eating the bento boxes sold in the company, and returned home on the last train late at night."

"There were times when... no, it was good enough to be able to go home. Sometimes we would sleep in chairs at the company."

"I haven't spoken to my family in years. But everyone would be in trouble if I didn't work. I supported the company!"

"For that, spending time with my family is a trivial matter! Even if I didn't get overtime pay, even if my wife and children treated me poorly, work was my life!"

"Working overtime for 200 hours a month is nothing! Why can’t my family understand that going out for a drink with my boss and making work go more smoothly is an important way to get work done, rather than just going home early every once in a while?”

"H-heh..."

The old men, who were heatedly using incomprehensible words, tightened the cloth around their necks in unison. Rose, who had even evolved into an Arch Demon, took a step back with a shocked look on her face.

Oh, how sinful these people are, happily boasting about their misfortune and poor health. It's no wonder their souls ended up in the Abyss.

Moreover, since the world they came from had no magic and no 'spirits' to manage souls, reincarnation must have been so haphazard that strong souls like theirs were thrown into another world.

And surely, the spirits of that other world couldn't understand the state of their souls and gave up on purifying them, dropping them straight into the Abyss.

"What cursed souls they are..."

"Yeah, I guess so."

Even Rose, a demon, shuddered at their existence, and though I couldn't understand their sentiments, I could understand the words, so I scratched my cheek and nodded casually.

"By the way, what are you making?"

To divert attention from the depressing topic, I, who had been listening silently until then, asked that. At that moment, they all turned around with gleaming eyes.

"Thank you for asking!"

"We are beings who must work. But there is no work, and no employment agency!"

"Every day, we stack stones, and the whirlwinds that arise destroy the stones we have stacked, and we practice evacuation without fail. We spend our days gathering again and stacking them up."

"Is there no god for us sinners!? But then one day, we heard a 'voice' that could be called a divine revelation!"

And they began to chant the same words in unison.

"Come, young people. Come, seasoned warriors.

Job duties: Drying seaweed and processing seafood. And a little bit of fighting.

Daily pay: 1 kg of dried seaweed. 24-hour workdays. Total annual leave: eight hours.

Bonus: Squid jerky and a soul will be provided based on contribution.

No experience required. No age limit. We welcome those with a positive attitude.

Those who can work more than 25 hours a day through time control are especially welcome.

A dark workplace where kind superiors will teach you your job carefully.

Employees who make a great contribution can even shake hands with the Golden Lord.

Recruitment period, number of recruits, until the entire world is destroyed.

Golden Saint Demon Army - Yuru Kaisan Co., Ltd."

"......"

Rose looked at me slowly.

I slowly averted my gaze at the same speed.

"We were overjoyed! What a wonderful thing. If we could get a job there, we could work forever without starving or sleeping!"

"This was the only hope given to us who had been stacking stones in this dark place!"

"So we train our souls every day to sculpt a Buddha statue until we receive a job offer from the 'Golden Lord'."

Sculpt? Shouldn't it be carve?

"Thousands of our comrades have already gone to the Golden Saint Demon Army, without forgetting their goals, even as they were crushed by whirlwinds! There are others with the same lofty goals in other settlements. If we can acquire the same unwavering spirit, even if our souls are shattered by the whirlwind, we will immediately go to the Lord!"

Come to think of it, there were about that many employees...

Huh, hmm, hmm.... Well, it doesn't matter.

By the way, I hadn't seen anyone taking a break even though it was supposed to be a 23-hour workday, so perhaps it was actually a 24-hour shift...

I lost interest in this settlement, or rather, I felt uncomfortable, so I tried to leave before my identity was revealed, but they continued talking.

"However, some devil worshipers became jealous of our glorious future and started attacking us!"

"Huh..."

Oh, this is taking a bad turn.

"We pride ourselves on being corporate warriors, but we are not yet good at fighting."

"Moreover, they have a high-ranking demon they worship, and that demon gives direct orders and harasses us!"

"Hmm..."

So there are such petty demons.

"They call that demon 'Hiraines'."

"What!?"

Rose looked at me as if she had been hit, and I gasped in unison.

...Who was that again!?
