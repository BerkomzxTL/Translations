# Side Story 3: An Unfamiliar World

Hello everyone. It's Yurushia again, bringing you another update.

I've been swamped with work lately, but today I thought I'd show you what I've been up to.

As you know, I'm basically a fusion of a Dark Spirit King and a Demon, so my main job is managing the souls that reincarnate into this world. ...Well, the \[Worlds\] I manage aren't limited to just this one.

There are thousands of them.

...That's because the entire domain of that damn demon is now under my control. It's a ridiculous number.

So, it's only natural that I sometimes skip work and go play in another world. Even though I always get caught and scolded by my husband.

Even so, \[Mad Princess\]... just how far did you spread your influence? Out of those thousands of worlds, 70% are inhabited by humanoids with similar genes to Earthlings, and half of those have cultures similar to medieval Earth.

I knew she had a thing for creating similar cultures, but I found evidence of her spreading humanoid genes even on undeveloped planets.

I think it's highly likely that in worlds where archaeology couldn't find any intermediate stages between apes and humans, Sylberthal sowed the seeds.

...She's been doing this for over 100,000 years.

There must be tons of worlds that she abandoned as failed experiments because they didn't suit her tastes and had to start over. Even Earth might not be her first try.

Anyway, today I'm going to show you the management of one particular world.

Some worlds have regions where people are caught up in dramatic love-hate relationships, like in an otome game, but the world I'm focusing on today is more like an MMORPG, where you gain skill experience and level up.

In that world, there are humans, elves, dwarves, beastmen, and monsters – it's a pretty "normal" world. ...What even is "normal"? Putting aside such philosophical considerations, in that world, there exists a goddess who bestows abilities as \[Skills\].

Seeing how weak humans were and how many were being killed by vicious monsters, the goddess took pity on the mortals and bestowed her blessings upon them.

But now, this goddess is being overworked like a corporate slave who only eats dried seaweed and works 23 hours a day, and her life is being eaten away.

If you do your job normally, this won't happen. Some goddesses brag about their beautiful voices and announce every level-up, even getting tonsillitis, but that's their own fault.

So, let's take a peek at what kind of lives people lead in the world of this goddess.

Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to become a blacksmith. His father was a famous swordsmith, and when he came of age at the age of 15, he trained hard every day in order to make swords that would surpass his father's.

Clang, clang – you could hear the sound of a hammer striking metal. The boy was in his workshop, making nails as part of his training.

“Jim (not his real name), you're really putting in the effort today.”

“Of course, Dad! I'm your son, after all.”

Jim (not his real name) was shaping iron rods into nails with a hammer, making countless nails every day. His father picked up one of the finished nails and examined it, frowning.

“Jim (not his real name), these are too well-made. It'll take you too long.”

“Yeah, I know.. I'll have to work (a bit) harder to increase my output! I reckon I can start making D-rank swords if I make another 5,000.”

His father smiled gently at his son's shining eyes and placed a hand on his shoulder.

“That's my boy. Making nails is the most efficient way to gain blacksmithing skill experience. I made millions of nails before I could make A-rank swords. Keep it up.”

“Yes, Dad!”

...Huh? Something's wrong.

There once was a young girl in a certain town who aspired to be a seamstress. In that town, there was a famous tailor, and the girl, admiring that tailor wishing to be able to make beautiful dresses herself, trained every day.

“...Ugh, my eyes are so blurry, I can’t see anymore.”

“You shouldn’t overwork yourself, Mary (name withheld). If you hurt yourself, it's all for nothing.”

“It’s okay, mother. No matter how tired I am, it’s not difficult when it’s for the sake of my dream.”

Saying this, Mary (not her real name) concentrated intently on threading the needle over and over again in a room lit only by lamplight.

Despite her weary eyes and trembling fingers, she refused to give up on her dream.

“I want to thread the needle ten thousand more times today. Even though it’s the very basics and the skill experience is minimal, if I can just improve my skill level, I’m sure my dream will come true.”

“Mary (provisional)...”

………What are you doing?

There once was a young nobleman in a certain castle. His family was known as a distinguished family of warriors. His grandfather was a swordsman who had won many battles against monsters, and his father was a hero who had protected the country many times as a knight commander.

The young man, their son, also wanted to serve his country like his grandfather and father, but no matter how many times he swung his wooden sword, his swordsmanship skill level didn't improve as he hoped.

"Pierre (pseudonym)"

"Grandfather (Sword Saint)!" 

In front of his beloved grandfather (the Sword Saint), Pierre (pseudonym) looked down ashamed at the fact that his skill level had not improved despite swinging his wooden sword every day, and the grandfather (the Sword Saint) quietly nodded as he watched his grandson.

"Look up, Pierre (pseudonym). I've seen how hard you work. I think it's about time I taught you the secret techniques of our family. Follow me."

"Grandfather (Sword Saint)..."

When Pierre (the grandson) was taken by his grandfather (the sword saint) down to the castle's basement, he found a closed room where many small slimes were being kept.

"What is this...?"

"Pierre (pseudonym), this is a secret teaching in our family. The most efficient way to use swordsmanship skills is to cut down living creatures. However, Pierre (grandson), if you're just trying to improve your skills, there's no need to go out of your way to cut down strong foes."

"Is that true, Grandfather?"

"That's right, Pierre (grandson). Go ahead and raise your skill level here to your heart's content."

"Yes!"

So, Pierre (pseudonym) chased after the small slimes that were squeaking and running away, raising his swordsmanship skill level.

…………What is this?

Don't mess with me, are you underestimating the value of skill?! They're all just efficiency freaks who are finding loopholes in the level system! Do they really think they can acquire true skill that way?!

I don't know how it was at first, but because of them, the goddess of this world was working non-stop every day, designing clothes and accessories, secretly adjusting the taste of food, and coming up with new battle techniques, until she had dark circles under her eyes.

Ahem... I got a bit excited there.

However, now that I know about it, I can't just sit back and ignore it.

I decided to help the goddess, who was overworking herself to bestow blessings on people, by hitting her on the back of the neck and putting her to sleep... and bestowing the blessings myself.

There's no way you can make a divine sword just by making nails! There's no way you can make beautiful dresses just by threading a needle! There's no way you can slay a dragon just by chasing slimes!

I reject it all, I reject it!

'...'

The goddess woke up about a thousand years later.

For some reason, one day, humans suddenly lost all their skills. They lost not only the ability to fight but also their entire livelihood, and were left defenseless against the threats of monsters.

However, even though humans were weak, they were highly adaptable.

Reflected in the goddess's stunned gaze was the sight of humans who had evolved into muscular primitives with extraordinary reproductive abilities that allowed them to mate with any species, chasing away orcs with nothing but fur loincloths and clubs.

"Sigh..."

On a terrace in the dark palace overlooking the world, I took a sip of the fragrant roasted tea brought by my maid and sighed.

"Is something the matter, Yuru-sama?"

"Well, Rose, I was thinking that there are a lot of people who try to cheat the rules of the world, and it's quite ridiculous."

"Ridiculous..."

Hearing those words, Rose muttered, took something out of her pocket and held it up to me.

"Yuru-sama, would you like to look in the mirror?"

"..."
