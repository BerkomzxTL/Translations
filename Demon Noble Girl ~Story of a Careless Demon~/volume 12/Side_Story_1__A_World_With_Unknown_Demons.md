# Side Story 1: A World With Unknown Demons

Author’s Note: From here on, the story becomes boring and unrelated to the main story.

The basic concept of this work is that "as one character in many stories, a monster that can destroy the story from its very foundations lurks innocently," so it contains many parodies.

Please forgive me for everything. Or rather, I'm sorry.

---

I, Yurushia, defeated Sylberthal, became a Queen in the human world, and was worshiped as a goddess.

In a few decades or centuries, there will be a war with the Demon Lords of the Demon World, but for now, it might be okay to live a leisurely life... or so I thought, but being a Queen is surprisingly busy.

There's a constant stream of meetings and audiences from neighboring countries. I've mostly left it all up to Noah and Rose, but even so, they don't leave unless I at least show my face, and I'm afraid that if I leave everything to the pure-blooded demons, those countries will end up being destroyed.

And if I go back to my parents’ house too often to escape reality, it doesn't look good.

Even though I'm worshiped as a goddess, my believers are all balding men and flat-chested women, so their requests are quite desperate, and they pray with such intense, desperate eyes that I honestly find their faces scary.

So, since I've gained the power to surpass even the gods (physically), I've decided to relieve stress by sneaking out and going on little adventures without my attendants noticing.

＊＊＊

I've acquired various attributes, but at my core, I'm a \[Devil\], a mischievous demon who travels through countless worlds in countless dimensions, causing trouble as a prankster… no, to collect souls.

Well, 90% of high-ranking beings are mischievous, so if you give them a good reaction, they'll go home satisfied, so if you get the chance, give it a try.

Just like that, I randomly jumped into a dimension as if drawing a lottery ticket, and I sensed the presence of a 'demon' coming from a certain direction.

But, isn't it a bit different? It's somehow different from us, spiritual beings known as demons. (Vague)

We demons have physical bodies in the third dimension, but we are essentially spiritual beings, and we rely on 'vessels' by parasitizing or using three-dimensional matter as a core.

However, the presence of the "demon" I felt from that direction was closer to the material world, or like a biological species, and although its existence was similar to a demon like me, it felt more... yeah, 'raw.'

So I gave this being the provisional name of 'Raw Demon' and decided to visit that 'other world' to see what kind of existence it was.

The world I landed in was very similar to 'Japan' on Earth.

... Or was it Earth? No, no, maybe not. The 'atmosphere' was somehow different, and it had a bit of a Showa-era feel to it.

They had TVs and telephones, but no portable information devices.

If a teenage blonde gothic-lolita girl walked around in such a place, she'd definitely stand out. So, just in case, I disguised myself with a cold mask and sunglasses that I had my employees make just in case something like this happened.

…Even if I say so myself, I'm extremely suspicious. But if I show my true face, weak-hearted people will lose their souls, so it's better than nothing.

The aura of the so-called 'Raw Demon' isn't from just one being. In fact, there are tens of thousands of them. Apparently, most of them are pretending to be human, but their demonic nature and cruelty are subtly leaking out, so they're not hiding very well..

If one of my employees did the same thing, I'd send them to a different department for three years tasked with picking out tiny shrimp and crab mixed into dried seaweed with tweezers.

Anyway, ignoring the fact that those tiny shrimp and crab could be sold for a pretty good price when packaged together, I found two peculiar boys with a strange presence in this world.

They were a pair that somehow caught my eye. If this were a story, they would be the protagonist and his companion.

A timid-looking boy who seemed to be about high school age and a beautiful boy with a dangerous look in his eyes.

The beautiful boy had a trench coat and was carrying a shotgun, and he was driving a car normally, so perhaps this Japan is different from the one I know.

They left in a car, so I started stalking them. On foot.

Even demons need to stay healthy. There's no way my body, made from fresh souls harvested first thing in the morning and high-quality seaweed, could keep up with a car on foot.

But the two boys had unhealthily chosen to go into a club-like place - not a club for school activities, but a place where young adults drink and dance.

That’s no good. It was too early for the timid boy. So I was about to make the building 'disappear' with a burst of my energy when the beautiful boy started causing trouble and was being beaten up by the people around him.

Apparently, he needed to 'lose his reason' to summon a demon.

...High school students and their edgy phases, huh?

Having no choice, I secretly joined in and stepped on the heel of the boy who was being beaten up.

When I looked up, the timid boy had become a 'demon' and was running around all over the place.

Oh, cool. I honestly admire the design, which is like a classic demon. I'll copy it the next time I raise a demon.

The timid boy changed back into his human form and started searching for the beautiful chuunibyou  boy, so I quickly hid, only to see the timid boy holding the battered chuunibyou  boy in his arms and crying, saying something like, "Don't go and leave me behind."

Ah, sorry... I think I stepped too hard.

Apparently, their goal is to become demonized while preserving their human selves to fight against the hidden demons and protect humanity.

What a noble reason... I feel a little ashamed of myself, casually becoming a demon and randomly picking up the souls of stray murderers. But I can't stop. I have an appetite for them, after all. Sniffing and eating souls, yum.

Although he seemed to have retained his sense of self, the timid boy had become increasingly violent and began wearing bright yellow T-shirts with the letter "A" written in red.

The edgy beautiful boy, who failed to demonize, was looking at the timid boy with a dangerously admiring gaze. This is bad.

For the time being, I have decided to provisionally name the timid boy "Boy A."

A few days later, Boy A found himself in trouble the moment I took my eyes off him.

I don't stalk them every day. I've been sitting in the shrine, providing salvation to people with 'thin' body parts and doing the important job of receiving 'offerings' like rice crackers and dumplings.

When I arrived at the scene with more onsen manju than I could carry, Boy A was fighting a sexy demon sister with wings growing from her head.

Yeah, she's erotic. Innocent and straightforward Boy A wouldn't be able to fight her properly. I poured a little extra magic power into my right hand, ready to help out if necessary. ...If I put in a little too much, I might accidentally wipe out a mountain, but I'm sure it'll be fine. Probably.

While I was nervously wondering if it was really okay to fire this magic, Boy A had already won. That's good. Even a narrow victory is a victory.

The edgy beautiful boy picked up Boy A's severed arm and stuck it back together. The look in the eyes of the edgy beautiful boy as he stared at the unconscious Boy A is scary.

... Am I about to witness an inappropriate scene? I don't have that kind of hobby, but if it were filmed, it might sell for a high price to the daughters of nobles.

...N-nothing happened.

Apparently, hidden demons have started rampaging everywhere, and a 'demon hunt' has become popular among humans, similar to a 'witch hunt.'

They have some guts. What would they do if they encountered a real demon?

But apparently, demons who retain their human selves can't fight or kill people. ... Ah, what? I have a human self too, but I feel like I've been doing it while laughing normally...

Never mind that. The problem is this world.

Apparently, Boy A is gathering people who have retained their sense of self and forming an army to fight against the demons.

A little later, there were some misfortunes involving Boy A, but I was fine.

Two types of demons were fighting, dividing the world in two.

Surprisingly, it turned out that the crazy, edgy, beautiful boy was the king of the demons.

Apparently, the crazy, edgy, masochistic beautiful boy had been doing various things to save the 'Raw Demons' who had been abandoned by the gods.

...Really, Gods are so selfish.

I hadn't been paying much attention because I had been destroying nuclear weapons all over the world, but most of the normal humans seemed to be gone.

... Maybe I accidentally weakened humanity's fighting power?

But if they used nuclear weapons, I wouldn't be able to catch seafood nearby.

The seafood I summon is summoned from the oceans of all worlds and all times, so contaminated ones are not marketable, so it's troublesome. (Seriously)

After a while, while I was wasting time scattering dried seaweed as fish food on a remote island in the South Seas, the demons' war seemed to be over.

... They're almost all dead.

The edgy, masochistic beautiful boy with wings was talking to Boy A, who only had an upper body. I watched them from afar while nibbling on dried squid.

Then, beings that looked like shiny gods descended from the sky.

Ahh... So there are real gods.

Oh no. I was spotted by a god on the edge.

So, being the fastest demon in the demon world, I instantly moved behind the god and snapped its neck while applying a chokehold. With my current abilities, whether they're tangible or not, I'm confident I can snap anything, even an octopus bone, if I decide to.

But that created a hole in the gods' formation. This is bad.

The gods had just descended in style, so this ruined their image, and I felt a heavy responsibility for messing up.

So, I took the place of the god whose neck I had broken and started glowing.

Phew... I managed to deceive them.

Most of the humans in this world have disappeared.

I didn't run away because things got awkward, no, I didn't...but I'm currently standing here on the coastline and seriously considering the future of this world.

Thanks to the power of the Spirit King, I've been recycling the dead souls after taking a little nibble. But if there are no humans as a species, no humans will be born.

But as if to encourage me, several figures emerged from the sea.

Wow...

It turned out to be the dried seaweed I had scattered in the sea.

Did Sylberthal, who regenerated the world, feel this way...?

The seaweed, which had connected with the recycled souls and become new humans, beat their chests as if to encourage themselves, saying, 'Leave this world to us,' and returned to the sea.

Seeing this, I felt relieved and decided to return to my world, Atra.

... It's not that I ran away because I felt awkward.

＊＊＊

"Master, where have you been?"

"I went to another world to regenerate it..."

I quietly looked away from the two butlers, Noah and Geas, who were holding a pile of documents and intimidating me with a smile on their faces.
