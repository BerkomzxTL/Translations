# Side Story 14

TN: No chapter title…  

---

"I'm Cedar Pollen-chan\! I bring happiness to everyone from February to April\!"  
*THUD*  
"I'm Cypress Pollen-chan\! I bring happiness to everyone from March to May\!"  
*BAM*  
"Um..."  
"This is Koro-chan\! She isn't pollen, but she was causing trouble all year, so we, with our sense of justice, made her turn over a new leaf and let her join us\!"  
"No, it's more like my toxicity went down because I spread myself too thin, so I couldn't really cause much trouble..."  
"So\!"  
Koro-chan, who was called that name, tried to object to the Pollen-chans, but Cedar Pollen-chan and her group never listened to what anyone else had to say from the start.  
"We can only make everyone happy from spring to summer\!"  
"We wanted you to work hard in autumn and winter, but Koro-chan, you weren't as useful as we thought\!"  
"No, so I'm not pollen..."  
"So\! (***DRUMROLL***) To make everyone happy all year long, we're going to defeat and make disciples out of those weeds, Ragweed Pollen and Rice Pollen\!"  
"Those guys are so stuck-up and cheeky for being weeds\! Let's beat them up\!"  
"No, you should just get along with other pollen instead of taking in someone who's not even related to you."

\*\*\*

"―That's what happened\! They are so incorrigible\!"  
"Hah..."

Lately, prices have been high, and Onza-kun's ramen shop in the city is apparently seriously considering a price hike, but if you don't have noodles, why not just eat seaweed?  
I am Yurushia, Queen of the Holy Nation and everyone’s beloved Evil God, who was scolded in all seriousness for saying such a thing.  
Well then\!

"Those guys came barging over to me, and told me to delay the growth of rice\! I really don't know what they’re thinking\!"  
"Hah..."  
I replied with an unenthusiastic tone to the black-haired little girl who suddenly started talking in front of me.  
What is this little girl...  
Today, I got tired of my duties as queen... or rather, while I was taking a break and glancing through an interdimensional window at the thousand worlds I manage, a desperate thought was suddenly sent to me from a world I knew. When I somehow summoned the sender, this little girl appeared.

"...How old are you?"  
"Um, I'm almost seven\!"  
"I see..."  
This little girl seems to be working at that age. This child, she's from that world, right? If she's from Yuzu's world, she must be starting first grade this year?  
"...Why don't you stop working and just make a hundred friends normally?"  
"No\! The previous person has already retired, and I have to protect the world of the humans\!"  
"Hmm?"  
Could it be that this child isn't human? She has enough power to notice me and call out, so maybe she's some kind of spirit?  
"...Well, for now, tell me about it."  
"Okay..."  
The black-haired, twin-tailed little girl in a pink kimono, who was sitting seiza-style on the cushion I offered her, ate the Tako Parfait (seafood) that Fannie made and tearfully began to recount her story. What she said was…

"............"  
It seems those pollen-chans are still doing as they please even after making a group.  
It seems wrong to expect intelligence from pollen, but in short, it's impossible to persuade them with words.  
In that case, as a goddess with roots in that world, why don't I give this little girl a piece of advice\!

"Listen carefully. You must not be humble with people like them. It's useless to listen to them. They're not saying anything important anyway."  
"I-is that so...?"  
"That's right. You mustn't be weak-willed. Be confident and give them a good smack down\!"  
"...Okay\! I'll do my best\!"

The timid-looking little girl spirit seemed impressed by the words of me, the main god. She returned to her world with a clear and refreshed look on her face.  
When I do a job like this as a manager, I really do feel a sense of satisfaction.

"Yurushia-sama, that is quite unusual."  
"Fannie? You know that kid?"  
"That thing is small, but it's the same existence as ‘Tokyo’."  
"...Eh."  
That kid... is a "True God"\!? No way\!?  
She was born after that one was sealed? That kid?  
...W-well, she's much weaker, so it should be fine, probably\!

\*\*\*

“"GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!\!"”  
"...Why me too?"  
The black-haired little girl, with a twisting motion of a remote control's dial, finally repelled the pollen-chans who were trying to push an unreasonable request on her.

"As long as I'm here, I won't let you do whatever you want\!"  
Gaining courage from the main god's encouragement, the black-haired little girl protected humans' health and comfortable lives by making it over 30 degrees Celsius in February, causing it to snow in March, and skipping the unpleasant rainy season to have sweltering heat every day.

The battle of the out-of-control black-haired little girl, "Reiwa-chan," continues\!

---

Don't push yourself\!  
I tried writing Reiwa-chan in my own way\!  
Everyone, please take care of your health.
