# Chapter 1: Abyss

"......\[The Abyss\]......?"

As the words spilled from my mouth, I turned my gaze towards a world of black mist that seemed to stretch to the very end of the universe.

Having returned from another world, I had thwarted the machinations of the Sylber Kingdom, which had been secretly meddling in the Holy Kingdom and causing internal strife. I had fought against the chimeras—creatures that defied the world's laws by being a combination of humans, spirits, and demons—and had managed to expel the influence of the Sylber Kingdom from the Holy Kingdom, all while contending with the \[True Demon Lord\] that had somehow taken root within me.

The \[True Demon Lord\] is a reset mechanism created by the world. When intelligent life forms become a bit too unruly, the world might trigger a global flood to wash away civilization (like a laxative), or it might send a so-called 'Demon Lord, a secret 'child of God', into the family of a powerful nation's leader, causing intelligent beings to fight among themselves and become extinct (like a purgative).

But if the world becomes so polluted that it can't be saved, the world creates a \[True Demon Lord\], and the world is reset to a state where only deep-sea microorganisms can survive in an environment of primordial, molten lava and acid rain.

...Why do I have a part of such a thing inside me?

That's why I decided to crush the church that created these chimeras to prevent my inner \[True Demon Lord\] from running amok. I couldn't just let them mess with my 'garden' and become a recluse. It would be a waste of my femininity.

While on my way to the Sylber Kingdom, and as I was gradually thwarting their plans, I began to see the shadow of a certain being lurking behind it. Well, to be more precise, I had gotten some wisdom from my "self-proclaimed older brother". This shadow’s true identity was one of the three most ancient demon lords in the demon world. A being who had existed since before the birth of humanity, who had bestowed wisdom upon countless worlds and casually destroyed them - the Mad Princess Sylberthal.

Don’t mess with me. That's just too monstrous.

And so, a game began between me and Sylberthal, with the entire continent as our board.

After various twists and turns, I was threatened with subjugation by Sylberthal, who had even managed to subdue the Spirit King of Light. But I refused because she had put her hands on something important to me. I fought with every trick in the book, but since the difference in our power was like that between an adult and an infant, I was easily defeated.

However, thanks to some preparations I had made, I managed to regenerate, barely. I'd never win another lottery like this twice in a row, even if you asked me to.

But I survived. I was reduced to a tiny child of about five years old, far from a full recovery, but I, Yurushia the Demon, was alive!

"'What are you doing, you idiot?'"

A bored, calm voice came from beneath me as I raised both my arms and pumped my fist in a cheer with all my heart and soul.

Rose, a blue ferret in appearance but a demon in essence, was originally an Arch Demon under Sylberthal. She had caused me quite a bit of trouble, but she was easily discarded by Sylberthal and fell with me all the way down here. Surprisingly, she's quite tenacious.

“You're making so much noise that souls are reacting from all over the place.”

Come to think of it, I thought my inner scream was quite loud, but countless mournful cries were echoing from the world of black mist.

“Rose, what's the Abyss?”

“You don't know!? You're supposed to be a High-Ranking Demon, aren't you!?”

'Supposed to be' is an exaggeration. Well, maybe not from the perspective of other High-Rank Demons.

I have to admit, my knowledge is quite biased. It's not something to be proud of. My knowledge consists of what I learned as a human, what I instinctively learned as a demon, what Rinne taught me, what I learned as a noble, what I gained as a demon god... and about half of it comes from the wisdom my "self-proclaimed older brother" sends from the other side of the dimension.

I'm often surprised when I learn new knowledge or come across unfamiliar words, but I'm used to it now.

Rose had mentioned something about the bottom of the demon world, a place that even demons couldn't perceive, and a place where tainted souls became demons. But apparently, even wisdom can't reach such a place.

"Rose, tell me."

"'...Fine, I'll tell you.” 

Even as she sighed and complained, Rose perked up her ears and began to explain.

The bottom of the demon world... essentially, it's a dimension below the demon world, the darkest place in all the dimensions, including the fairy realm, the material world, the spirit realm, and the demon world. Saying it's "below" is just a metaphor, but it means it's closest to the demon world.

You'd think it would be easy to return from there, but it's not that simple.

This place is where souls, so tainted and filthy that even demons can't stand them, or souls destroyed in the material world or other dimensions, fall. Once they fall here, they suffer almost infinite agony, turning into a gooey mess, becoming a spring of evil energy, and are reborn as demons in the demon world or the material world.

Occasionally, a soul with an exceptionally strong will, or one that the great spirit of light, who sorts souls, accidentally drops, might retain its sense of self. In such rare cases, these souls might spontaneously appear in the demon world or the material world.

...Somehow, I feel like I'm being subtly insulted.

Incidentally, Rose has heard rumors of a place called "Heaven" where the souls of the righteous go, and that's where spirit souls are born. Apparently, they're subjected to a kind of drug-like pleasure that twists their souls. Everything in moderation, I suppose.

So, in short, falling into \[The Abyss\] is easy, but getting out and returning to another dimension requires emerging from the pool of demonic energy as a being of demonic energy.

"Wait, I thought I heard that high-ranking demons could gather their consciousness and revive?"

"That's usually the case for those who have lived for a very long time. They've gone through cycles of destruction and rebirth so many times that they know all sorts of tricks. For an Arch Demon like me, who's only a hundred years old... well, I'm basically a low-ranking demon now, so it's impossible. ...What about you?"

"Same here."

I was in real trouble now. How could I return? Regenerating from the pool of demonic energy was like being reborn, and even if I retained my sense of self, I wouldn't know if I could regain my current power.

"Do you know where the demonic energy from this pool flows out, like an exit?"

"...I think if you go towards where the demonic energy is concentrated, you'll find it. This part of the Abyss is closest to Atra, so the souls that fall here and the place where they emerge should be either Atra or a nearby part of the demon world."

"Alright, let's head in that direction then. Maybe we'll find something."

I looked around, trying to figure out which way to go, but there was nothing but black mist in every direction.

"It's just mist. It's so depressing."

"You... have you forgotten how to 'see' as a demon, after spending so long in the material world?"

"Oh, right."

Even though the demon world is essentially a spiritual realm filled with demonic energy, demons have a shared perception of it as a wasteland or a cloudy sky. To be precise, this perception is ingrained in the space, and newborn demons instinctively perceive it that way.

I closed my eyes and read the remnants of perception in the space, then opened my eyes again. Before me was a wasteland similar to the demon world, with rocky terrain and distant whirlwinds and storms.

"'Those whirlwinds are the things that mess up the souls, so don't touch them. They're dangerous, even for you.'"

"Huh... you know a lot about this."

"'Well, I was given the title of \[Demon Scholar\] by Zephirsel, the so-called \[Demon Doctor\] who created me.'"

The blue ferret puffed up her chest proudly. But... wait a minute?

"Who's Zephirsel? Rose is under Sylberthal’s command, right?"

"......"

Rose's brow furrowed at my casual question.

"'...Zephirsel, the Demon Lord, was defeated by the \[Dark Beast\], and his Arch Demons scattered. I was captured by Sylberthal and sworn allegiance to her.'"

"I see..."

So that's what Rinne had been up to. A demon's sworn allegiance is akin to a contract. I see... so that's how she increased her followers. As I looked at Rose more closely, I noticed something different about her.

"Rose... your contract with Sylberthal... is it broken? And your spirit essence seems to have disappeared too?"

"Eh!?'"

As if she had just realized, Rose opened her eyes wide and examined her own body.

Because she had been directly killed by Sylberthal, or perhaps because she had been destroyed once, the scent of Sylberthal had vanished from Rose, and the implanted spirit essence was gone.

"'Yay! That spirit essence was so disgusting! I'll never forgive her! Si... Sil... Sylberthal!'"

She was cheering, but when she said Sylberthal's name, her legs trembled like a newborn fawn.

Well, it couldn't be helped. Demons were like a hierarchical society. Lower-ranking demons instinctively feared higher-ranking ones, and the difference in power between us and Sylberthal was like that between a small animal, an infant, and an adult.

"But it's a good thing, Rose."

"'Huh?'"

"Won't you be my subordinate?"

"'What!?'"

She was more surprised by this than when she found out she was free from Sylberthal.

"'What are you talking about? I've always been your enemy! And now I'm just a low-ranking demon…”

Oh dear, is that what she's worried about? This girl is easily swayed. She seems like the type to get hooked up with a bad demon and become a kept woman. (Stereotype)

"But your knowledge and wisdom remain, don't they?"

She hadn't been praised much for her intellect as a demon, and her gaze wavered slightly as the corners of her mouth turned up. One more push.

"I need you."

"'...Fine, I guess I'll do it. Besides Noah, all your subordinates are just muscle, so I'll tag along. Be grateful, Yurushia...sama.'"

"Yeah, thanks."

And so, a connection formed between Rose and me, and she officially became my subordinate. I felt my own power increase slightly as a result.

Thus began our journey, the two of us, a demon and her subordinate, who had been sent to the Abyss after being defeated by Sylberthal.
