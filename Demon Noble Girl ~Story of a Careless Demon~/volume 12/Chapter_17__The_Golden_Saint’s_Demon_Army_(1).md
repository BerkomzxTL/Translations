# Chapter 17: The Golden Saint’s Demon Army (1)

"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

The battle between the Arch Demons, surpassing even the greatest of their kind, continued. As Nia spewed black flames that turned the surroundings into a sea of fire, Neige's extreme cold blizzard froze the flames.

Gaaaaaaaaan!

With a sound like heavy iron clashing, Neige's ice claws and Nia's true iron greatsword collided. The shockwave instantly blew away the flames and ice within sight, transforming the area into a barren wasteland.

"...Troublesome."

Neige, whose mouth was slightly distorted, had the ears and tail of a beast and was lightly covered in silver fur all over her body.

Nia's true form was distorted and ugly. Her arms had swelled from the shoulders solely for the purpose of fighting, her legs had transformed into those of a horse for running on the ground, and a twisted, giant horn protruded from her head. The skin peeking out from under her horned head was covered in hard scales, and a deep red light burned like a flame in her pitch-black eyeballs, filled with hatred.

This was the form of Nia, who had been said to be the most gentle in Yurushia’s Army.

Even in such a form, Nia sought power, but Neige was advancing more favorably in the battle between the two Arch Demons.

Yet, Neige's expression was pale because she couldn't finish off Nia despite the difference in power.

Could it be because of that true iron greatsword that Nia was using? Or was there something else that even Neige's eyes couldn't see?

"...!?"

Suddenly feeling an incredibly powerful magical energy, Neige distanced herself from Nia.

However, that magical energy didn't come from Nia. Nia also sensed it and stopped in her tracks, and the two Arch Demons simultaneously turned towards the far-flung frontier of the Church Kingdom.

This magical energy was not on the level of an Arch Demon. What was it then? The great power that even Neige, a being beyond an Arch Demon, instinctively feared was likely the power of a highest-ranking demon.

"...Etincelle?"

Based on Neige's knowledge the only possible candidate was the Arch Demon Etincelle, the commander-in-chief of the Sylberthal Army and the head of her close aides, the "Destroyer".

Among the demons under Sylberthal, currently, only Etincelle had the power to evolve into a Demon Lord. The reason she wasn't evolving was that Sylberthal was intentionally stopping her evolution so that she could evolve under the best conditions and obtain power that surpassed even Yurushia and other Demon Lords.

But would Etincelle, a faithful servant of Sylberthal, ignore her master's will and evolve on her own...? And if she had evolved even while defying orders, what was she threatened by that forced her to evolve?

(...No)

What if... the source of this magical power I'm feeling is an "enemy"?

There are no other Demon Lords who were foolish enough to challenge Sylberthal directly. If it were an enemy, the only possibility would be the demons under Yurushia who have lost their sanity and existed outside of common sense.

(If that's the case, could this Nia be...?)

Focusing her attention on Nia again, she found that Nia was still staring at the direction from which the magical energy was coming. ...But something was different. Neige, a born demon, couldn't understand what it was, but the ominous hatred she had felt earlier had faded, and now Nia was sporting a demonic grin stretching all the way to her ears.

(...Dangerous)

Thinking so once more, Neige decided that in order to eliminate Nia, she must unleash all of her power, even if it meant going against Sylberthal's orders.

"――\[Deification\]――"

As the magical energy showed an abnormal increase, her physical body, which had manifested in the material world, began to grow larger, tearing her wind-eroded maid uniform from the inside out, and she "deified" as the "Wolf God," a local deity of the present world - Neige \[Demon Wolf Princess\].

"Awooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

Her figure was a giant silver wolf over 10 meters long.

She howled at the moon as if she couldn't handle the magical power and giant body that had doubled in an instant, and her power shook the entire Holy Nation with a ground-shaking roar.

Neige was a "demon", but at the same time, she was also an ancient \[Minor God\] who had been worshiped by humans.

This form was sealed by Sylberthal so that she could evolve in the optimal state, and she had also been given the role of defeating all the \[Beasts\], including Rinne, as a \[Beast\] under Sylberthal.

Neige felt so threatened by the demons under Yurushia’s command, including Nia, that she went against her duty.

"...Nia. Die here."

The magical power and pressure made Nia turn to Neige and she began to laugh tremulously, leaking a distorted voice like cracked pottery.

"――Noah――Can you hear me?――"

Splat!

A bloody head like that of a human child popped out of Nia's left shoulder lump and let out an anguished cry that would make a human want to cover their ears.

Those who knew her well would realize that the head had the same face as Nia when she was younger. It was the remnant of a soul that Nia and her four followers had devoured as a sacrifice but had not assimilated, and which had been chewed to pieces as an enemy of Yurushia.

As she tore it off with her left hand, another terrible scream echoed around, and Nia put it into her mouth and chewed it again, and magical power began to overflow from her body and began to transform again.

Neige, who had been calmly observing the situation, attacked Nia in her wolf form. Even though she knew it wouldn't reach her, Neige called out to Etincelle in her heart: 

(Ethancel -- prepare yourself!)

＊＊＊

"...You..."

With hair that shimmered like flames, copper-colored skin, and pure-white eyes, Etincelle, having revealed her true demonic nature, let out a low voice that resonated from the depths of the earth as she confronted Noah.

She wondered why things had turned out this way.

Unlike the other demons, Etincelle, as the overall commander of the Sylberthal Army, was aware of the life and death of the higher-ranking demons close to Arch Demons.

Leyon...Nui... They were powerful among the Arch Demons and were high-ranking demons chosen as close aides among the demons under Sylberthal, but their presence had suddenly disappeared.

They had probably fought and lost against the Arch Demons under Yurushia. Several other Arch Demons and even Sub-Arch Demon-class demons had fought against the remnants of Yurushia’s Army and their presence had vanished.

And then a demon with immense magical power appeared nearby.

This magical power was still far from Sylberthal's, and it couldn't even reach Rinne or Yurushia either.

But as a demon, she could understand it.

A Supreme Demon had manifested on Earth—probably a \[Demon Lord\]――

Since it has only just evolved, it wouldn't currently pose a threat to Sylberthal, but it wasn’t a being who could be left alone.

Why were the demons under Yurushia fighting so hard? Though they are spiritual beings, they possess the irrational passions of creatures from this world, and even Etincelle, who has lived for a long time, was unable to comprehend them.

"Hahahahahahahahahah!"

Noah, wearing a mask resembling the skull of a male goat, released a magical shockwave with his \[Emission\] ability.

At the same time, thousands of greater demons, who had removed their own limiters by losing their sanity, attacked Etincelle like an avalanche.

A pillar of flame hundreds of meters in diameter scorched even the heavens as Etincelle countered it with the great flame that erupted from her whole body.

"...Tch"

Etincelle clicked her tongue, having burned most of the attacking greater demons to death.

Etincelle had also brought with her several thousand greater demons and hundreds of chimeras, but there were almost none left.

However, that wasn't because Yurushia’s Army was superior. Even if the demons of Yurushia’s Army had special powers, the balance of forces should have been almost equal because of the chimeras, but most of them had perished, caught up in the battle between Etincelle and Noah due to Yurushia’s Army's reckless all-out attacks without even considering self-preservation.

"......"

Etincelle was forced to make up her mind.

Even if she were to become alone here, her superiority in the battle against Noah would not change. But now that a demon lord-like being had been born among Yurushia’s Army and her master Sylberthal was still hidden in the unique subspace \[Hellgate\] while fighting the beast Rinne, Etincelle herself needed to deal with it herself and bring the situation to an end.

Sensing this, Neige released her own seal and revealed her true nature as a \[Minor God\], demanding an immediate resolution.

Even now, the situation was changing rapidly, and even more powerful magical forces could be sensed ravaging this land, Sylberthal’s garden.

(...I apologize, Lady Sylberthal!)

With a crack, a fissure ran across Etincelle's face, and Noah and the other demons, sensing the extraordinary magical power, all stopped moving. It wasn't just caution that made them stop; their demonic instincts were filled with awe of that great being.

As cracks spread across Etincelle's entire body, the barrier that overflowed from her corrupted the land over a wide area, and poisonous flowers bloomed as if sprouting from the rotten earth, and poisonous springs gushed forth.

Poison and evil spirits ascended upwards, forming clouds and driving away the light from the nightless sky of the Sylber Kingdom.

At that moment, Etincelle's body disintegrated, and a large amount of flame overflowed like a tsunami, instantly incinerating the remaining demons and chimeras.

From the flames emerged a fiery giant. But its form was not like that of Ifrit, the great fire spirit; it had a sinister shape, like a dragon distorted into a humanoid form.

The flames converged...

Crack! Lightning flashed as if shaking the heavens, illuminating the new demon that had been born there.

It was... a beautiful female demon with skin that glowed like lava and red hair that shone like rubies.

—The Evil God of Flame— The \[Demon Lord\] Etincelle grinned, her white eyes reflecting Noah, who was the only one left alive.

Noah must have realized it too. That Etincelle's magical power, though newly born, surpassed even Yurushia, who had just arrived in the Holy Church Nation.

"...Kukuku..."

Etincelle let out a low laugh, exhilarated by the power she had gained, albeit slightly different from what she had planned.

—With this power, I can easily destroy a demon who has only recently become a Demon Lord by accident. If I eliminate the remnants of Yurushia's forces with this power, even Lady Sylberthal will forgive me, along with Neige, who has released her seal—

"The game is over. Perish, Noah."

Etincelle’s skin, which had been burning like lava, became covered in black rocks that had turned into obsidian armor. She pointed her right arm, covered in erupting flames, towards Noah, whose mouth had twisted slightly.

"...What's so funny?"

Noah, who should have been on the verge of death from being burned by the flames, was trembling slightly—no, he was laughing.

"...Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That's right, Nia! I can hear you! Etincelle! Can't you hear it? The rumbling, the heartbeat, the breath that echoes from the depths of this land!!!"

As the bighorn sheep mask Noah was wearing cracked slightly and fell off with each laugh, Noah's insane laughter appeared on his blood-stained face.

"Come on, Etincelle... Let's start the feast of your resurrection!"

As Noah laughed, a large amount of blood poured from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, turning into a pitch-black darkness, and the materialized darkness flowed dully, covering the surroundings, and from within it, a huge magical power gushed forth.

＊＊＊

There is no direct path from the spirit world to the physical world. To travel between the two, one must either rely on small, accidental distortions in dimensions or create a magic circle (gate) using a large amount of magical energy. 

In one such spirit world, on the outskirts of the Demon World, a \[Darkness\] of a scale that enveloped the entire world was erupting towards the cloudy sky covering the Demon World, forcibly trying to open a path to the physical world.

The shock caused the Demon World's land to split, shatter, and scatter over millions of kilometers, and hundreds of millions of demons were torn apart and devoured as if being sucked into the \[Darkness\].

In the deep abyss of darkness that no one could see through, a golden light shone particularly brightly.

—I'm coming back — soon—
