# Side Story 6: It's Been Adapted into a Book.

"What are you doing?"

Tina, the head maid holding a stack of papers, asked a silver-haired girl who was in a room she was passing through in the castle.

Tina's official title was 'Head Maid,' and though there were countless lackeys at her beck and call who could carry stacks of paper for her, she still insisted on calling herself a maid, believing that no matter how high she climbed, she should be the one to take care of her master, the Golden Lord, personally.

Though she had passed her mid-teens, she was still growing (except for her chest armor).

"Hmm?"

Fannie, addressed by Tina, turned around with a weak voice, fiddling with a 'substance' in her hand.

"Because it's February."

"February, I see."

In this world, it was called the ‘End of Winter Moon,' but Tina recalled that there was another world where it was called something else.

"February is the season for sweets."

"I see."

It didn't make much sense, but remembering various customs from February in that other world, Tina peered at what Fannie was making. A strange object was taking shape.

“Well, you see, in February, they have a custom where they kill demons, boil their blood, and use it to curse men. The curse is supposed to come back to him tenfold after a month."

"There are some pretty strange customs out there."

In the pot Fannie was boiling, a thick, reddish-brown substance was wriggling and moaning as if in agony.

"It's quite lively."

Would people eat this? For humans, it was a cursed object that would shatter their souls just by getting near it. Tina wondered if it could be a local specialty and thought of sending it to her master's vampire friend. She decided it would be fine for now, and began preparing the stack of papers for mimeograph printing.

"What are you doing, Tina?"

"I am creating a book praising my master."

She thought there weren't enough ways to praise her master. So, Tina decided to print her own book and spread it to many worlds.

Devil Princess

Part 1: The Tale of a Relaxed Demon

Chapter 1: A Demon's Dream

Published by Kodansha K Novels

"Did you write this, Tina?"

"How about 'Haru no Hi Pirori' as a pen name?"

"That's no good!"

＊＊＊

Devil Princess \~ The Tale of a Relaxed Demon \~ is going to be published as a book and adapted into a comic by Kodansha K Novels!

The title will simply be 'Devil Princess'!

The first part will be 'The Tale of a Relaxed Demon.'

Since it's a six-year-old work, I've rewritten everything in my current style, as expressions and trends have changed. I've also added new settings that were decided around the latest chapters, so even those who have read it before can enjoy it as a 'complete edition.'

The release date is still undecided, but I don't think it will take that long, so please look forward to it!
