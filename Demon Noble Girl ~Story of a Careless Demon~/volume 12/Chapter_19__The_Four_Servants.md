# Chapter 19: The Four Servants

"Children, come and try your best."

High above the sleepless city of Veil, the capital of the Sylber Kingdom, Sylberthal, one of the highest-ranking demons, had returned from the Hell Gate and pierced \[Demon Beast\] Rinne, one of the highest-ranking demons, with a giant stone pillar that extended from the earth to the heavens. Beside it, she gracefully waved her left arm and directed a compassionate smile at the insects crawling on the earth.

Even though she had lost her right arm and half her face due to the power of the \[True Demon Lord\] that could reset the world, she shone even more beautifully without the slightest hint of that power.

She understood instantly upon returning to the mortal world that her four closest servants, who had served her for thousands of years, had been annihilated.

She also knew, from the aura filling the air, that it was Yurushia's servants who had continued to resist despite Yurushia's demise and had eventually become 'highest-ranking demons' equal to Yurushia’s rank.

But what did that mean to Sylberthal?

To Sylberthal, everyone else was merely "lowly beings," and even her subordinates were nothing more than "toys" to amuse her boredom.

She needed no one else.

No one else, except herself, could be an "equal," let alone an "enemy."

Sylberthal had not a shred of emotion for others.

It was as if mere "children" had grown up a little, and there was no need for her to be wary at all. Her eyes, filled with compassion, were directed at the children who had been raised to amuse her.

A demon among demons, existing since before the birth of humanity, who had bestowed "wisdom" upon countless lowly beings in countless worlds.

One of the three oldest \[Demon Lords\] of the Demon World.

A Goddess of Evil, who bestowed wisdom on fragile creatures and nurtured them with kindness, and who has destroyed countless worlds at her whim with the same smile.

The "Creator God" who created the world and the destructive demon who destroyed the world.

The magical aura mixed with demonic energy emitted by Sylberthal, the \[Mad Princess\], spoke more clearly to the opposing demons than her words.

"Are you not regretful as subordinates, having your master destroyed so pointlessly?"

In response to Sylberthal's provocation, four enormous magical powers erupted from the border. 

The magical power and demonic energy of the four servants who had become the highest-ranking \[Demon Lords\] covered the heavens and the earth, and humans who were anxiously looking up at the sky, wondering what had happened, began to go mad with fear, especially those with weak magical powers and willpower, until even their bodies disappeared.

Hearing the wails of resentment from the humans that were welling up from all over the Holy Church Nation, Sylberthal narrowed her eyes pleasantly, as if she had heard a good piece of music unexpectedly.

"Hmm. It's always good to listen to."

Rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble!

A knight in armor with a human-shaped upper body and a horse's lower body approached, leaving even sound behind as she covered the sky with dark clouds of demonic energy, and a thunderous roar echoed through the capital.

"Sylberthal――――!!!"

"You've come."

Gagan!

Nia, who was armed with a long, true iron spear, charged forward, and the tip of the spear sparked violently against Sylberthal's outstretched white palm. Nia, whose spearhead was chipped away, was knocked back along with the spear.

"You're faster than Neige. How about becoming my child?"

"Don't mess with me!!!"

Throwing away the broken long spear, she spat out a long sword of true iron from her mouth and struck Sylberthal's face with the sword wrapped in hellfire.

Gakin!

But even that blow, as swift as a swallow, was lightly deflected by Sylberthal's fingertip, whose hand then struck out at Nia.

"...Ho?"

Sylberthal's hand blade cut through nothing but air. There was no way Nia could dodge at that timing. If so, then someone else must have done it...

"Nia-chan, you're cutting in line."

"...Sorry."

That voice came from behind Sylberthal.

As Sylberthal looked back with amusement, she saw a figure wearing a jester's mask that hid half of her face and a mini-dress modeled after a yellow pumpkin.

The demon who had saved Nia by teleporting without Sylberthal noticing must have been Fannie, one of Yurushia's four servants.

"I'm going!"

Fannie's figure disappeared from beside Nia, and hundreds of Fannies appeared all at once and launched an attack.

"Marvelous... but"

An illusion that even Sylberthal's eyes couldn't see through instantly. All of those magical attacks were real, and if she were to take a direct hit, even Sylberthal wouldn't be able to escape unscathed.

But at that moment, hundreds of stone pillars that had grown from the ground, destroying the city, pierced through Fannie's illusion, and the magical shockwave that Sylberthal had fired into the empty space blew away the hidden Fannie.

"Loyalty is a troublesome thing. There's a bit of anger leaking out."

Fannie was completely destroyed with just one blow, and Sylberthal followed up with a magical shock.

"Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!"

Nia intervened, holding up her shield to block the magical shockwave.

The ability to absorb and the giant true iron shield collided with Sylberthal's magic, creating a violent shockwave that caused the cityscape directly below to be ground into a crater along with the humans in the blink of an eye.

"...Damn it"

A crack appeared in the true iron shield, and Nia made a pained expression.

But at that moment—

Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom!!

"Ho ho"

Sylberthal let out a voice of admiration.

An unnatural shadow appeared on Nia floating in the sky, and the demonic energy that gushed out from it deflected the swirling shockwave upwards.

"Noah!"

"...As expected, I can’t take advantage of any openings."

A young man with two horns wearing a military uniform-like outfit oozed out from Nia's shadow. Just as Nia had suddenly appeared under Noah, Noah had also used the attributes of twins to connect shadows and hide in order to take advantage of Sylberthal's gap, but Sylberthal was not someone who could be held back.

"Haah!!"

Nia used her \[Absorption\] ability to transform the magical power of Sylberthal she had absorbed into a huge vortex of magical power and released it with Noah's \[Release\] ability.

The strongest shield and the strongest spear. If they were two separate existences, it would only be a contradiction, but if they were one existence with two sides, it would no longer be a "contradiction."

"Hoho... is that the power that destroyed Etincelle?"

Even so, Sylberthal's composure did not waver.

Etincelle, who had been "designed" by Sylberthal, was a \[Demon Lord\] adjusted to be able to exert a certain level of power as soon as she evolved. Although she seemed to have evolved unexpectedly in an uncertain manner, she still had the ability to easily destroy someone like Hiraines.

The higher the magical powers, the more time it takes to finish a battle.

If their abilities were evenly matched, it would take even more time. Even the battle between Yurushia and Hiraines had taken half a year, and if Sylberthal had fought with the other three oldest pillars, it would have taken hundreds of years to reach a conclusion.

Neither Noah nor Nia could match the evolved Etincelle. However, the fact that Etincelle had been easily destroyed before Sylberthal's return meant that the two of them could demonstrate a higher level of ability by fighting together.

"I'll take it."

Sylberthal changed her focus from "play" to "battle" for the first time, releasing her magical power from her left arm like a net and entangling the twins' magical power.

"I'll return it."

Sylberthal forcefully threw back the entangled magical power.

The reason Sylberthal had changed her focus to battle was that the twins' attack was simply that strong.

Even so, Sylberthal merely became slightly serious and repelled it, and the vortex of returned magical power accurately attacked the three demons, and Noah and Nia blocked it in order to protect Fannie, who had not yet recovered enough to teleport.

"Ugh!"

The forces were evenly matched. The inability to withstand the force that should have been able to be withstood was due to the fact that Nia had also not fully recovered from the damage she had received from Sylberthal.

"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

A maid demon who jumped in from the side forcefully knocked away the competing magical power.

"Hmph!"

The blonde maid demon, who had barged in with rough breathing, noticed her tattered maid uniform and repaired it with her own hair, smoothing her snake-like locks, before suddenly turning to her companions with a serious expression.

"Isn't it cruel to start before me?"

"Tina-chan..."

Seeing her trying to maintain her dignity and appearance as the head maid, Fannie smiled wryly, witnessing the same "regrettable" side of her as before.

"Behave yourself."

Tina's magical power and hair grew, repairing the costumes of her three companions, and it seemed that a special ability had also been added, as the three's magical power recovered enough to move.

"Marvelous."

Sylberthal, who had been watching the scene without pursuing it, offered words of praise.

Noticing that, the four demons tensed up and assumed a wary stance, and Sylberthal's smile deepened.

"I'm not talking about you. I'm praising Yurushia's demonic nature, which she used to instill unwavering loyalty in you and allow you to evolve even if she were to disappear. Hohoho, it's strange, isn't it? Born with a human consciousness, Yurushia is the demon closest to me of all in the Demon World. The 'malice' of the people in that world is immeasurable."

The worst demon born with human knowledge and "malice."

How many astronomical probabilities would it take for such a being to be born? A human with strong malice would simply become a pure demon and lose their memories. If a person's consciousness was too strong, they would not be able to endure the nature of a demon and their heart would die.

Although she was pure, she despaired at the thought of death, but she still stubbornly refused to let go of herself and struggled to hang on to life, and was reborn as a devil as her "sin."

In short, from Sylberthal’s perspective, Yurushia's true nature was that of someone who was too selfish to be corrupted by a demon, yet was still strong-willed and maintained her own self-control.

"......"

While listening to those words, Noah was devising a strategy.

Sylberthal still hadn't noticed Yurushia's resurrection. Or rather, even if she had noticed, she thought it would take a long time to return from the abyss.

Their task was to use up as much of Sylberthal’s power as possible before their master returned. They had evolved for that purpose, but even if they had become equals, there was an overwhelming difference in that power.

To use an analogy, they were like students who had just become adults, while Sylberthal was like a soldier who had been fighting for many years.

Compared to their previous selves who were mere infants, they still had a chance of winning, but if they were to fight properly, there was a "grown-up" like Sylberthal who could fight.

Noah glanced at Rinne, who was sewn to the stone pillar.

It was unclear whether she had failed to defeat Rinne or was simply unable to, but Rinne's will to fight remained unbroken as he continued to growl at Sylberthal.

Could he use his \[Release\] to forcibly restore Rinne's magical power? As he was about to act immediately with that thought, Sylberthal's magical power was directed at him.

"Do you think I would allow such a thing? That is a 'sacrifice' to call Yurushia. Not for children such as you to touch."

"..."

Sylberthal was aware of Yurushia's resurrection. And even though she was aware of it, she even offered to sacrifice one of the highest-ranking demons in order to summon her quickly.

"The entertainment will continue until Yurushia returns. Let's have fun until then."

As Sylberthal declared so, she turned her hand towards the four with a pleasant expression.

From a distance, a voice rang out.

'Sylberthal-samaaaaaaaaaaa!!!'

Approaching from the distant sky were several Arch Demons and thousands of Chimeras.

At the forefront, fighting as they flew, were not demons under Sylberthal's command, but the rabbit and bear plushies, Arch Demons under Yurushia's command.

"..."

Seeing that, Sylberthal frowned as if her interest had been dampened.

Those Arch Demons were demons who had plotted to take the place of Etincelle and her subordinates, and they must have rushed over when they saw that Sylberthal had returned and was in a superior position.

Sylberthal was magnanimous, but she had no taste for keeping incompetent people who could not even defeat rabbit and bear plushies.

It was no different from doing it herself if she were to use incompetents. For a demon like Sylberthal, how much effort would it take to destroy a world?

"Hmm"

Sylberthal touched her shapely lips with her fingertips and pretended to ponder for a moment, before breaking out into a bright smile.

"I wouldn't mind a rematch with Yurushia even in a ruined world."

Saying so, she raised her left hand to the sky and called out a name as if singing.

"Come forth, \[Yaomatobi\]"

'''''"--!!'''''"

The overwhelming spiritual power of the \[Light Spirit King\] that appeared behind Sylberthal stopped the demons in their tracks as if they were bound, and Sylberthal watched the scene with calm eyes, giving an order to the Spirit King who had become her minion.

"Now then, as promised, let's try erasing the 'night' from this world."
