# Chapter 4: Everyday Life in the Abyss

A refreshingly stagnant air. An atmosphere so desolate it was almost ominous. From the purplish earth, poisonous enough to curdle your blood, a leech about the size of a cute squirrel said hello. I couldn't help but smile and squashed it with the sole of my shoe.

Yurushia here, on another spirited journey through \[The Abyss\] today.

"Well, that's just your imagination, Yurushia."

A blue weasel with narrowed eyes offered a dry comment.

I know, Rose. Since \[The Abyss\] has no form, it's ultimately just a visualization of my imagination. But it's also based on the common perception of most demons, so it's not that different from you.

That's beside the point, but Rose. It's good that our master-servant contract changed your way of addressing me, but why do you still hesitate when adding 'sama'? ... Oh, are you embarrassed? I'm sorry I didn't notice.

I couldn't help but grin as I looked at Rose, but she turned away with a pout.

"Oh well. Anyway, what was that thing I just stepped on?"

"So careless... And you squashed it without knowing what it was? ... I think it was probably a piece of a shattered soul. Even if you hadn't squashed it, it would have eventually been absorbed into the space and become a part of this place."

"So I don't need to worry about it?"

"Well... I guess not."

Here in \[The Abyss\], the souls that fall into this world are so impure that even the Great Spirit who controls the reincarnation of souls says, "There's no way to purify these."

The souls that fall often come down in the state they were in at death, and in the case of demons, most of them are already torn to shreds, so that's not a problem, but in the case of humans, they often fall in their original form, so they're ground up by the whirlwinds that occur everywhere and sent to the demon world as demonic souls.

"By the way, I heard that the souls of knights who are beheaded, especially the brave ones, are taken to the fairy world to become Dullahan."

"Oh..."

...Who would do that? To snatch away souls that would fall into \[The Abyss\], there must be a fairy king in the fairy world, just like the spirit king, right?

Speaking of which…

"Hey, Rose. Sylberthal called that 'Light Spirit King' her subordinate, do you know anything about it?"

Sylberthal had given the Light Spirit King the name "Yaomatobi" and subjugated it.

The Spirit King is one of the six most powerful beings that existed from the moment the world was created, and nominally, they are on the same level as me, the highest-ranking demon, but there is a clear difference. It's normally impossible for even someone as powerful as Sylberthal to subjugate something like that.

"...I don't know. Honestly. If the legend is true, he should be stronger than Sylberthal. One of the oldest subordinates, Etincelle, might know."

"Etincelle... is that the red-haired maid? Certainly, even among those maids, the red-haired and silver-haired ones were on a different level."

"Etincelle is a demon who has lived for countless years. I think she's older than Hiraines, whom Yurushia defeated. Neige... the silver-haired one is also insanely powerful, but there was a rumor that Sylberthal was stopping Etincelle's evolution in order to make her a \[Demon Lord\] in the worst possible state."

For demons, the worst condition is actually the best. If such an existence became a \[Demon Lord\], she might even become as strong as me. That would be a pain...

Speaking of that Hira...whatever...who was it again?

"Anyway, I don't know how to control a being like a Spirit King, who is, in a way, 'above God'. But..."

"Yeah..."

Sylberthal could have easily defeated me even as I was, but she used \[Yaomatobi\] specifically to instill despair and fear in me, a demon, and to devour those emotions.

But thanks to \[Yaomatobi\] creating a hole in the bottom of Sylberthal's unique subspace, "Hell's Gate", Rose and I were able to barely escape and regenerate.

The Light Spirit King probably isn't completely under her control yet. Maybe that's the key to turning the tables.

"Well, whatever happens, happens, so there's no point in worrying about it."

"Sigh... I wonder if I rushed into serving you after all..."

How serious of you. It reminds me of Mylene. Is it a compliment to say that a demon is more sensible than a Great Vampire? In reality, the world runs on the hard work of sensible people, so I hope Rose will do her best.

As I walked with that thought in mind, I heard what sounded like sutras from somewhere in the distance.

"What's that?"

"Huh? ... Oh, it's probably a demon worshiper? They must have done something really bad to end up in \[The Abyss\]. But it's so ridiculous. To ask a demon to grant their wishes by offering the lives of others, as if anything but their own souls could be a worthy sacrifice."

Rose climbed onto my shoulder, which was only about a meter tall, and looked into the distance with a mocking smile.

Well, that's true. There are often stories about demons, like the one about a king who tried to save his country by sacrificing his daughter. If I were in that situation, I'd probably talk to the daughter and encourage her to hate her father and the country, and then grant her that wish.

If you have a wish for a demon, you should have the guts to bet your own soul on it. Oh, and I'd say no thanks to the souls of people who say things like, "I want to sacrifice myself to save others" with a straight face. They're as greasy as pork lard.

As usual, I've gone off on a tangent. While I'm carrying Rose, who for some reason won't get off my shoulder, we come across a loud chanting sound... or is it a spell? And there's an old man in a robe praying at a shabby altar made of stacked rocks.

Hmm. A human. Since he's around here, I guess he's from Atra, but he's surprisingly well-preserved.

Both Rose and I have no interest in him, so we try to pass by, but he notices us and approaches with strange, shuffling steps.

"Oh, to come to this strange land and meet such a lovely young lady after so many years, what a joy! How about a cup of tea?"

"......"

Where in this scenery is there any tea? And despite that grandfatherly smile, I have no interest in drinking tea with that guy with those dull yellow eyes. And did he say "years"? It's a miracle he wasn't caught in a whirlwind all this time.

Ignoring him, I tried to move on, but the man hurried in front of us.

"Wee hee hee! So you've finally discovered my plan! I am Baron Heden, the ultimate summoner of demons in the Holy Kingdom! Be a good demon sacrifice!"

"......"

So you're from the Holy Kingdom. This world is small after all... To avoid any trouble, I let out a demonic aura, and this guy named Hayden looked startled and immediately prostrated himself.

“Ohhh, could it be that the Demon Lord has graced us with their presence?! After decades of hardship, my wish is finally granted! Please accept my loyalty—”

“Shut up.”

“Gugaya!”

He crawled towards me like a cockroach and tried to lick my shoe, so I kicked him away because it was disgusting. Since he weighed nothing, he flew several kilometers and was caught up in a tornado that happened to pass by and was blown to bits.

“...Maybe you could have eaten him to replenish your magic?”

"Well then, Rose, eat it."

“No way. A madman's soul tastes like nothing.”

Then don't offer it to me. I don't want it either.

Anyway, Rose says that according to her senses, there's a spring of souls a few days' journey from here, before the corrupted souls are ejected into the demon world.

There's no guarantee that we can safely enter the demon world even if we dive into it, and we might even end up in a different star system than Atra. But for now, it's our only hope, so we set off towards it.

"Hey..."

"Hm? Did we take a wrong turn?"

"No, it's that... that thing."

Following Rose's gaze, I looked up and saw a black dot in the murky sky... falling? It swirled through the air and crashed into the barren land, creating a crater.

The severed head of a dragon-man or something? And that aura... it's a high-ranking demon.

Out of curiosity, I approached it, and it seemed to still have some self-awareness. It was mumbling something and facing away from us.

I gently poked it with a sharp stone I found nearby, and it turned its head towards me in surprise.

"Ugh!? Who are you!? Hey, little lady, stop that!"

Apparently, my poking at its eyes and nose had finally annoyed it. Well, I wasn't going to stop. As if sensing my thoughts, Rose, perched on my shoulder, whispered into my ear.

"That's... Sorovel, one of Sylberthal's Arch Demons..."

"Oh, if it isn't the lovely \[Demon Scholar\] Rose! Please tell this little lady to stop poking me. Ow, ugh."

Hmm... so this guy is one of Sylberthal's subordinates. But why is an Arch Demon of Sylberthal in a place like this? I (still poking) looked at Rose, who understood and spoke to him.

"Sorovel... why are you in \[The Abyss\]?"

"Oh, would you listen to me, \[Demon Scholar\] Rose? I arrogantly defied the beautiful Sylberthal, and was executed by the \[Arch Demon\] Tina, the subordinate of that \[Devil\]"

My hand, which had been stabbing, stopped at those words.

"Even a demon like you was defeated...?"

"Hmph? N-no, of course it was a very close call. I wouldn't have lost under normal circumstances. That \[Arch Demon\] Tina had gone mad and was uncontrollable. For a proud Great Demon to go mad over losing her master... what a disgrace... gwah!?"

I gouged out Sorovel's eye with a stone, and his scream echoed through the Abyss.

"Tina... what about her?"

When I spoke quietly, Rose trembled and fell off my shoulder. Sorovel's remaining eye widened, and his face contorted in terror.

"...Impossible... Unbelievable... Why, why do you still have your self-awareness after fighting Lord Sylberthal?!"

"Enough. Spit it out."

"Grrrr?!"

I grabbed the severed head with my crimson claw and squeezed, and Sorovel let out a cry of agony.

Tina went mad? Because I was gone? But if Tina was sane, there's no way a low-level demon like this would have fallen while still retaining his self-awareness.

"What about Tina? What happened to everyone? What about Rinne?"

"O-oh, you bastard \[Demon Princess\] Yurushia! They're all finished! Etincelle and the other attendants are going to eliminate them! That \[Dark Beast\] also challenged Lord Sylberthal, and by now, it's probably being torn apart in \[Hell's Gate\]! Arrrgghhhhh!"

My claw dug deeper, and Sorovel's skull cracked.

Everyone... Rinne... they’re probably doing something reckless again...

"..."

"W-what are you doing... stop..."

Sorovel's voice trembled as he realized what I was about to do. I bared my crimson fangs and tore open Sorovel's skull with my claws, then plunged my fangs in and devoured the demon core that made up his being.

"Stop it! Don't eat me! Stop it!"

After chewing half of him until his self-awareness disappeared, I tossed the rest to the trembling Rose and ordered her to eat it, looking down at her with black, demonic eyes.

"B-but..."

"Just eat it. We need to hurry."

Demons do eat their own kind, but it's usually only those they've defeated, so Rose instinctively disliked it. But I wouldn't choose my means to quickly regain my strength.

"Okay..."

Rose ate the rest hesitantly, and her form grew larger, evolving from a Lesser Demon to a Greater Demon.

"...Phew"

That was a bit unlike me. I had grown a bit, too, so I picked up the frightened Rose... She was too big to put on my shoulders, so I wrapped her around my neck like a scarf and stroked her head to soothe her, and Rose's face brightened up as if she was relieved.

"Now, let's go, Rose."

"Y-yes!"

—----

Author’s Note: Yuru had assumed that even if she disappeared, Rinne and Noah, who were calm and level-headed until her return, would keep everyone together and in hiding.

An unexpected complication was that due to falling into the Abyss, news of Yuru's revival had not reached them.

While she was initially worried about everyone, a hint of her demonic nature briefly surfaced, but she quickly calmed down. Yuru understands that if she doesn't act like herself, she won't be able to defeat Sylberthal. But perhaps that's simply her true nature.

Demons can be categorized into three main types: cruel, pleasure-seeking, and cold-hearted.

From these, they can further develop traits such as pride, greed, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth.

Yuru is a gluttonous demon who seeks pleasure, while Rinne was originally a wrathful demon but has now shifted towards greed.

In this recent incident, Yuru's wrathful demonic nature surfaced, but as she is primarily pleasure-seeking, she quickly returned to her usual self.
