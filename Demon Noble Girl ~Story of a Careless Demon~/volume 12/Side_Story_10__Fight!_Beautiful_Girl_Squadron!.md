# Side Story 10: Fight! Beautiful Girl Squadron!

In today's modern civilization, people have sacrificed many things, but humanity has reached its peak and established peace.

However, even in such a world, there are threats: Evil secret societies that would disrupt the peace, ancient empires emerging from the depths of the earth to terrorize people, and half-fish creatures appearing from ancient cities in the sea.

And —

"--What is this?"

That day, a girl sensed an evil presence appearing in this world.

Once again, this world was threatened by evil. The pink-haired girl, who was the first to sense the presence, stood up quickly in her school uniform.

"I must go immediately."

At that moment—

"Wait!"

"I won't let you face danger alone!"

"We're friends, aren't we?"

Three girls stood next to the pink-haired girl. A competitive-looking red-haired girl, a kind-looking blue-haired girl, and a tall green-haired girl all held out their hands to the pink-haired girl.

"Let's go!"

"""Yeah!"""

'Transform!'

But in this world, there were these girls. To protect the peace of this world, to defeat the enemy. The Beautiful Girl Squadron of this world.

"The Beautiful Girl Squadron, Cure Cure!"

Girls in colorful costumes with unusually short skirts, showing off their legs, soared into the sky.

"Look!"

The green-haired girl pointed to the sky, and from between the clouds, a giant "evil" was about to appear, distorting space.

"I'll do it, Ultimate Flame King Strike!"

The red-haired girl clasped her hands together and shot out a huge fireball. The fireball exploded in the distortion of space, sending up a flame a hundred meters high. 

However――

"Stand back, Absolute Rejection Water Wall!"

Sensing something, the blue-haired girl stepped forward and created a giant water shield. In an instant, the flames were blown away and attacked the girls.

"Kyaaa!?"

The Beautiful Girl Squadron screamed as the impact shook even the water shield.

Not only that, but the shock of the blown away flames destroyed the city below, the sight filling the green-haired girl with anger.

"How dare you! Destruction Thunder Emperor Strike!"

A giant thunderbolt was fired from the green-haired girl's hand and headed towards the distortion of space where smoke was still swirling.

However, the attack that should have definitely defeated the enemy was lightly blocked by the palm of a shadow-like girl's hand.

"No way..."

"Is that the enemy this time?"

A shadow of a long-haired girl and a tall man floating in the sky.

None of the attacks of the Beautiful Girl Squadron, who had always defeated any enemy that appeared, no matter what, were working.

It was probably the power of that "blonde girl" that allowed them to dodge their attacks.

Feeling the terrible power that was different from the previous enemies who had always appeared on Sunday mornings, the Beautiful Girl Squadron was intimidated.

"Everyone! Don't be weak-hearted! We've always won before!"

The pink-haired girl's words lifted the spirits of her companions.

They had won like this before. There were strong enemies. There were terrifying enemies. Everyone had used sweet words to deceive them, promising peace and friendship, but the Beautiful Girl Squadron had never been deceived by them, and instead had used it to their advantage and defeated their enemies without question.

"If we join our forces, we can surely win!"

"""Yeah!"""

Receiving the friendship and power of her companions, the pink-haired girl created a giant arrow of light on a giant bow.

"I won't forgive evil! Perish forever!"

The pink-haired girl fired the giant arrow of light at the blonde girl floating in the sky.

But...

At that moment, an intense rage was released from the man next to her, obliterating the arrow of light and blowing the Beautiful Girl Squadron far into the sky with enormous force.

＊＊＊

We went out together alone.

Although we are both very busy, we still manage to find time to enjoy going for walks with just the two of us.

"Wasn't Rinne busy?"

"Well, I was busy."

Rinne murmured at my words, glanced at me walking beside him, and smiled faintly.

Rinne does various jobs on my behalf as Queen.

I mean, the Queen's job is so varied that it's hard, you know? There's so much to do, like scouting for talented people. And don't forget those upper-level demons, former 'salarymen' who were so overworked they fell into the abyss. Even now, they're still looking for work, tightening the kelp around their necks, putting on their glasses, and working 25 hours a day. Even with all that, we still don't have enough people.

It's not that I'm running away from work and wandering around other worlds!

We're on a walk like this, but it's not in my country in Atra, but in an unfamiliar other world this time. After all, if the people were to find us walking around the country, it would cause a huge commotion.

Rinne—Rinrin, the dark one—

My guardian in the Demon World, the one who taught me how to live as a demon, the beast of the Demon World who, due to his long period of loneliness, became so obsessed with me that he tried to kill me and make me his.

But I gave him a "name" and made him mine, and we reconciled.

Now he is by my side as my husband, the Queen of a human country.

Having obtained the attributes of a human like me, Rinne acquired a human form.

He became a beautiful young man with dark skin in his mid-twenties, and he is very popular with the people. To be honest, some of the common people think he is the king.

It's not that I'm unpopular, you know? As a Queen, I am worshipped as a symbol of the nation.

It's just that... compared to Rinne, I'm a little smaller, or rather, a little girl, so I'm sometimes underestimated by the nobles of other countries.

Height...just under 170 centimeters.

It's not that I'm short for a woman. I'm twenty centimeters shorter than Rinne, so I look relatively small, and not only that, but my appearance... Wait, what? How many years has it been since I became Queen? My appearance is still somewhere between the ages of thirteen and fifteen, isn't it?

"Your body, Yurushia, has probably chosen that age as its 'optimum'."

"Oh..."

Rinne gave me an answer. Personally, I would prefer to be a little older to match Rinne, but in this area, there is no flexibility.

The devil's body chooses the "optimum". Well, like Tina and Fannie, there are times when it's flat or oversized, but there are no distortions; they become perfectly symmetrical, the eyes no longer look puffy, there are no wrinkles on the chin, the skin is always supple, and the hair is extraordinarily shiny.

That's us. Just walking through the streets attracts a lot of attention from the people around us... or so I thought.

"Those were strange children."

"That's right."

This is the first time we've come to this world, but as soon as we appeared, we were attacked.

"What?" I thought, but when I deflected the attack, they got angry because their city was destroyed by their own power, and they shot an arrow of light at me.

Of course that would make Rinne angry.

"Yurushia"

As the red rain began to fall lightly, Rinne called out to me.

"There's nothing to see anymore... shall we go back?"

"No... it's a bloody rain. Let's get wet."

Rinne took me into his cloak and we walked silently through the destroyed, deserted ruins of the city.

We came here to explore an unfamiliar city in another world, but it's also nice to just take a leisurely stroll like this, just the two of us.
