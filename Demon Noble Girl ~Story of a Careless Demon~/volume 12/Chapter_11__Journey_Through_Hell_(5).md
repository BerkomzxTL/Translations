# Chapter 11: Journey Through Hell (5)

"Hahaha! What do you say, Yurushia? So surprised and terrified you can't even speak! With the power of Lord Sylberthal, the oldest demon lord in the demon world, I will one day be resurrected and spread terror throughout the world again!"

I gazed at him with gentle eyes as "Hira-something," now skinny and with a hairy chest, puffed out his chest and laughed loudly, wearing only a loincloth.

"Yes, yes, I see. You're capable of doing great things, so please work hard and become a great person."

"…………"

"…………"

When I said that kindly, not only Hira something but also Rose fell silent with a strange expression.

"Sylberthal can be a bit harsh, but you'll be fine. Your grades are a bit low right now, but I'm sure you'll bounce back soon."

"…………"

"…………"

"That's right, I'll give you some pocket change for working so hard. Fufu... Keep it a secret from Sylberthal, okay?"

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! What are you!? Are you my grandmother!? What's with that line, like a grandmother comforting her grandson who's being pushed too hard by his educational mother!?"

When I took a copper coin out of my pocket, he knocked the coin out of my hand with the attitude of a rebellious teenage boy.

"Oh dear. Hira-chan is so energetic. You're too big for copper coins now, Hira-chan. Would a small silver coin be alright?"

"Who's Hira-chan!? It's not the amount that I have a problem with!!!"

I had given him a cute nickname so that Sylberthal would remember him, but for some reason, Hira something, who had suddenly entered his rebellious phase, was indignant.

"...Why are you angry?"

"Can't you understand!? Really, can't you understand!? Oh, that's right, that's right, you're the kind of person who never listened to others!"

"...Hmm."

I guess it's important to listen carefully to what children who are easily hurt have to say.

Thinking that this was probably what he meant, I turned to Rose, only to find her face pale as she silently shook her head.

"So, Hira-chan, what are you going to do now?"

"Don't call me Hira-chan, ...what?"

When I threw those words at the indignant Hira-chan, he looked momentarily stunned and let out a silly voice.

"N-no, I mean, I'm going to return to the mortal world with Lord Sylberthal's power..."

"Yeah, yeah, I see. But that's not important right now. Why aren't you trying to fight me even though you're supposed to hate me? I'm weakened to the point of being a little girl too, you know?"

"Eh? ...Eh?"

Hira-chan's eyes wavered with confusion as he processed my words.

"...B-but, even if demons fight each other in the Abyss, it's difficult to settle things, and if we fight to the death here and our souls are destroyed, we won't be able to revive..."

"Yeah, that's right. It's troublesome to try to defeat a demon here. Even if you cut it into pieces or grind it up, as long as your consciousness remains, you'll eventually revive. And to eat their core, you have to make your opponent surrender..."

"…………"

When I ate the Arch Demon that was under Sylberthal's command, he was terrified of me.

I had fought Sylberthal, whom even Hira-chan feared, and still retained my consciousness, so he was 'terrified' of me, even in my weakened state.

It is said that when a demon eats another demon that it has defeated, the soul becomes defenseless because the demon is afraid.

The guy in front of me was originally a very cunning demon. That's why, even though he said all those things, he was trying to make me fear him by using Sylberthal's name to outsmart me.

To measure whether he could win in a fight with me in his current state.

And to eat me after the fight.

"And Hira-chan, you're an Arch Demon too, aren't you? A Quasi-Arch Demon or something like that? Your power has recovered to that level, right? Why don't you fight?"

"You..."

The noble-like face that had been glaring at me momentarily revealed its true nature as a 'monkey face'.

"...Yurushia. Why did you fall into the Abyss? I can't believe that you, who fought me on equal terms, would lose to a mediocre enemy. A Demon Emperor? Or perhaps the Grand Duke of Immortality?"

"I've never heard those names before."

"Then what about..."

I wonder if it was another demon lord? The demon doctor who created Rose had been defeated by Rinne, who was a higher-ranking demon lord. As he pondered, unable to find the answer, I gave him a thin smile and told him the correct answer.

"Sylberthal."

"...What?"

Another dumbfounded voice came out, and Hira-chan's face contorted in shock, his eyes widening.

"You... You're lying!! How can you still have your sense of self after fighting her!? How can you even fight her!? She's a being on a completely different level than you or me!"

"Really, now... I didn't fight her recklessly. Most of my attacks didn't work, and even though I used my ultimate technique, I only managed to wound her a little and couldn't defeat her in the end. Moreover, Sylberthal's trump card was also extraordinary, and I was vaporized in an instant."

As I rubbed my shoulders as if to say, "Oh well," to myself, Hira-chan's face twisted.

"Are you out of your mind!?"

"Oh, what rude words."

Whether the original soul was human or not... no, because the original was 'human', I, who had eaten human souls as a demon, couldn't possibly be 'normal'.

With a gentle smile, I looked at him, and he, who was supposed to be a pure-blooded demon, chose a more conservative way of life and took a few steps back, his face covered in sweat.

"You... you're 'afraid' of me now, aren't you?"

"Ugh, shut up!!!"

He was flustered by my words, but this time he stepped back cautiously, a wry smile on his sweaty face.

"Don't get cocky, Yurushia! I'm also one of the demon lords. Don't think you can eat me just because you made me afraid once!"

Magic surged from him, much weaker than before, but he still stood facing me with his whole body filled with magic, showing the pride of a demon lord who was once called a god of the demon world.

To that, I gently reached out my hand.

Subduing a demon is not limited to violence alone. These days, demons have to use their 'heads' to survive.

"—'Let there be light'—"

"What!?"

He, who was bathed in the holy magic I cast, screamed in surprise, holding his arm that was exposed to the light, despite being a demon.

There is no pain from receiving this holy magic. However, this magic has a great 'curse' attached to it that can subdue even demons.

"The hair on my arm... it's gone!?"

"This is the ultimate permanent hair removal magic for beautiful skin! Once you touch this magic, you will never grow hair again for the rest of your life!"

"Hey, wait..."

I heard Rose's voice from behind, but I couldn't be bothered with that right now.

"Nooooooooo! Stop itttttt!!!"

With each successive holy magic spell I cast, the hair on his shins and armpits, exposed to the light, vanished, and when the precious chest hair he had cherished fell out, he finally screamed.

"Now, let's take care of that uselessly long hair of yours."

"Not this... I won't let you do this to meeeeeeeee!"

Hira-chan, clutching his head to protect his last remaining "unwanted hair" on his "head," ran out of the cave with a serious expression.

And I slowly followed him, as if drinking it in.

"Fufuf, where do you think you're going...? 'Ah'!"

My voice and Rose's voice, who had been following me, harmonized unintentionally.

Hira-chan, running away with his precious unwanted hair, looked like a man fighting a desperate battle to protect something important.

And then, as if to mercilessly play a cruel joke of fate, a tornado passed by, as if to say, "Excuse me," and swept Hira-chan away, tearing him to pieces.

"... Hira-chan protected what was important to him."

"...Is that all you have to say at this point?!"

Well, there were many things that happened, but maybe since he was a former demon lord, Sylberthal could probably revive him if she remembered. Probably.

Rose then muttered, "Why did we come all the way here?" and we remembered the purpose of our journey. While sorting through his belongings, we couldn't find any information about the magic essence spring that sends souls back to the demon world, but there was a piece of parchment (it didn't say sheep) with information about a location where he might have hidden something, suggesting that he had actually made a contract with Sylberthal.

"Rose, do you know about this?"

"No, I don't. ...But if even a former demon lord, who went out of his way to outwit Sylberthal, found something..."

"Yeah, let's go check it out."

So we changed our plans and headed there, and that's where we found something.
