# Side Story 11: Everything is for Her

Until then, "I" had nothing.

There must have been some meaning to my birth. At least, I believed that those I could call my parents thought so, and I wanted to believe that I was born to fulfill their wishes.

But... I had nothing. I just lived without thinking about anything.

I did nothing, and I lived only on instinct as a species... I never questioned or worried about the meaning of my existence, and I simply drifted through life, tossed about by the waves of the vast ocean.

But on that day... when I met 'her,' my life truly began.

I first became aware of her at a certain ramen shop.

Shall I say it's a typical... Well, the owner might be offended? It's an old-fashioned ramen shop in a downtown shopping district. It's not a shop for connoisseurs who use unique ingredients, but rather a ramen shop where local people and working people eat their daily meals.

It was just a coincidence that I was at that shop.

Far from my hometown, I had been living with my fellow countrymen, waiting to be consumed as part of society.

The gentle aroma of the soup that seemed to reflect the character of the owner... I'm sure she liked that nostalgic scent too.

It was because of that ramen shop, filled with such kindness, that I was able to meet her.

When I first met her, she was very young... no, I could even say she was still a child.

With a large schoolbag on her small body, she was looking at the ramen the owner had brought her with a curious expression.

Her eyes sparkled as she tasted the ramen for the first time. With her slightly exhaled breath, I felt my body heat up as if I had seen something I shouldn’t have, as if I had been boiled in a large pot.

One day, I had a very bad feeling. I had a premonition that she was in danger.

The shopping district where I met her was being redeveloped in a rather shady way. Because it was a shopping district loved by the locals, the company that was doing the redevelopment took direct action when the negotiations for money broke down.

Even so, the people of the shopping district, centered around the owner and young clerks, were united in opposing it. Of course, I, who had begun to feel a kind of attachment to this ramen shop, also did my best to help them behind the scenes.

However, fed up, they decided to take more direct action and, of all things, attempted to kidnap her.

She wasn't a resident of the shopping district, but she was loved by everyone there for her brightness and loveliness.

Due to my position, I was unable to talk to her directly, but I still tried to find a way to convey to her the danger she was facing... However, due to her young age, she fell into the cunning trap of adults and was taken away.

I was frantic. But I had no power as an individual. But my fellow countrymen who sympathized with my feelings lent me their strength.

We shared information and searched for her whereabouts. We were lucky to be able to track her down, but we couldn't do anything ourselves, and could only guide her friends, who also sensed the danger at the time.

We felt powerless. But she needed us, and she asked us to help her escape from the villains.

She had a mysterious power, and it was through that power that she called us.

We rallied and worked with her to eliminate the villains, and finally, together with her friends, we were able to rescue her.

But that was just the beginning. A much larger entity was targeting her.

She was so intelligent and pure, she probably didn't need my help. But I couldn't just sit back and watch. So, together with my fellow countrymen, I decided to help her friends, who would become her strength.

For the boy in her class who had a similar power to hers, we gathered the necessary items little by little and gave them to him without him noticing.

Her classmates were helping her senior, who had unique abilities, by making special meals to boost his powers.

However, the entity targeting her enlisted the help of a girl behaving strangely in an attempt to eliminate her.

Perhaps as a result of this, she grew weaker day by day. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the entity set its sights on the boy in her class. The boy was about to succumb to the psychological pressure. We did our best to support him, but our efforts were in vain, and she was killed by a fatal blow in the midst of the conflict.

We were heartbroken. The grief of the boys who were close to her must have been immeasurable. But they didn't give up. They started to act, clinging to a small hope.

Inspired by their courage, we also regained our strength and decided to help them, even if they didn't know we existed.

Time passed, and finally she came back to us.

She joined forces with the grown-up boys and drove away the great entity, rewarding all of us who had fought in secret until then.

But... she left us.

Perhaps our place was too small for her. She had a great influence on many people and left, and people began a new life.

But... I couldn't bear not having her. Together with my fellow countrymen who felt the same way, I decided to chase after her.

We traveled to many places, just going with the flow.

Along the way, we met a maid who was associated with her, and even helped a shop owner, who was an acquaintance of the maid, return to the sea.

And so a long time passed... and finally, I reached her.

Wiggle wiggle wiggle…

"......"

What should I do when the seaweed salad served at the castle seems to be telling me a story like that using gestures...?

What? Do you have a will? Are you an individual? Are you a colony? Did you follow us from Earth to Atra? How did you cross dimensions? Did you reincarnate from one seaweed to another?

No way, could my miasma from when I was Yuzu have given the seaweed a sense of self? I didn't think so...

No, I knew I had a high affinity with seafood… but I thought they were just unusually cooperative. You don't think I was actually thinking that, do you?

Moreover, while Yuzu was gone, you were supplying mana to Yuuki-kun and Onza-kun, or something like that. I kind of feel bad!

"...Tina. Give this salad to Onza-kun."

"As you wish."

Tina walked away with the salad without changing her expression, and something was wriggling from the tray she was carrying, protesting, but I’m not seeing anything!

"With great power comes great responsibility."

"Is that so?"

I nodded at Fannie, who tilted her head curiously beside me, and narrowed my eyes at the sunset visible from the terrace.

Let's be careful about giving too much power to seafood…
