# Chapter 7: Journey Through Hell (1)

Apparently, my children are causing a ruckus in the mortal realm because I'm gone. Since they had such a strong connection to me, they must be in a lot of turmoil...

To be honest, I'm not too worried about Geas or Onza, who are much weaker than my four main attendants.

Geas is much smarter than an ordinary demon, and above all, he knows his own strength, so he won't do anything reckless.

I'm a little worried that Onza might do something reckless, but no matter how you look at it, he has a track record of persevering for nearly 20 years to save the dead Yuzu, so even if he panics just because he can't get in touch with me, I can guarantee that he won't go completely crazy.

In other words, because those two are reincarnations with human experiences, they must be continuing a guerrilla-style fight, believing in my survival.

...Actually, I assumed that everyone would do that, but it seems that Rinne, who was supposed to lead them, was the first to pick a fight with Sylberthal.

I underestimated the ferocity of the demonic beasts...

I've been so relaxed lately that I've become quite careless.

Even so, Since it’s Rinne, I don’t think he’ll lose easily, even if his opponent is Sylberthal. It would be bad if Sylberthal used the spirit king of light, but Sylberthal has an uncontrollable habit of "playing around," so unless Rinne tries really hard to corner her, I think it will take several months to reach a conclusion.

To think that the key to continuing the operation is trusting Sylberthal's 'strength' and 'arrogance'... I'm in quite a desperate situation.

But my four attendants are different.

They have overwhelmingly less experience as demons.

It usually takes at least a hundred years to evolve into an \[Arch Demon\]. However, as a result of me doting on them, they evolved into \[Arch Demons\] in no time at all.

In other words, I suspect they are in a childlike state, venting their frustrations by causing trouble because they lack life experience.

“I think they won’t lose, even if they lose their sanity, as long as it's not against Etincelle and the other attendants. If anything, it's like they've been unchained. They were pretending to be something they weren't.”

‘Huh? What do you mean?’

While on our journey to the \[Abyss\], the place where souls transformed into magical energy are sent to the demon world, Rose, the intellectual weasel, turned around to me and said this with a smug expression that was slightly irritating.

“You know how when \[Arch Demons\] who have evolved into humanoid form fight seriously, they reveal their ‘true nature’?”

“Yeah, right? The one where your skin turns a disgusting color and you grow horns and stuff”

“Disgusting? You should say it's demonic. Well, and the torn clothes covered in their demonic energy, which are completely different from their original costumes, become magical resistance equipment. That state is the maximum battle state of a normal \[Arch Demon\].”

“Huh?”

What are you trying to say? I've seen those kids show their true colors and fight many times.

“But you know, while the rabbit and the bear were pretty average, those four are definitely not normal. The other demons didn't seem to notice, but I felt like they were holding back while staying in humanoid form. ...What did Yurushia do to them?”

"N-nothing really..."

I averted my gaze from Rose's penetrating stare.

I had stuffed the information of famous ‘evil demons’ that I knew from my previous life into the demon cubs that Rinne had picked up, so that they could grow into magnificent demons.

I had pounded into their souls, as if singing a lullaby, the ‘extreme madness and terror of demons as seen by humans’ until their soul color changed.

That’s not a problem. ...It's still within the acceptable range, right?

Well, if there was a problem, it might be that the information I stuffed into them was about ‘legendary class demons’.

For example, with humans, you would have a heartwarming conversation like, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ ‘I want to be a firefighter.’ ‘I want to be a nurse.’ But instead of giving normal career information to infants, I said things like,

‘When you grow up, become the president of another country and take over the country,’ or,

‘Become a shadowy ruler who controls a large economic zone from behind the scenes.’

Thinking calmly about it, I realized that I had been recklessly giving them orders and brainwashing them.

"You see, I... was bored."

Rose fell silent, her face pale with sweat at my casual remark.

B-because back then I was in such a mental state, that Rinne was worried when I would suddenly run away from home, like, 'That guy is crazy.'

"S-so, if you noticed, why didn't you report it to Sylberthal?"

"If I told Sylberthal something like that, she'd definitely tell me to check it out myself! I don't want that. No way, I don't have any suicidal tendencies."

I changed the subject to avoid the issue, and Rose's eyes widened as she gasped.

Of course she would. There was almost twice the difference in power between her and the other Arch Demons. They would gladly dismember Rose (fact).

As we walked along, chatting casually and having a little argument, we heard a whooshing sound that gave us a sense of déjà vu. Something fell from the pitch-black sky and crashed into the ground a few dozen meters away, creating a crater.

"……"

We exchanged silent glances. We could have ignored it, but out of curiosity, we went to check it out. There were two very messed-up, demon-like creatures that looked like they had merged into a single slug because they were missing parts.

"...Those too?"

"Yeah... probably underlings of Nui, the insect-controlling maid."

Ah, yes, I remember that.

According to Rose, while Arch Demons evolve from Greater Demons, there's an intermediate stage called a "Quasi-Arch Demon".

It's easier to understand if you think of it as a "Quasi-Arch Demon" level.

If you consider evil dragons, Greater Demons, and Elder Liches that have existed for a thousand years to be the typical "Demon Lord" level, then Quasi-Arch Demons would be like "mid-bosses" in a game, the kind of opponents that a normal hero party could defeat with a bit of effort. (not my problem)

Incidentally, the Demon Lord I know is just a title (a hard worker) and isn't that strong.

But anyway, why did two Quasi-Arch Demons fall into the Abyss? Well, let's not dwell on it. Noel and Rick could probably defeat them, but if these guys are Sylberthal's minions, they were probably defeated by my children.

"Ugh, why did we lose, Apollo?"

"Yeah, Depol. She must have used some underhanded tactics."

"That's right, Apollo. Nui-sama also said that we were strong when we combined our forces."

"Yeah, Depol. Defeating us one by one is so cowardly, that stupid jester."

"But it was our luck that they didn't destroy our demon cores. Right, Apollo?"

"Yeah, Depol. Sylberthal-sama will rescue us from the Abyss."

"Then, Apollo, let's wait for her to pick us up at the place where the demonic energy gathers."

"Let's show her the strongest teamwork, even though we've merged, Depol."

"I'll go first, Apollo. Here I go!"

"Whoa, that's a bit fast, Depol. Here I go!"

"Don't pull me, Apollo. This is enough."

"Why are you going that way, you stupid Depol!"

"Because you're the slow one, Apollo!"

"You're the one who's clueless, Depol!"

"I've never liked you, you trash, Apollo!"

...Thanks for the explanation. Those two really don't get along. Well, you can't expect demons to be cooperative.

The only cooperative demons I know are the hard-working employees of my company who smile with bloodshot eyes 23 hours a day.

By the way, since they mentioned a jester, was it Fannie who did it? She seems to be in bad shape too, but I'll be back soon.

"tch"

I casually picked up a stone and threw it, luckily hitting the slug on its back.

"Gyah!?"

"W-what was that!?"

"Ah, it's Rose! Why are you doing something so cruel?"

"And... who's that weird kid?"

What do you mean, weird kid? Don't they know who I am? Normally, I thought higher-ranking demons would notice me on their own.

Anyway, that slug is disgusting. Since Nui was an insect-type demon, her subordinates are probably insect-type too. But is a slug an insect? Well, since demon classifications are so arbitrary, even birds or fish could be classified as 'beast-type,' and centipedes, spiders, and slugs could all be lumped together as 'insect-type.'

I had thrown the stone, but Rose looked at me with a 'what are we going to do now?' expression.

What should I do...? I'd like to pour salt on it if I had any, but unfortunately, even in our company that handles seafood, we don't have table salt for our products.

"Hmm."

Oh well. I'll have to make do with a salty taste. Thinking that, I decided to be health-conscious and sprinkled some magic-rich, demon-made, top-quality dried seaweed on the slug demon.

"W-what is this...?"

"Eek!?"

...Huh? The slug is starting to shrivel up. Oh, I see, the dried seaweed is absorbing the slug's moisture.

The slug demon screamed as it became increasingly slimy and was absorbed. When two magic cores rolled out of the slug, the seaweed stood up and respectfully offered the magic cores to us.

"Yurushia-sama, what are you doing creating demons in the Abyss!?"

Rose's scream echoed through the air.

Originally, the Abyss is a place where fallen evil souls are processed into the souls of demons, and it's not a place where you can completely skip that process and create new souls.

While Rose was going berserk over this unprecedented feat, the seaweed that had given us the magic cores bowed politely like a salesman and walked away to a distant wilderness.

"......It's okay. That's not a demon, it's a 'seaweed fairy'."

"That's all you have to say!?"

I'm sure he can live anywhere, no matter how tough the conditions. I can't help but hope for the seaweed fairy's future success.

Meeting... and parting...

Having overcome our sadness, Rose and I became a little more mature, and we continued our journey through the Abyss, sharing one magic core each.

But for some reason, Rose didn't talk to me for a while, looking sulky.

"...Hmm?"

"What's wrong?"

After a while, Rose seemed to have found something and climbed onto my head, standing on her hind legs to look into the distance.

"...Hey... is that a village?"

"Huh?"
