# Chapter 15: Tina Awakens (2)

"This is the end!"

The young, demonic girl with the appearance of a child exclaimed triumphantly, a sinister smile plastered on her face. 

Tina, the once-powerful demon who had lost her sanity and rampaged, was now pinned to the ground by the four demons. 

Though individually stronger than each of them, she had been overwhelmed by their coordinated attack.

The young demon, seemingly the most sadistic of the group, approached the motionless Tina with a twisted grin, ready to deliver the final blow. The other three demons - the man with dark glasses, the old man with a long white beard, and the seductive woman - watched from a distance with gleeful expressions.

“...”

Leyon observed them all with cold eyes. 

To her, Tina had been the most powerful demon under the demon god Yurushia, nearly equaling her own strength as one of Sylberthal's high-ranking subordinates. They shared many similarities, such as their cold personalities and aristocratic-looking golden hair, which had made Leyon instantly dislike her. 

The feeling was mutual. The moment the negotiations between Sylberthal and Yurushia broke down and the war began, Leyon and Tina had immediately become enemies. They had wanted nothing more than to kill each other.

Now, Tina, having lost her master, had abandoned her sanity and was being trampled by the four demons. 

Although Leyon wanted to settle this with her own hands, she ended up just watching from the sidelines.

As one of Sylberthal's closest subordinates, she understood the other demons' reasoning, even if she disagreed with their methods. They saw Tina as a threat who sought to replace them.

However, Leyon sensed something unnatural about Tina's current state. 

Even for someone who had lost their mind, was it possible for Tina to be so easily defeated? Her movements had become noticeably slower, and her magic had dwindled rapidly. Yet, she still retained her form, despite her magic seeming almost depleted.

Carefully scrutinizing Tina's magic, Leyon realized that it hadn't disappeared; it had simply contracted.

(…What is that?)

It felt like there was something different about that magical power. If she had to say what was different, it would be its "quality"... As the young demon child bared her fangs and approached, the magical power surged for a moment, causing Leyon to cry out.

"Get away from her!"

"Huh? What are you..."

Thud...

The young demon girl had instinctively turned around over her shoulder in response to the voice, but she stopped.

“...Wh…”

A golden snake leapt out from within Tina's battered body and pierced the young demon's heart.

"It's still moving!"

"Damn it!"

"Die!"

The three remaining demons attacked immediately, shattering Tina's remaining form into pieces. However――

"Ahhhhhhhh!"

The young, demonic girl clutched her chest in agony as a golden snake, severed from its main body, tried to burrow into her heart.

"Get rid of that snake!"

The man with dark glasses shouted as he lunged forward. But he was too late. The snake slithered into the girl's body, causing her demonic form to swell and burst like a boiling cauldron. In that instant, the golden snake's tail flung the man away.

"What?!"

Before them stood a colossal golden serpent, 10 meters long.

With blood-red eyes, it surveyed its surroundings before coiling around itself lazily. It devoured the core of the young demon, crushing it with its fangs.

"You bastard!"

The man with dark glasses, enraged by the loss of his companion, lunged forward.

"Stop it!"

The old man with the white beard tried to intervene, but before his voice could reach them, the man with dark glasses spewed black flames. The serpent's skin instantly rotted away, and in the next moment, it had shed its skin, growing even larger, eating the left half of the man's body.

"Get back!"

Seeing this, Leyon fired countless blades of light.

The serpent, its body torn to shreds, let out a sinister laugh. After devouring the core of the man with dark glasses, it shed its skin once more, transforming into a colossal serpent over a 100 meters long.

"...Tina"

Leyon watched the transformed Tina with caution. But the old man and the woman, having lost their companions, revealed their demonic natures, filled with hatred.

"You two stand back."

"We can't just leave after being tricked like this!"

"Her magic hasn't fully recovered yet! We can still defeat her!"

The old man, with goat-like horns, and the woman with bat-like wings attacked the serpent from both sides, wary of the giant snake.

"......"

Leyon watched silently... or, to be precise, she couldn't move.

As the two demons had said, Tina's magic was barely perceptible. However, Leyon felt a surge of intense magic deep within Tina, preventing her from moving.

"Die!"

The two Arch Demons unleashed a torrent of magic and demonic energy, attacking the serpent. Its body shattered and decayed as it shed its skin again. But instead of another serpent, an egg appeared.

"...An egg...?"

A blood-red egg emerged from the serpent's remains, and slowly, a golden-haired girl emerged from it.

The sky of the Sylber Kingdom, where there is supposed to be no night, suddenly turned dark and gloomy, casting a shadow.

The girl, who looked about fifteen years old, was of an unearthly beauty.

Her skin was as white as snow, her red eyes were dyed red all the way to the whites of her eyes, and she licked her cherry-colored lips with her bright red snake tongue.

The pure appearance of the young girl and her lascivious sensuality create a strange imbalance that could only be described as confusing.

But when one realized that the flowing golden hair that reached down to her feet was actually countless golden snakes, it was enough to drive anyone to insanity.

"Ugh..."

The moment the female Arch Demon became frightened, her feet turned to stone and before she could even scream, she turned into a statue and was shattered into pieces.

As Tina took a step forward, the earth and flowers that her bare white feet touched turned to stone, and the white-bearded old man jumped back for a moment, but was too late as he was turned to stone and shattered as well.

Tina, who was watching this with an emotionless face, ruffled her snake-like hair, and the golden snakes that covered her entire body turned black, and transformed into jet black chainmail, modeled after a maid's uniform, woven with fine chains.

"...\[Demon Lord\]..."

Leyon, the only one still floating in the air and avoiding being petrified, uttered the name of this being with awe.

"...Leyon..."

Finally noticing Leyon, Tina turned to her with a sinister smile that stretched all the way to her ears.

"...!"

Countless blades of light shot from Leyon's hair, attacking Tina. 

But Tina received them with a serene smile, remaining unscathed. She reached out and grabbed Leyon, and before Leyon could react, Tina's left arm pierced her heart.

"...Ti...na..."

Tina, with a twisted smile on her face, licked Leyon’s cheek with her snake-like tongue, devouring her fear and despair.

A few hours later, the entire region, forests and towns alike, had turned to stone, with every living creature petrified. From that desolate land, where all life had disappeared, a single Demon Lord flew off to the capital of the Sylber Kingdom’s royal capital.
