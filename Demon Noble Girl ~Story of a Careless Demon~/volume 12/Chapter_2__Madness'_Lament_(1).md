# Chapter 2: Madness' Lament (1)

The battle between the \[Devil\], Yurushia, and the \[demon lord\], Sylberthal, ended with Sylberthal’s victory due to a difference in power, showcasing the immense strength of the great demons that existed long before humanity.

Rinne, the supreme \[Demon Beast\] on Yurushia's side, had secretly colluded with Sylberthal to seal away the seed of the world’s destruction, the "True Demon Lord" and the factor of "Final Judgment" that dwelled within Yurushia. However, enraged by Sylberthal's broken promise, he now continues their battle in the \[Hellgate\], Sylberthal’s personal subspace. The immense shockwaves of their battle transcend dimensions, shaking the southern continent, including the Sylber Kingdom, and the frail humans prayed to God, fearing the end of the world.

However, the humans’ suffering had only just begun.

Yurushia’s demise sent shockwaves through her demon subordinates. Normally, when a higher-ranking demon perished, the demons created by that being would become free. Subjugating those demons at that time would allow one to absorb their power, but Yurushia’s subordinates were different.

Tens of thousands of special greater demons neither scattered nor went berserk, but instead stopped their activities as if wounded beasts hiding in the dark. The two Arch Demons, Onza and Geas, who possessed human attributes, continued to fight as Yurushia’s subordinates against Sylberthal’s forces.

However, the four pure demon followers who were closest to Yurushia, born and raised by her, went mad upon being freed.

“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa”

Like a child seeking its mother, like a child who had lost its mother, the children who could no longer feel their great mother’s love cried out for their ‘mother,’ and in their madness, they hated everything in this world.

Crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch...

There was a village in that place. A village where thirty-seven households, approximately 150 residents, lived. At this time of day, people should have been returning home from working in the fields, smoke should have been rising from the houses, and the only tavern in the village should have been bustling with preparations, but now only an uncanny atmosphere lingered.

A malevolent aura rose up, covering the village of the Sylber Kingdom, which was supposed to have no night, in dark clouds and turning it into a hopeless night.

The villagers were nowhere to be seen. Men, women, children, old people, hard workers, lazy people, good people, bad people—all 150 people who should have been living there had disappeared, replaced by a forest of strange stone pillars about waist-high, standing randomly throughout the village.

Crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch...

They were ‘legs’. Stone statues modeled after the lower halves of humans, of various sizes, from the waist, the base of the legs, above the knees, to just the ankles.

Why were there only the lower halves of the stone statues? Where had the upper halves gone? And to begin with... were they really stone statues?

Crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch...

A faint, whimpering cry could be heard. A voice calling out for God's salvation. But there was no ‘God’ to answer that voice.

Something piled up in the center of the village wriggled like a frightened insect.

Someone on top of it grabbed a part of it and tore it apart, and then a scream came from somewhere else.

It was a person who had been torn apart. Miserably torn apart, pulled apart, dismembered, yet... it was still alive.

Crunch!

The neatly arranged golden curls turned a dark red, and the once fish-white delicate hands cracked a muddy color, and with the distortion, the long black claws of its fingers grabbed the quivering organs and devoured what had once been a human.

A demonic curse. The soul melted into that flesh and blood was not allowed to die until it was devoured, and there was no peace for the soul.

Crackle.

"Were you expecting me, young lady?"

The sound of footsteps on earth, and a middle-aged noble soldier appeared, wearing a glittering high-ranking officer's uniform, twirling his gray Kaiser mustache with his finger.

Crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch... crunch...

Without reacting to the voice, the figure in a maid outfit continued to devour the entrails. Seeing this, the man raised one eyebrow in dissatisfaction and bowed politely with a relaxed gesture.

"Nice to meet you, beautiful Arch Demon. I am Sorovel, one of the Arch Demons under Queen Sylberthal. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

Even as the demon introduced himself so pompously, the figure in the maid outfit continued to devour the entrails, and Sorovel shrugged his shoulders in exasperation.

"It seems you're quite busy, young lady. ... I can't recruit such a mad dog into Sylberthal's ranks. It's a shame I found you, but there's no need to report it to Lady Flashblade. ... Tsk."

From the forest behind Sorovel, in response to his voice, nearly a hundred monstrous chimeras—creatures that were a mix of humans, demons, and spirits—appeared.

The mad demon before him was an existence almost equal to the four Arch Demons who were Sylberthal's close aides, and as an Arch Demon, she was stronger than the average Sorovel.

However, perhaps due to the loss of her master, the magical power he sensed had decreased to the level of a newborn Arch Demon, and even her intelligence seemed lacking. Sorovel judged that this maid demon was unnecessary for Sylberthal's army.

His original plan was to use a hundred chimeras to subdue her himself, but at this rate, there was no need for Sorovel to appear.

He had been ordered by Lady Flashblade, Leyon, to report immediately upon finding this maid demon, but Sorovel intended to make it his own achievement.

Even one of these chimeras had the power of a human hero. Sorovel smirked, stroking his Kaiser mustache, thinking that he could simply have the chimeras finish her off and offer only the remaining soul to his master.

"After all, she's just a subordinate of Yurushia who rose to power through mere luck..."

Whizz!

At that moment, hundreds of golden "lines" raced past Sorovel and pierced the hundred chimeras behind him.

“ゝé∞∬āヾゞ〃∬∂ěゞ〃∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞ〃♭éāě∮¬⊥⌅āě∞∬∂！！”

The bio-weapon chimeras, which were supposed to have no emotions, were pierced by hundreds of golden snakes, devoured from the inside, and let out terrified screams.

"...W-what...?"

Sorovel's smirking smile froze, and a large amount of sweat appeared on the demon's face, which was supposed to be incapable of sweating.

The magical power of the maid demon, which had been supposed to have decreased to the lowest level for an Arch Demon, began to rise rapidly, her limbs stretched several meters like spiders, and standing on four legs like an insect, she glared at Sorovel with blood-red eyes and thousands of snake-like hairs flowing.

"...Y-you..."

Enraged that he had faltered even slightly against a demon of equal rank, Sorovel's skin turned purple scales, and he glared with golden reptilian eyes, revealing his demonic nature.

He broke through the back of his military uniform, which had been weathered by his own magical power, and flew into the sky with huge bat wings.

"I won't forgive you... I won't forgive you! Die!!"

Boom!!!

The words he spat out became a curse, turning into a black hellfire that burned the maid demon and the human flesh scattered around her.

Hundreds of snakes on the maid demon's head burned in the hellfire, and the maid demon tore them apart and devoured them herself, while directing her petrifying gaze at Sorovel.

"Gulp!?"

The surrounding grass and trees instantly turned to stone. Seeing his left arm's scales turn to stone, Sorovel tore it off before the curse spread, and a golden snake, which appeared to be no more than a snake's attack, pierced one of Sorovel's wings.

Wings only made it easier to fly, and demons didn't necessarily need wings to float. However, Sorovel lost his balance due to the "weight" that was unbelievable for a mere snake's attack, and at that moment, the abnormally long arm grabbed Sorovel and slammed him into the stone-hard ground with such force that it cracked.

DOGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!

"Y-you...!"

Standing up, shaking off the stone debris, Sorovel regenerated his left arm with a furious cry, but after taking two steps, his legs stopped moving.

"What!?"

His legs from the knees down had turned to stone. In a panic, he tried to cut them off as he had done before, but his raised arm was grabbed by the maid demon's long arm, and the Gorgon demon bit into Sorovel's throat and was devoured by thousands of golden snakes.

"Damn you, damn you,... \[Demon Lord\]!!!"

Sorovel's body, which had been mutilated after having his demonic core eaten, turned into black dust and disappeared.

Even after Sorovel's demise, Tina continued to punch the spot where he had disappeared until a crater formed, and then she slowly raised her face and let out a wordless roar.

“....Al...jiza...ma...a..”

Chanting a mad and hateful song like a child seeking its mother, Tina ran towards the capital of the Sylber Kingdom.
