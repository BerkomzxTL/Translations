# Chapter 22: The Demon Princess

"Queen of the Night"—that's what Sylberthal called me.

That’s right... I didn't get absorbed by the Dark Spirit King, nor did I fuse with it. I devoured the "Dark Spirit King" and made its "power" my own.

I'm not a normal "demon."

Through various coincidences that could be called a prank of the gods, I became a demon with the attributes of a "human," one of the highest-ranking demons, a \[Devil\].

I fought Rinne, who had chased me from the Demon World, defeated one of the Demon Lords, repelled even the True God, a type of great god on Earth, and was eventually invaded by the \[True Demon Lord\], the "reset mechanism" that the \[World\] used to destroy everything and start over.

And then I was defeated by Sylberthal and fell into the Abyss, where I met the Dark Spirit King, the highest-ranking spirit, and by devouring it, I became \[Me\].

...Really, it was such a bad gamble that it really couldn’t even be called a gamble.

I think the probability of succeeding again, even if I did it a million times, is almost zero. That's how polar opposites demons and spirits are.

I think I succeeded because I was 'me'. I was a demon who cared about people. I had a human heart but devoured people. I wouldn’t hesitate to stain my heart with madness for that purpose. That's why the Spirit King was instinctively terrified and surrendered everything to me.

Spirits and demons are like red blood cells and white blood cells that are born into the world. An existence that possesses the power of both would be like a cancer cell that has appeared in the world.

Normally, this would have been a "disease" that the \[True Demon Lord\] had to destroy, but because of that... \[ I \] was separated from the "laws of the world" and the factors of the \[True Demon Lord\] lost their meaning and disappeared from within me.

No... I might now be a \[True Demon Lord\] with a will of my own...

A fusion of demon, human, and spirit.

The "Queen of the Night" is someone who rules over the "night" half of the world, yet is outside the laws of the world.

But even so, \[ I \] ――――

Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

Yaomatobi, the Light Spirit King behind Sylberthal, realizing my true nature, let out a sound like a tuning fork ringing in anger.

The light and dark spirits are opposites, twins, and identical existences.

That's why the Dark Spirit King had been sealed in the darkness and the Light Spirit King obeyed Sylberthal, but realizing that its other half had been devoured, Yaomatobi attacked me, trying to break free from Sylberthal, who had given it a name and controlled it.

"It's useless."

My power of "darkness" neutralized the vast light and heat emitted by Yaomatobi.

Before, I would have been easily destroyed by that alone. That's how furious Yaomatobi was. Even so, if it had been in perfect condition, it might have been able to fight me. But Yaomatobi, who had been sealed and cursed for a long time, couldn't defeat me, who had the same darkness.

I'll take care of you later....For now, just be quiet.

"——Let there be light in the dark night——"

At my "words," the "darkness" shone, and tens of thousands of pillars of darkness appeared in space, imprisoning Yaomatobi in a cage of darkness.

The current \[Me\] and Yaomatobi are of the same essence. While this same power cannot bind other Spirit Kings, a cage made of the same essence can easily confine Yaomatobi.

Gan!!

I met her downward swing with my own arm, and Sylberthal grinned.

It was a sudden attack, but I wouldn't call it cowardly.

Why wouldn't she attack? Why would she need to wait for a decisive moment? Why would she need to hesitate about harming others? In a sense, Sylberthal was the only demon allowed to behave freely in every way.

"This is fun, Yurushia!"

"Yes, it is."

We laughed while killing each other.

Sylberthal quickly discarded curses as ineffective, and launched physical attacks loaded with plenty of magical power.

Sylberthal's jet-black hair spread and flapped like wings, and her elegant blows were unusually heavy, and even when I blocked, each blow dug into my body.

My dark claws also dug into Sylberthal, chipping away at her existence.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"

Even in such a situation, Sylberthal laughed loudly.

Our arms clashed, and the shock shook the world. Her laughter reverberated throughout the world, announcing to the world the existence of the evil "demon" that could destroy this world.

I could see it... all over the world... in the Holy Kingdom, families and friends could feel the destruction of the world and were offering prayers to God.

But their prayers will not be answered. There is no convenient "God" in this world.

But \[ I \] will save you. \[ I \] will accept your prayers.

I'm not a "god" but...

Bang!!!

Perhaps due to the difference in experience of hundreds of thousands of years... since before the birth of humanity, my arms were flicked away, and Sylberthal's left arm was deeply pierced into my chest.

"What's wrong, Yurushia?! Have you become so weak that you can’t even act like a demon?"

Although I am a demon, I understood the feelings of people, obtained the power of the Dark Spirit King to rule the night, and even repelled the power of the True Demon Lord.

I'm no longer just a "demon". Is that why my "heart" has weakened? Sylberthal laughed at me.

But even so, \[ I \] ――――

Roar!!!

A beastly roar erupted from the depths of my throat.

That pure will to destroy shook even Sylberthal for a moment, and I sank my dark fangs into Sylberthal's throat, who had approached me "carelessly".

"Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

I bit into Sylberthal's neck, crunching through flesh and bone, and Sylberthal let out a cry of agony as she arched her back.

With her hand dagger withdrawn from my chest, Sylberthal took a slight step back, her eyes wide as she watched me crunch bone with a blood-stained mouth, her voice barely a rasp as she spoke through her torn throat.

"——Demon Princess——"

Yes— \[ I \] am me. No matter what I become, I am the \[Demon Princess\] Yurushia.

Time seemed to stop for a moment, and a faint smile appeared on Sylberthal's lips as she realized once again that I was "just a demon."

I am the first "enemy" she has faced in the same position as her after hundreds of thousands of years of waiting. Sylberthal would probably continue fighting like this for tens of thousands of years just to satisfy her own pleasure.

But I don't intend to put up with that.

'Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!'

At that moment, a dark shadow suddenly leapt in, roaring as it sunk its fangs into Sylberthal's medulla oblongata. (TN: lower part of the brain connecting to the spine)

"——You..."

Sylberthal murmured in a raspy voice and turned slightly, reflecting the dark beast in her black eyes.

The \[Dark Beast\] Rinne. Behind him were Onza, who had freed him, Geas, and the four attendants who had been protecting them from the aftermath of our battle.

It was all for this moment. To make Sylberthal focus all her attention on me, I had deliberately accepted close combat.

"GRRRRRRRRRRR!!!"

Rinne's enormous jaws tore a large chunk out of Sylberthal's medulla oblongata, the balance between us was upset, and my "darkness" began to erode her existence.

The time had finally come for Sylberthal, the ancient serpent that had existed for hundreds of thousands of years, the oldest Demon Lord who had created and destroyed countless worlds.

"...Fuhahaahaha!!! Well done, Yurushia. I commend you.

It's a pity to let it end like this... but I'll be back. It might take a few thousand... or tens of thousands of years, but what does it matter, it's just a nap to us. Until then, you can play with the countless worlds I've created as you please.

Farewell then. Play with me again, my beloved child... Yurushia——"

And with that, she disappeared into the darkness with a gentle, childlike smile on her face.

"...Goodbye, Sylberthal."

...Seriously?

Well, maybe with a few thousand years I could become a bit stronger...

“...Yurushia…”

"Rinne..."

Rinne, who was still mortally wounded even though his magical power had partially returned, shrank into the form of a black cat and nestled in my chest.

"You've done something reckless again…"

'...Only for you..'

"...Yeah"

I rubbed my cheek against Rinne, and his tongue licked my cheek lightly.

"Master!"

"Lady Yurushia!"

Although their bodies were obviously battered, my companions, who had understood my intentions and freed Rinne, all flew towards us.

"Master..."

"Ah, sorry."

I instinctively pushed Tina's face away as she tried to hug me with bloodshot eyes, and in that gap, Fannie took the opportunity to get behind me and hug me around the neck.

Even though these kids had become the highest-ranking demons, they hadn't changed at all, which somehow made me feel relieved.

"...Lady Yurushia"

"Yeah"

Noah called out to me, and as I nodded, Nia stepped forward with her shield ready.

It wasn’t like Sylberthal was destroyed and we lived happily ever after.

In a sense, this was the "beginning," and sensing the "presence," Rinne bared his fangs, and I stepped forward, protecting Geas, Onza, and Rose behind me.

The air changed.

The smell of decay mixed with the scent of the wind.

When the figure of Yaomatobi, who had been imprisoned in the dark cage, disappeared, the world changed, and before my eyes was the sight of my nostalgic homeland—the Demon World.

There were two \[Demon Lords\] there.

One of them was an armored, monkey-faced demon, a giant whose body was so large that its edges blurred like a mountain range.

The other was a demon-like boy, about ten years old, with soft, fluffy blond hair.

The boy smiled gently at me, and a bell-like sound escaped his lips.

"Hello, \[Demon Princess\]. It’s been a while, \[Legendary Beast\]. And to those who have become the new highest-ranking demons. I am \[Demon Emperor Lucifer\]. And he is——"

"——\[Demon Grand Duke Agares\]——"

A voice like thunder echoed from the giant demon.

\[Demon Emperor Lucifer\]

\[Demon Grand Duke Agares\]

Along with \[Mad Princess Sylberthal\], they were the three oldest Demon Lords who ruled the Demon World.

Incredible beings had appeared. Sensing our tension, the beautiful boy with platinum hair—\[Demon Emperor Lucifer\]—laughed cheerfully.

"Don't make such a scary face. I've just come because \[Demon Grand Duke Agares\] said he wanted to see your face. And it's also a 'declaration of war'."

\[Demon Emperor Lucifer\] spread twelve wings of light from his back and pointed at us.

"You defeated \[Mad Princess Sylberthal\], and you have several of the highest-ranking demons under your command. Your power has grown beyond the scope of one of the oldest three pillars, \[Mad Princess Sylberthal\], and we can no longer ignore it.

So we've decided to gather the remaining Demon Lords and their subordinates and oppose your forces.

It's a war. We've divided the Demon World in two. The stage is the Demon World and all the worlds in the material world.

Be proud. It's the first time in tens of thousands of years that the ‘oldest’ of us have joined forces."

\[Demon Emperor Lucifer\] said only what he wanted to say, and then waved his hand cutely and turned away.

"Well then, goodbye for now. Let's start when you're ready. \[Demon Grand Duke Agares\] seems to want to start right away, but since it'll be such a good game, we should enjoy it."

"——Let's meet again on the battlefield——"

\[Demon Grand Duke Agares\]’s sneering voice rang out and the two figures and their presence vanished, returning us to our original world.

””"......"””

They really were on another level. I think they probably just sent a video feed, but even just from that, I could feel a pressure equal to Sylberthal's.

"...Well, whatever."

There's nothing I can do about it. I knew I would have to fight them the moment I decided to fight Sylberthal.

Besides, since they're the kind of people who think tens of thousands of years is just the length of a nap, so it will probably take them hundreds of years to prepare, right?

Until then, we have to get as strong as possible and increase our forces.

"Come on, everyone. There's still some cleaning up to do."

For the time being, the crisis of the world's destruction has passed, and, although it may only be for a short time, we have finally gained a moment of peace.
