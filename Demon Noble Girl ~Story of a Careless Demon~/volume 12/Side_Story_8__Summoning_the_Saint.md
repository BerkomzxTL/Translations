# Side Story 8: Summoning the Saint

"The Saint must be banished."

In a certain country in another world, there is a beautiful forest of trees called jewel trees, a place beloved by countless spirits, and known as a scenic place where fairies frolic so close they can touch people.

People were allowed to cut down a small number of the excessive trees, with the permission of the spirits. These few trees were processed into crafts and decorations, sought after by many people, and brought great wealth to the country.

Crops grow well in this land, beloved by the spirits, and it attracted many tourists from other countries in search of beautiful nature, crafts, and the opportunity to interact with fairies.

But now, the country was  facing a crisis.

The jewel trees loved by the spirits. However, while the jewel tree shines beautifully when it receives the power of the spirits, it becomes ugly and rotten when exposed to miasma, and begins to emit toxins.

Every few hundred years, evil miasma would fill the forest, polluting the air, causing the fairies to hide, and destroying the crops.

In response to this crisis, the country summoned a "Saint" from another world to purify the miasma and prevent the jewel trees from being defiled.

Summoning a Saint... but it was no different from kidnapping a peaceful girl.

"My lady, this is a grave situation." 

“Yes, Tina, this will require my immediate attention.”

Tina, who had been investigating the situation up until now, said this with a serious look on her face, and I nodded in agreement.

Kira, the Saint summoned from another world—and more specifically, from that country known as the direct supplier of summoners, a place I was familiar with—was initially bewildered. But when the prince explained the situation, she decided to purify the miasma as a saint for the sake of this country. However...

"That prince is no good."

"Absolutely no good at all."

While eating a soul-infused chocolate parfait that Tina had made, we were indignant.

Although this country had the magic to summon a Saint, it did not have the magic to return the Saint to their original place of origin. Therefore, in this country, it was decided that the saint should be married to a member of the royal family and live happily ever after. But even though the prince, who was around the same age, had become her fiance, he neglected Kira and was secretly flirting with some other noble lady.

"Isn't that bad?"

"Yes, according to my research, it is."

In response to Fannie's leisurely question, Tina, who was now wearing a peculiar pair of glasses that somehow had sharp edges on both ends, answered confidently while looking at the tablet.

I didn't know this, but apparently, in some other world connected to that tablet, there were many stories about stupid kings and princes who summoned Saints and then neglected them, and it seemed to be a popular trend. ...What a terrifying world that must be.

"So, we're going to have Kira legally exiled from this country and make her happy in the neighboring country!"

"As expected, my lady." 

As I slammed my fork into a platter of fruits from the Jewel Tree Forest, Tina applauded enthusiastically, her expression unchanged.

It was fortunate that we were there at that time.

I, as the Queen with the responsibilities of governing the world as an evil god, had come to this world on vacation with my two maids, Tina and Fannie.

I'm not a child who needs to be constantly supervised, so it's not like I need  chaperones!

Well, there were other maids, but they were mostly Arch Demons, so the two Demon Lords, Tina and Fannie, had been dragged along with me because they could handle my actions.

It was true that the country was facing a serious crisis, but with me, an evil god, and two Demon Lord maids, there was nothing we couldn't do!

"Alright, Fannie, let's wrap this up."

"Yes, ma'am!"

Fannie, who had been munching on fluffy pancakes with me, stood up with a little bounce.

Though we looked like we were in our late teens, Fannie in particular had grown remarkably, and she would bounce whenever she moved.

What was that? Oh, right. She was bouncing around so much that the maids had started calling her a "Lovely Spider," just like that spoiled young lady they were obsessed with. But that's beside the point. Anyway, Tina, stop tearing your handkerchief."

"Lady Yurushia, I've finished!"

"That was fast!"

Fast? You could even say it was quick. It all happened in just a few seconds.

Fannie... you didn't warp spacetime just because you hate waiting, did you?

"Well, let's hear your report."

"That prince actually understood that the Saint was necessary for the country, so I just manipulated his dreams and made him exile Kira."

"R-Right..."

So the prince understood. Well, any normal person wouldn't go crazy and exile a Saint...

"But it's not good that he's neglecting Kira and secretly meeting with that noble lady."

"Exactly! That's right!"

Tina said with a smug look on her face, and I joined in. That's right! If a Saint is the prince's fiancee, he shouldn't be cheating.

"Well, you see, that noble lady was originally supposed to be the prince's fiancee, and she was going to do all the royal duties for Kira, who was supposed to be the second Queen... but Kira was jealous and mean to her."

"........."

I glanced at Tina after hearing Fannie's report, and she tilted her head curiously while looking at the tablet in her hand.

As if to add insult to injury, Fannie continued.

"That girl was trying to stop the prince from exiling Kira, so I manipulated her dreams too, making her agree to the exile."

"Ah... yes.."

I felt a momentary dizziness at this shocking new information (or rather, existing information).

Eh... so that girl was normal too? But, even so, if Kira felt so uncomfortable that she was harassing that noble lady, wasn't the exile a good thing in the end?

"Still, if Kira is happy..."

"Yeah. I just checked it out."

Fannie crushed a small, black orb, and the voice of a girl who sounded like Kira talking to herself started playing back.

"―That prince is so handsome, I thought I'd go out with him, but what's so good about such a meek woman? It's so annoying. And she cried to the prince just because I spilled a little tea on her, what a crybaby! But it's fine now. The prince of the neighboring country is also handsome, and he said they’ll make a Saint there too, so this country can just cry without me, ha ha ha―"

“"........."”

Tina and I looked down silently.

Even so, the source of the miasma was evil emotions, so the people of this country weren't entirely without fault!

"And by the way, about the cause of the miasma in this country, it seems that the Mad Princess used to come here for vacation every few hundred years, and that was the cause."

"Ah..."

 …I see? That's what happens when an evil god of that magnitude comes. So that's what caused this...

"Ha ha ha"

Fannie laughed heartily, and Tina and I smiled with strained faces.

"...Shall we go back?"

“"As you wish."”

I heard later that after we left, the jewel tree forest returned to normal immediately. Strange! (Blank stare)

And as for Kira, who went to the neighboring country, there was no miasma there, but it wasn't as prosperous as this country, and she had to go to different villages every day to pray for a bountiful harvest.

The villagers were so grateful! Good job, Kira! You're too busy to go back to the castle, but it can't be helped!

"It's hard to make people happy... ouch!?"

When I muttered that with a sense of deep thought, Rinne, who was working, gave me a flick on the forehead.
