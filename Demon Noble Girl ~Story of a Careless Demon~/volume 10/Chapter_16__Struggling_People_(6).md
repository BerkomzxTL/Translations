# Chapter 16: Struggling People (6)

“Ah, wait!”

“Don’t let her get away!”

The residents tried to chase after Ester, who was running away at an unbelievable speed, shouting unintelligible things, but the residents who were chasing her easily lost her, wondering how she could go so fast in her sloppy running style.

“Terrible, terrible, if I become queen, I can make everyone happy with this country’s money, why are you tormenting me?”

Ester’s \[everyone’s happiness\], which she exclaimed while running fast and making no sense at all, was really something that made no sense whatsoever, which was to party every day with the money of the nobles and royalty.

As long as she could give them \[happiness\], she didn’t care what happened to them after. It was their fault if they were unhappy from that point on, Ester thought without question.

Although Ester seemed to be getting away despite being cornered to this point, her uniform was shabby, her beautiful pink-blonde hair was messy, and there were scrapes and blood stains on her cheeks and knees from where she had bumped into things.

Ester’s current appearance was not as lovely as it once was, and even those who knew her would have a hard time immediately identifying her as a princess.

It was all the fault of that wicked young lady Yurushia. If only she weren’t there, the world would revolve around her, she thought…

“Why don’t you people understand!”

Ester ran around the Capital, avoiding the crowds, until she stopped in a deserted alley, breathing heavily.

“Oh, are you tired?”

“Hiiiiii!”

Suddenly, hearing a voice in her ear and a gentle rubbing of her cheek, Ester screamed and rolled away with her hand on her cheek.

“Na, na, what are you doing! No matter how cute I am, I don’t have such interests!”

“Don’t worry, I don’t either.”

Yurushia smiled as she squinted her eyes, staring at the blood from Ester’s cheek on her finger while muttering some unintelligible words.

The blood began to glow faintly, and in front of Ester, who stood up with a bad feeling, Yurushia licked off the blood with a charming gesture, not unlike Ester’s 13-year-old self, and finally licked her own lips.

“Hey, what are you doing!”

Where did Yurushia appear from? How did she catch up with her?

Ignoring these questions, Ester tried to let her emotions take over, but as she tried to move forward, she stumbled forward and was surprised to find that everything she possessed was gone.

“What the…?”

“Fufu. Thanks for the meal.”

Seeing Yurushia’s eyes glowing slightly red, Ester was terrified for the first time of the unfathomable existence of someone other than the Queen.

“No, no, iyaaaa!!”

With the last of her energy drained, Ester staggered back to her feet and escaped. Yurushia waves her hands at her, smiling.

Who was that thing? What did it want? Ester, not understanding what was going on, started running as fast as she could as usual, but without reaching her maximum speed, she stopped short of breath after 100 meters.

“Haaah, haaah…why…?”

For some reason, she couldn’t run well anymore. Ester thought that she must be getting tired because she had run quite a bit up to this point, and when she tried to stop the carriage that was running nearby using \[charm\], it almost ran over her and she hurriedly avoided it.

“Wha, that’s dangerous!”

“You’re the one who is dangerous! What the heck do you think you’re doing, jumping out of a moving carriage?”

Ester shouted back at him, and the people around her gave her a blank look.

“If I return to my country, I will definitely execute you! Idiot, idiot!!!!”

“Ah, wait a minute!”

She used her petite body to run around in the crowd, making a toddler fall over to stop the ones chasing her, and while she was stealing fruit from the stall and biting it, smiling as usual, she noticed a group of dozens of people chasing after me before she knew it.

“It’s not my fault!!!!”

Still accustomed to running away from unpleasant things, Ester, dizzy, made it to the mansion that the Sylber Kingdom was renting.

“It’s me, hurry up and open up!!!”

“…E, Ester-sama?”

Frustrated by the \[charm\] that for some reason didn’t activate, she entered the mansion to Chimera the remaining squires,

“Hey, Ester, Yurushia told me that you are coming back, but you really came this way.”

“Oh, Brother Axel!”

Axel was waiting for her in the entrance hall with a group of women under his command.

“Oh, brother! That Yurushia has killed my followers! The the Sylber Kingdom must raise a serious protest to the Holy Kingdom!”

“You’ve gone too far, Ester.”

As if to interrupt Ester’s words, Axel points his sword at his blood sister.

“I’ve already reported what you did to the authorities. I told you to avoid using that thing. I’m going to keep quiet about the existence of that thing, but you still have to pay a lot of money for it. If the Queen gives you to the Holy Kingdom as is, there will be trouble later, so she’s sending Rose over in a hurry to retrieve you.”

“Rose? Why that useless child?”

Rose was the youngest princess adopted by the Queen, the second princess, one step younger than Ester.

Ester’s impression of Rose was that she was a bit reserved, with little speech and expression, and her dark blue hair made a dark impression on Ester, and when they went out to parties together, Ester was the only one who came to the parties.

Even for Axel, the youngest sister was surprisingly unimpressive, and like her older brother, the first prince, he thinks that she cannot be an enemy in the struggle for the succession.

“I don’t know if Rose will be of any use to Yurushia, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to hide you until then, so just keep quiet and don’t do anything more.”

“Ah, but…”

Even if she went back to the Sylber Kingdom, she would be confined for the rest of her life. As Axel’s followers approach to catch Ester, Ester watched with alarm as they reach into their pockets and brace herself.

Zubibi!!!

“It’s terrible that you all torment me!!!!!!!”

“”””Ah”””

Tearfully biting a handkerchief, Ester fled again in a moment of dismay and ran towards the gate.

What was she going to do now that she had escaped? Ester, who had no such thoughts in her mind and just wanted to escape from the unpleasantness, was interrupted by a figure on a black horse appearing behind the gate.

“Oh, is that you, Sister Ester?”

“Rose?”

Rose, dressed in a female knight’s ceremonial dress and mounted on a horse, looked down at Ester with a cold gaze.

Even if Axel contacted the Sylber Kingdom a few days ago, it was too early for her to come. No, the trip itself could be shortened as much as possible with unlimited use of magic or magical tools if money was not an issue, but Ester glared at Rose for showing up here just in time as well as for feeling disrespected by her sister who had been making fun of her.

“My big sister is stupid.”

“What! Rose!”

Ester involuntarily stepped back as Rose dismounted from her horse and smiled a cold, doll-like smile.

Ester was surprised to see that Rose had such a beautiful face, but Rose quietly said,

“I have a message from the Queen.”

At that moment, Ester, sensing Axel’s followers chasing after her from behind, tried to escape through Rose’s side.

\*Dosa.

“…Eh? …Ah…”

Rose’s hand sword digs into Ester’s heart area and pulled out as if to take something from her, and Ester collapses like a puppet with broken strings.

“I don’t need you anymore.”

The last thing Ester saw in her eyes as her consciousness was enveloped in darkness was Rose’s demonic eyes, glowing crimson.
