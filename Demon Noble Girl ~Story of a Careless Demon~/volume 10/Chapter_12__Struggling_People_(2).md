# Chapter 12: Struggling People (2)

(Geas)

(Haah)

When I send a thought transmission to Geas, with whom I share a strong soul connection, Geas, who had understood me just then, disappeared as if melting in the wind, taking Onza-kun with him.

I underestimated Ester a little. I didn’t think she’d go this far, so I had Geas and the others check to see if she was up to anything else. Geas and the others couldn’t stop a hero who became serious anyway, and they were the most suitable people for a different job.

But still, how could Esther manipulate the hero who was an apostle of light, no matter how much of an ability skill he had?

“Come on, hero-sama, that person is a bad guy who is nesting in this country. Defeat her!”

“…”

Well, I wouldn’t deny that. I was a demon, after all.

“You guys, stay back. And don’t let anyone else near here.”

“”Yes.””

I ordered my followers to step back and turned to Noel, his face contorted in pain as he looked at me, as if he wasn’t completely in control.

“…Ry…shi…”

“Noel, is it painful? Just bear with it for a little bit, okay?”

“……shi…”

When I put on a big smile, Noel’s face, which had been pained, twitched.

“\[Be the penetrating light, the bright holy spear, Holy Lance\]…”

A spear of light about five meters long was immediately shot out, and Noel dodged it with his super reaction, but both Noel and Ester’s cronies were blown away by the aftermath alone.

“Oh, oh, you, what are you doing! That’s dangerous!”

“I went easy on you, you know?”

Ester-chan, who had fallen on her butt behind me, protested, so I had to defend myself just in case.

No matter how much I was a demon, I would never indiscriminately fire an annihilation spell at my friend Noel.

Since Noel was a hero of light, he would resist light magic, and since the heat is suppressed, even an ordinary human should only be able to barely notice the aftermath.

“–\[Light Go\]–“

I tried to cast holy magic on Noel, who was losing his stance after avoiding the luminous holy spear, just to be sure.

“…Guh.”

“I guess that doesn’t work after all…”

I tried applying a spirit-based disarming magic, but it was really troublesome, as expected of a hero. The resist rate of light magic was too high. It was like attacking a flame spirit with a flame-based attack, and most of them resist anything other than offensive stuff, regardless of power.

I guess I should just stun him quickly, as I had originally planned. Then, I think I would prefer the \[Night\] series, which damages the spirit, rather than the \[Bright Sacred\] series. But that one was all black and really looked villainous, so I didn’t think it would make a good impression to use in the academy…

“…Ooooooh!”

“Oops!”

I lightly avoided Noel’s attack as he came slashing at me with his sword.

“Hang in there for me, hero-sama!”

“…Ester, you’re bothering me.”

I lightly released a magic-only shockwave at Ester, who was making fun of me from the side, and it was blocked by Noel, who moved in an instant.

The attack from earlier was too poor to be considered Noel, but he seemed to be able to move normally when it came to protection and evasion.

…Ah, this was a bit difficult to do. I wanted to stun Noel and hunt down Ester as soon as possible, but I couldn’t fire a powerful magic because I felt Noel’s kindness even though he was being manipulated like this.

It was a side effect of being immersed in human society and becoming more like a human than a demon….

On the other hand, if I let Noah or Fannie do it, I doubt they would take it easy on Noel who once pointed his sword at me, even if it was unwillingly.

I brought them because I thought they could read the air in various ways, but in terms of their loyalty to me, they were the two who would hold the most grudge.

Even now, the two of them remained standing by with seemingly calm expressions on their faces as I told them, putting up a barrier to prevent ordinary people from entering this place, but I could catch a glimpse of the black, dark demonic fire burning in the depths of their eyes.

I had no choice…

“I have no choice but to attack Ester, huh?”

“…What?”

I declared smugly as I turned around, and Ester, who had been in full spectator mode, let out a dumb voice.

“–\[Light Go\]–“

I invoked the sacred magic, and thousands of light balls appear, giving off a weak shockwave that would only lightly strike the target if it hit…

“It’s going to hurt, so seriously avoid it, okay?”

“Kyaaaaaah!?”

I smiled smugly and thousands of balls of light flew toward Ester amidst the echoes of Ester’s screams.

This was not my original magic, but rather a riot control spell that I had learned in my sacred magic class. The teacher had us train being able to produce five of each, especially for women to learn for self-defense, but it had hardly been useful at all.

“Uaaah!”

Noel, who was manipulated to protect Ester, immediately slashed the light balls to make it disappear. As expected of Noel, more than a dozen light balls disappear at once.

“Gyaaa!”

Although only a hundred at a time, Ester was running away from the light balls that flew by without hitting Noel, and Noel was desperately trying to knock them down, but of course, even a hero could not handle the amount, and they gradually began to hit Ester.

If Ester was beaten up too much, even if she was a criminal, it would not be good for foreign relations if she was beaten up by the royal family of another country, so I would like her to give up quickly while there was little trauma to be seen.

Of course, if we detained her, I would take more than half of her soul before handing her over to the authorities, but that was a fair price to pay for what she did to Noel, wasn’t it?

“I’ll never forgive you for doing this to the future queen! \[Get up\]!”

Hmm? Was there another hidden trick? I mean, something was translated at the end, but it used some weird words, didn’t it?

\[Guaaah…ゝe∞∬? I don’t know…? ∂∂∂∂∂∂? ∮￢⊥? ∞∬∂!!!\]

“…e”

Suddenly, Ester’s entourage, which had collapsed, started to scream, and then it emitted a strange non-human voice and changed into an amphibian-like figure with scales and wings. This is…

“Chimera…”

That idiot easily did what I thought she would never do. Pushed too hard? But even an idiot could see that using this kind of thing would only strangle her later!

“Noah, Fannie!”

“”Yes!””

Anyway, change of plans. I couldn’t let such a bioweapon leave this place.

At the sound of my voice, my followers pulled out from subspace a ridiculously large weapon made of true iron.

It was the weapon we had prepared for Chimera since we first engaged in battle. It was a non-attribute destructive weapon that specializes in strength and uses plenty of souls (my treats), and if the Great Demons use it, it would turn into a weapon so vicious that it would crush even a senior spirit with a single blow.

But you guys should be a little more careful about how you look, especially Noah with his giant saw and Fannie with her spiked club.

Still, the power was impressive. Perhaps the lack of black armor might have made them weak on the strength side, but the two of them easily destroyed several of their opponents.

I wondered if it would only take a few minutes to finish them off, while using the light ball to keep Noel at a standstill. Just as I was thinking this, Fannie, who was always smiling, came to my side with a slight frown on her face.

“What’s wrong?”

“Well, it seems like Onza was attacked by Chimera in the distance.”

“What?”
