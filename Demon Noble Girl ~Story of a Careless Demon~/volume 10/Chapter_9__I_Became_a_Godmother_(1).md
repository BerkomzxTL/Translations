# Chapter 9: I Became a Godmother (1)

Fel informed me that Vio, who had come to Capital with my mother despite being pregnant, had suddenly gone into labor.

“Fuee, Fel, where is the doctor?”

“Yes, I’m calling for the birth priest and the midwife…”

I panicked, and Fel hurriedly answered.

Yes, that’s right. In this world, hospital-related matters were mostly substituted with sacred magic, so if something happened, we would either go to the church and pay an offering, or pay an offering and have a priest come to the church.

There were also alchemical potions using medicinal herbs and magic, but that one was more like a pharmacy than a hospital.

In a medieval-like world, medical care may be considered behind the times, but the lectures on sacred magic at the Institute of Magic include a study of the human body, and although there might be some limitations in terms of magical power, it would be possible to completely cure all but genetic problems in a day.

However, childbirth cases could be a bit tricky. Anyone with the same level of knowledge and magical power to heal the mother and baby could do it, but due to a change in the law a few years ago, becoming a birth-related priest requires one year of training under a midwife, and only women were allowed to participate in that training.

What a hassle. But necessary. So, the death rate from childbirth had actually decreased considerably, but the number of official Yuru-sama priestesses was low at the moment.

“Yuru-sama, let’s go to Vio.”

“But even if I go…”

Of course, I was not licensed, so I could not use sacred magic to heal Vio without a priest’s request. I mean, if I heal her with my ridiculous magic, I would not know what kind of effect it would have on the baby.

“When something happens, she will feel relieved if Yuru-sama is present.”

“I see.”

It was a little ticklish because I was rarely praised to my face.

“Vio!”

“Yuru-sama…”

Vio, who was lying on the bed in the spacious guest room while several maids were busy coming and going, as if her mother had done so, called my name with a pained voice.

“Yuru, come here.”

“Yes, mother.”

I turned to face my mother, who was by the bed, as she called me, and Vio smiled happily.

“It’s so reassuring to know that Yuru-sama is here.”

“Yes… Mother, how long has the priest been here?”

“I have sent someone to call them two hours ago, but according to the servant who came back on the way, there are many births today…”

The mother sighed in annoyance and put her hand on her cheek. It was one of our good points that we didn’t force our Ducal privilege’s forcefully to bring people in, but it was a hassle in situations such as this.

“Well then, should I go pick someone up, and-“

“No. If Yuru, the Saint-sama, goes, the church will be considerate and give priority to the priests, but the others will be in trouble. Besides, if something happens, I’m worried about not having Yuru around to heal me.”

“…”

I was going to bring them over with fast travel after a birth was over, but they said I was not allowed to move.

It was troubling. What should I do? To be honest, even now that I seemed to be getting more human-oriented, there was a part of me that felt like I didn’t care about anyone but the people around me, but my position was becoming a pain in the neck.

“Then I’ll go.”

“…Eh?”

It was Rinne who was holding Cyril in one arm who said those words.

“Rinne…but…”

“No problem. I’m of no use even if I’m here.”

“Ah, you know, I’m more than grateful that you can keep Cyril company.”

Rinne’s cheeks twitched as her mother said so.

“I’ll go, Geas, follow me.”

“Yes, Rinne-sama.”

Rinne declares again and hands me Cyril, who grabbed my shiny blonde hair and tugged. It kind of hurt, but not too much.

And so Rinne goes in my place, but…why would Rinne, a genuine demon, go that far with for a human?

\*

“- and, I think that’s what the young lady is thinking.”

“That fellow has a difficult personality.”

Rinne and Geas hastened to the church while having such a conversation. Although they were heading on foot instead of using a carriage, Rinne and Geas were moving quite fast while keeping their magic power as low as possible.

“Aside from those like me and Onza-dono who have left behind thoughts of their previous lives, why are Rinne-sama helping the humans?”

“I don’t care about the humans. I just don’t want to see Yurushia’s troubled face.”

“I see…”

Rinne answered simply, and Geas nodded quietly, wondering why she should care about a human baby.

Like Geas, Onza, and the four great demons raised by Yurushia, Rinne may have undergone some changes as a result of her involvement.

“Rinne-sama, this way is a shortcut for you.”

“This building? What’s in here?”

“Mylene-dono’s subordinates report that someone from the Sylber Kingdom is hiding in here, disguised as a merchant.”

“Then we have no problem. Let’s go, Geas.”

“yes. let’s go.”

\*

Geas, carrying a woman of about thirty with a red face, and Rinne returned surprisingly quickly.

“You didn’t force her to come with us, did you?”

“Of course not, My Lady. I approached her the moment she finished her work over there and asked her to come with me.”

“That’s right, Saint-sama, Geas-sama has done nothing wrong.”

“…Ah, ok.”

Geas was an old man, but for some reason he’s very popular with young women.

“Anyway, come here, Priestess. You seem to be in a lot of pain.”

“Yes, Saint-sama!”

I guess that was a relief for now. I was too awkward to help out, so I went out of the room.

“Is this enough, Yurushia?”

“Yes, thank you, Rinne, and thanks to Geas too.”

“Hohoho, no problem.”

A few minutes later. I think the baby should be born by now, but I couldn’t hear it. Then–

“Oh no, Yurushia-sama! According to the priest, the umbilical cord seems to be caught in her neck, and she’s not breathing properly!”

“What?”

I rushed into the room after hearing the maid’s story, and the female priestess was trying her best to revive the baby.

“Saint-sama, please heal the baby, I can’t do it by myself…”

“Yes, I understand.”

Come to think of it, I was stillborn when I was born, and Vio had been doing healing magic on me the whole time.

Vio was like my godparent who raised me, and she was a significant human to me. I would save this child of Vio’s.

“–\[Let there be healing light\]–“

Golden wings spread from my back and golden feathers danced around the room.

If there was even the slightest shred of life left, I would heal it from whatever state it was in. I would do my best with fifty percent more effort!

“Yuru-sama, the baby has come back to life!”

“Oh, Saint-sama!”

“It’s a healthy baby girl!”

“Yuru-sama… thank you so much.”

I finally felt at ease… what? What was that? There was some kind of golden light that was clinging to the baby and wouldn’t let go.

I could feel a kind of magical power that I didn’t expect from a baby…did I do something wrong?

As I was wondering what was wrong, Vio, who was holding the baby on the bed, called out to me.

“Yuru-sama, please name this baby.”

“Eh…ah, leave it to me.”

Something was bothering me, but it must have been my imagination.

As promised before, I would give her the name I’ve been thinking about. Let’s see, it was a girl, and she would be a diligent and hard-working child of Vio.

“Amelia.”

As I “named” her, an invisible power overflowed from me and covered Amelia’s body, and the golden glow that had been clinging to her was absorbed into her.

“Amelia…that is a lovely name, Yuru-sama.”

“Umm, what…”

Ah… have I seriously messed up?
