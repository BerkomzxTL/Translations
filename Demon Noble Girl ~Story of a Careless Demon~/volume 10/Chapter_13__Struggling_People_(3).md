# Chapter 13: Struggling People (3)

“So? Geas, what are you going to do now?”

“I’m going to investigate the cause of the hero’s manipulation. Onza-dono, please find out if the people of the Sylber Kingdom are up to something else.”

“What do you mean by something…?”

“Hohoho. The young lady is also expecting a lot from Onza-dono.”

Geas and Onza left the place on Yurushia’s order, but they knew that the place was dangerous for those two who were a little above the level of a \[high-ranking demon\] and that she was concerned for their safety.

However, Geas, on the other hand, was more optimistic, and Onza scratches his head in frustration at not being able to help Yurushia as much as he should have.

“Well, I used to do that kind of work when I was a human. I’ll try not to be a fool.”

“Hohoho, I’m counting on you.”

Seeing Onza’s demeanor, Geas gently looked at Onza, thinking that such an un-demon-like aspect of Onza was also a source of comfort for the girl who was their master.

Geas had a strong connection with Yurushia among her followers due to their previous lives, but his soul is black and muddy because he used too many souls for his own desires.

Even such a soul had depth, Yurushia said, but from Geas’s point of view, he even admired the way of life that Noah and his followers lived, dyed black to the point of purity, and not hesitating to destroy themselves or the world for their Master.

“Well, shall we go?”

“Oh.”

Geas muttered shortly and moved to his destination, trying to be useful to his master by working behind the scenes. Onza also watched and wondered what he could do, but he could not come up with an answer that satisfied himself.

Onza was alone as he looked around the academy.

Onza was dressed in the knight’s uniform of the Duke of Versenia, but since there were many adults such as squires and researchers of the nobility at the Magic Academy, his appearance was not so strange.

“Onza-san, want to go drinking today?”

“No, I don’t drink at work.”

It was probably because of his good-naturedness that he was still approached from the back of the campus cafeteria and other places along the street he passed. Even though he was not popular with the women, he was well-liked by small children and the elderly.

Onza was not simply walking around randomly; the people from the Sylber Kingdom stood out in their own way, and the nobles of the Holy Kingdom who cooperated with them were also on his radar.

“Children, huh…”

If the opponent was an adult, Onza would show no mercy. Even when he was a Human, he believed that going into battle was one’s own responsibility and that one should be prepared to fall on the other’s blade as long as it was pointed at him.

But what about children? Some children may move without thinking because their parents or their home said so, not because of their own will.

Perhaps it was because he was reincarnated as Laplace, a former human who could read others’ feelings and thus anticipate theirs, that Onza had never dealt with someone as vulnerable as a child before.

Yurushia, the master of Onza, did not blame him. Onza was allowed to do most things with Yurushia’s permission, and the other demons did not demand anything from Onza because Yurushia said so.

It may be an easy way to live, but what about as a follower of a Demon God who controlled nearly 10,000 demons?

Shouldn’t he be doing more for the Master as a demon?

“…tsk.”

Unable to think straight, Onza found a noble student with the Sylber Kingdom member near the deserted research building.

“Hey, what are you doing there?”

Nia and Tina would have immediately destroyed them if they were potentially harmful to Yurushia, but Onza called out to them.

And he didn’t even need time to think about it to realize it was a mistake.

\[All for Ester-sama!\]

Completely mesmerized, the Sylber Kingdom humans tossed the magic circle, dug into the metal plate they were holding in their hands.

Booom!!!

“Whoa!?”

Onza hurriedly avoids the flames that shoot up from the metal plate, as if they were planning to commit an act of terrorism. If it was just a magic flame, it would not do much damage to Onza, who was a high-ranking demon, but his opponent was that the Sylber Kingdom. If the power of an intermediate level spirit or higher was used, the demon would also be damaged.

Additionally, if soundless bombs were planted here and there in the academy, the human side of Yurushia’s environment would be destroyed.

“You guys, for goodness’ sake!”

Onza used his power of anticipation to accurately avoid the enemy’s attacks, while beating up and neutralizing the Sylber Kingdom’s people. Some of them had their limbs bent into strange shapes, but it was better if they were still alive.

“…ah, ahhhh…”

Only one student was slumped.

“Hey, you, tell me what they were doing.”

“I am a member of Viscount Hindel’s family, you squires are being rude!”

Onza heard the name and remembered that it was one of the noble families connected to the Sylber Kingdom.

“Huh? What are you talking about? Do you think you have no responsibility for this kind of behavior in the academy?”

“Ugh, shut up! You are the one who thinks it’s okay to do this. I will make peace with the Sylber Kingdom and bring peace to the world.”

“Hey, hey?”

Suddenly, the boy started to roar like a broken gramophone, and his complaining expression froze as his head snapped to the side, and he screams in a strange, upside-down manner.

“Heiiiyyyaaaaaaahh ∬∂āěゞ〃∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞゝé∞∬āヾゞ〃〃♭éāě∮¬⊥⌅āě∞∬∂!!!”

“…geez!”

The student’s body swelled up in front of Onza, who jumped down in a panic, and turned into a frog-like figure, with his entire body covered with thickly growing scales.

“…Chimera, huh?”

Onza had no way of knowing that this was the moment Ester \[ordered\] in front of Yurushia, but even if he had known, it would not change the threat before him.

A human-mediated Chimera of demons and spirits; unlike the first time, it lacked the special black armor and did not have the heinous magical and physical resistance, but it was still a burden for Onza, a senior demon.

“…Kuh.”

That strange voice seemed to be a mental attack, and his vision wavered every time he heard it.

If that was all, the Chimera had retained its human form only in its face. Seeing his face contorted as if he was asking for help, Onza couldn’t help but frown.

Onza felt anger toward the human who had created such a monster, but at the same time, he also felt pity for its existence.

\[ゝé∞∬āヾゞ〃〃♭éāě∮¬⊥⌅āě∞∬∂āěゞ〃∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞ!!\]

“Damn!”

Onza also had no choice but to fight back.

Anticipating the battle against Chimeras, the demons around Yurushia were provided with special armaments in case something went wrong.

Onza selected a pair of knuckles made of true iron. He chose to use knuckles made of true iron, partly because he was not excellent with conventional weapons, but also because he did not want to intimidate the other followers with a weapon, even if they were enemies.

But even if he had a decent weapon, it would be difficult for the high-rank demon Onza to defeat an enemy that even the bravest of heroes would have a hard time with.

“Guh!”

\[éāě∮¬⊥⌅āě∞!\]

He slammed his knuckles into the torso of the chimera, but at the same time, the scales in that area shot out, injuring Onza.

“This guy’s strength is outrageous!”

The enemy who fought Onza’s Master would have had the same impression.

Unlike Yurushia, who had acquired an impossible power by chance, luck, and sheer mental strength, Onza was, for better or worse, ordinary.

But ordinary fighters had ordinary ways of fighting. Onza used his foresight to avoid the flying scales,

“Here it is!”

He would strike the weak spot with a knuckle to the head from behind, the correct way to attack. But…

“Nah!”

At that moment, whether intended or not, the face of the human part changed its position and turned a sad-looking face toward Onza.

\[āě∮¬⊥⌅āě∞∬∂āゝé∞∬āヾゞ∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞ〃〃♭éěゞ〃!!\]

“Guhoh!”

At that moment, Onza’s body was hit from all sides by what looked like a shock wave, and he was blown away.

Looking over, the person from the Sylber Kingdom, who had been knocked down by Onza, got up and attacked him. But that is not accurate in a sense.

They were connected to a tentacle-like thing that extended from Chimera on their backs, and they changed from human form to that of Chimera, a smaller frog, before I could see them.

“I screwed up…”

Onza blurted out as he looked at the approaching group of Chimera, who had collapsed from the impact and were unable to move.

Is this the end? Perhaps it is because he has become a demon, or perhaps it is because of his previous life, but he has no fear of death.

However, he honestly felt frustrated that he could not protect the girl he had sworn to protect, and that he would die as a demon without being of any use to her.

If he had really lived like a demon, would he not have been exposed to such an abomination? If I had lived my life like a devil, would I have been able to avenge her death?

“I’m sorry, Young Lady.”

He wanted to see that free Golden Girl for the last time.

Yes, that’s right. She was, above all, liberated. Perhaps it was demon-like to say so, but something about her seemed fundamentally different from his own.

At that moment, the girl’s words, which he had not been listening to, suddenly came to Onza’s mind.

\[To be a Demon is, you know, to be the most free of all.\]

“I see…”

He had mistaken the meaning of the word. This was the first time he knew what the word meant.

He thought it was to be capable of any atrocious thing, like how Demons have been portrayed. But no. She was different. In the truest sense of the word, she was free. There was no right or wrong in front of her.

“…There is no more need to pretend, no more need to suppress.”

\[ゝé∞∬āヾゞ〃〃♭éāě∮¬⊥⌅āě∞∬∂āěゞ〃∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞ!!\]

The shockwave caused by the Chimera swept away the place where Onza had been.

The cobblestones and earth were gouged by the simultaneous attack of the Chimera, which was different from the previous one, and craters were formed.

\[ゝāě∮āě〃\]

Just as the Chimera and its splits were about to head for Ester, they let out a single cry…

Hyun!!!

\[é〃♭〃♭éā¬⊥⌅ゞ!\]

Suddenly, in the midst of their attack, one of the splits exploded.

\[ゝé∞∬āヾ∬∂āěゞ〃∞∬ーゞ!?\]

In the next instant, this time, one of the splits on the opposite side of the group shattered.

\[āě∮¬⊥⌅āě∞∬∂āゝé∞∬āヾゞ∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞ〃〃♭éěゞ〃!!!!\]

Understanding that it was under attack, the Chimera shot shockwaves and sharp scales in all directions.

Trees were shattered, the earth was gouged, and the outer walls of buildings were broken. After a few seconds of simultaneous bombardment, a single shockwave was released towards the only place where there was little damage from the destruction, but the shockwave shifted as if deflected by something and was swept up to the clouds in the sky.

A small shadow stood on from that place.

There was a small rabbit, only about 50 centimeters long, facing Chimera and its splits with its arms crossed, as if it were proud of itself.

But it was different from before. A huge amount of “Pressure” that cloaked its body. A golden crown spinning on its head.

Here, \[Arc Demon\] Laplace, freed from the framework of common sense, finally appeared in the human world.
