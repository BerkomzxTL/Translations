# Chapter 3: I Became a Villainess (1)

That last dance was orchestrated by my mother.

It was nice, and I got a feeling that Rinne is getting used to the human world.

On the other hand, it seems like Onzada, who is a former human, is the one that wasn’t used to it. In his case, he is not used to the aristocratic society because of his clumsy way of life.

Nearly two months have passed since my uncle became His Majesty the King, and it’s almost time to start a new school year. ……It’s been more than two years since I’ve been to the Academy of Magic, but this year I should be in the seventh grade. Seventh grade is not a word I’m used to saying.

A lot has changed in the past two months in the Saint Country. The biggest change was the change of the throne, but the south was also making a lot of commotion.

After all, the Duke of Bellrose and some of his noble families and their attendants have fled with their families and soldiers, creating a lawless area with no lords.

The lack of knights and soldiers makes it easier for rogues to gather. The people who have run away had hired and surrounded themselves with a lot of mercenary soldiers without thinking twice, and now they suddenly fled, the mercenary soldiers ended up losing their job out of the blue, so now it’s a disaster. That bea… I think that Mr. Bear and his companion are protecting the front castle gate just in case, anyway that’s being the case those people are worse than hooligans because they’re money-grabbers without any morals.

For that reason, the former Duke family is sending some personnel from the royal capital to manage it. The other Duke family also sent knights and soldiers to help out. But we need to appoint a new lord to govern the south soon, and we also need to find the new head for the other nobles’ position, what should we do?

I think for the middle nobles’ position like the Viscounts and Barons, we could just appoint a new lord with land as a bonus for those who had contributed, but the Marquesses and Counts position were also vacated one by one.

Well, as expected of the Marquis family, they have relatives all over the kingdom, so the next head was decided in no time at all, but none of the nobles came forward to say they wanted the county estate, which has a large territory but it had a deep forest where demons come out.

Perhaps it was a losing business because of the monsters…… And maybe that’s the reason why they easily betrayed the country, moreover right now the soldiers who had just barely held that demon in check were also half gone, so that county’s territory was in a bad state of affairs for the people.

And that’s how Noel, the hero of the Saint Country got chosen.

Noel was awarded the title of count for his achievements two years ago, but he and his adoptive father Mr. Bear, who is a viscount, were both noblemen with no lands and only have title, so he was given the land there for his contribution for suppressing the rebellion.

……Did we force the responsibility to him? To say it in a bad way, yes we did, but to put it in a nicer way, we are only appointing the right person to the right place.

Father also sent out Noel’s adoptive father, Mr. Bear, saying that he will take care of the adjoining baronial territory as well, so Mr. Bear recruited the mercenaries from the mercenary corps with a good ability that had been swarming in the south, and so the original 200 members of the corps moved straight up to knights and soldiers, creating a mercenary knight corps with the Hero as the leader with considerable military strength.

Mr. Bear has no other children besides Noel, so if Noel has a child in the future, he will receive the count title and if Noel has a second son, the second son will also inherit the title from Noel’s adoptive father so the noble girls were staring at Noel with glittering eyes.

“No, it was a big deal!?”

“Well, I can understand that, too….”

Near the southern border, Noel and Rick are having a hard time talking to each other, For a moment, I thought I heard my inner voice retorting.

I know Noel has been busy, but I wonder if Rick is busy doing something too?

The reason why we are all here at the border is to welcome a group of “royalty” from the Sylber Nation who are studying at the Academy of Magic and Wizardry.

The other party is also royalty, and since we can’t let them meet us with just any normal knights, we asked Sir Noel to send out security personnel as well, and we, who are going to be schoolmates, will meet them. ……What a bother.

“Princess, the royalty of the Church Nation is here.”

“Mhm”

Bianca, who has officially become my escort knight, reports to me.

Apparently Bri and the others had a great matchmaking experience, and they decided to officially retire.

……I’m so glad they decided to do this. But it was getting pretty messy.

Since all the former Escort Knight left, we are currently transitioning to a new system with Nia as our new captain and 10 new ladies from the knight families who are around 15 years old, have been hired as knights.

…I wonder if Nia is okay with being the captain.

By the way, the reason why I and Bianca said ‘royal family’ is because the Church Nation has done it again.

Shortly after the Saint Country allowed the second prince of the Church Nation to come to our country to study, they also sneak in his sister, the First Princess, at the last minute.

I was told that they had already moved out and were ready to rent a large house in the royal capital, which had been purchased by a southern baron. …I thought that the viscount was a neutralist, but I was mistaken, it seems.

Moreover, there were about 30 followers as the second prince’s guards and caretakers, but with the arrival of the first princess, the number had swelled to nearly 80, and the Prime Minister had a headache.

It was all right, Prime Minister. Let me bring darkness to your shiny scalp, once again.

“They’re here.”

“Ah.”

Rick, who had somehow arrived next to me, chimed in to my muttered words.

The knights in white and blue armor riding the horses at the front must be the Order of the Knights. There were about 40 of them? Behind them, about ten black-painted carriages with six horses follow.

“That’s quite an exaggeration…”

“There were twice this many when we were on an expedition to defeat the Daemon King, Yurushia.”

That certainly was the case in the past.

Come to think of it, when I went to a neighboring country when I was 8 years old, there were about 60 people escorting me, right? That was because Father was overprotective, that’s why.

“…Nn?”

One of the Order’s knights came to warn us earlier, but when we were within visual distance, a lone knight in bright blue armor was heading towards us.

Noel’s men casually position themselves, and the knight stops his horse in front of them, stares at us as if he’s inspecting us with his gaze, and then whistles lightly when he stops looking at me.

“Whoa, there’s a beautiful girl here, are you the Saint of the Holy Kingdom?”

“…”

He is about the same age as Rick. Black hair and blue eyes. I would say he was reasonably good-looking, but there was something obnoxious about him, something that made him look down on others.

Well… surely you didn’t mean to say…

“Name yourself? I do know that you are a knight of the Sylber Kingdom.”

“Oh? I’m not interested in you. I’m here to talk to the lady.”

The Blue Knight brushed off Rick’s words as he approached us. The Holy Knights put their hands on their swords because of his show of disrespect for the prince of a country, but the Blue Knight paid them no mind and looked at me with a slight frown.

“…You’ve got some kind of blocking ‘skill’.”

“Rushia!”

Noel stepped forward and put his hand on the hilt of his sword, as if he thought he had done something to me.

“What did you do!”

“Oh, so you’re the Hero. But if you pull out that sword, I’m not going to take it easy on you, you know?”

Blue Knight and Noel glared at each other.

Meanwhile, Rick and I, who were late to participate, were surrounded by the escorting knights. I had asked Fannie and Noah to accompany me today, and Noah whispered secretly in my ear.

“He said ‘skill’, correct? Maybe stay behind us until Fannie’s Analysis is done.”

“…yeah”

Blue Knight did indeed say \[Skill\].

If he simply said that about the skills that people have, that’s fine, but if it was really something like the skill of the Otherworlder Tess, that quantified skills or special skills, who knows what he could set us up for.

Besides, he recognized Noel as \[Hero\] at a glance.

Noel was famous in other countries in his own way, but when he saw the young knight-like Noel who came out in front of me, he immediately recognized who he was.

There was no concept of quantified \[skill\] in this world. Even Tess, had to make a contract with spirits to give her the skill from, past reincarnates and great mages.

Then, there was no possibility of someone making a contract with something on an individual basis and being able to use it on their own. In fact, only former Heroes who reincarnated on this planet used the “Hero’s Secret Art” skills themselves.

“…\[Appraisal\] or \[Analysis\]…maybe.”

Fannie next to me whispered, and I nodded in agreement.

But the fact that he couldn’t “see” my status, means that he might not be as powerful as Yuuki. But I suspected that there might be some other “hidden tricks”.

“Brother, what are you doing?”

A girl’s cute voice echoed, breaking the tense atmosphere.

From the group of the Sylber Kingdom, who had somehow made it to our side, a pretty girl in Pink Blonde, about my age, wearing a gorgeous dress, walked toward us, surrounded by the knights.

“Ester, don’t get in the way of me and the Hero.”

“Brother Axel is being selfish again, isn’t he? Oh, is that you, Hero Noel-sama? Oh, cool! Is that Prince Ludric over there? You are much nicer than you look in the story! Oh, Ester is troubled!”

The girl called Ester, with her hands on her pink dyed cheeks, was jumping up and down repeatedly as if she couldn’t contain her excitement.

“””…”””

…….we unintentionally fell silent. Ester…I think that was the name of the first princess of the Sylber Kingdom.

Really…. So, this arrogant Blue Knight was the “second prince” who asked me to marry him.

Also, I could smell a heroine (lol). Would it be wrong if I refuse to let them enter the country?

T/N: Thanks for reading.
