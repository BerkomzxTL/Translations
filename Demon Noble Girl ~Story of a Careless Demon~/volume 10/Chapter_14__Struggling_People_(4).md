# Chapter 14: Struggling People (4)

\[ゝe∞∬?ヾゞ〃〃♭e??∮￢⊥???∞∬∂??ゞ〃∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞ!!\]

The sudden appearance of a small Stuff Toy that scattered enormous amounts of magical power caused the Chimera swarm to cry out in alarm.

The original human soul that had been used as a medium to create the Chimera was consumed, and no proper intelligence remained, but the lower level demons and spirits that had become the material, albeit crazed, screamed at the appearance of the higher level demons.

To the Chimera, the rabbit Stuff Toy sticks out its club-shaped arm and beckoned it as if to challenge it.

\[e??∮￢⊥???∞∬!!\]

A swarm of scaled, giant frogs, tethered by tentacles, attacked the little Stuff Toy, who dodged their attacks and landed like an action star on the rubble a few meters away.

Laplace, the Great Demon. A demon who had the ability to see through time.

In terms of image, it would be easier to understand to say that it was the rabbit that lured the girl to the other world in \[Alice in Wonderland\].

Onza, whose characteristics were set by the Golden Demon, \[Devil\], was unable to fully demonstrate his abilities, as he still had strong human characteristics, and his power was limited to the level of a \[Greater Demon\].

The reason why Yurushia decided that Onza was Laplace was because he was able to understand even the thoughts of earthbound spirits, and used an ability similar to “reading the future” by reading the thoughts of the other party.

Onza changed into a Demon because he had sworn an oath to protect Yurushia, Yuzu, in her previous life, and he had acquired the characteristics of Laplace, further improving his ability to read ahead. Onza was too much of a “human” to live as a demon.

Demon = Evil. This was the common recognition of those who were predestined in all worlds.

In fact, demons were simply faithful to their desires and took great pleasure in devouring all life.

But demons, like spirits, were part of the world. They were also responsible for exterminating creatures that spread like pathogens throughout the world.

For the world, humans who multiply in number were the most damaging to it. That was why demons instinctively target humans, and humans hate demons.

Demons, with their great power, act most unrestrained, but they could be bound by a contract.

This was a restraining function to prevent demons, which were like white blood cells of the world, from devouring all the creatures in it, but only one free demon appeared among them who was not bound by anything.

She was not special. She simply had a free mind unbound by any demonic instincts.

Onza learned the meaning of her existence.

The concept of thinking that a Demon was evil was what had caused Onza to lose the freedom of the Demon within him.

Now that it was freed, Onza became a \[Demon\] in the truest sense of the word.

\[…\]

The Stuff Toy’s short limbs loosely assumed a kung-fu-like stance, and the golden crown, which was not there before, spun around.

\[ゝe∞∬? ヾ∬∂? 〃〃∞〃?\]

A group of Chimera Splits attacked. The knuckles of true iron in his hand punched a hole in Chimera’s torso, lightly brushing aside the attack.

As a newly ascended \[Arc Demon\], Onza’s strength was not yet particularly high.

Even so, Onza’s strength was on par with that of ordinary Arc Demons, but even though this was his first battle, he was able to overpower the Chimera that Nia and Tina, who specialized in physical combat, were unable to defeat due to his Laplace’s ability.

The ability to foresee the future. Even a demon that could distort time and space could not see the future. However, with the newly added crown, Onza was able to foresee the most probable future by calculating tens of thousands of possible futures at high speed based on past and present events.

This enabled Onza to accurately avoid enemy attacks, and to launch the most efficient attacks at the moment when the largest gap was created.

\[? ∮￢⊥? ∞∬∂? e∞Want? ∮∮∮∮∮∮∮∮∮?\]

\[…\]

Repeating high-speed combat with the Demon’s pure magical power, which was ten times greater than before, Taijutsu, which it acquired when it was a human, accurately destroyed the Chimera.

All the tentacles connected to the Chimera were destroyed at every turn, and finally the last remaining one, the first one, turned its face towards the approaching Onza, out of instinct.

Gusha!

\[∬∂? ∂…\]

\[…\]

Onza crushed it without hesitation and gently closed the boy’s eyes, which crumbled like sand, with Stuff Toy’s hand, and for the first time, he uttered a voice-like sound.

\[…Yu…zu…\]

\*\*\*

“I’m troubled.”

Ester, Princess of the Sylber Kingdom, charmed Noel, the Hero of the Holy Kingdom.

They knew that Ester’s ability was \[Charm\], but because the Hero resisted it by himself, he ended up in a state of hypnosis.

There was a high possibility that the brainwashing could be broken by disabling either Ester or the Hero, and in fact, Yurushia tried to do so, but she feared that if she did so, bad rumors would be spread by the nobles who were part of the Sylber Kingdom.

Yurushia herself would not mind the rumors, but as a follower of the King, she could not allow such a thing to happen. More than that, Geas was sincerely concerned about her ruthlessness if she were to let loose, but also her good-naturedness.

Unlike the other four followers, who trust and worship Yurushia’s power from the bottom of their hearts, Geas was more like a human in this sense.

However, Geas was currently troubled not because he was worried about his master, but because he was at a loss to determine the cause of the brainwashing of the Hero, Noel.

Even if Ester’s \[Charm\] was powerful, it was unlikely that she could have easily brainwashed the Noel, who was protected by the Spirit of Light.

Perhaps he was caught in a gap in his mind. I thought the cause of that gap was in the academy and was investigating, but I couldn’t follow the actions of the Hero all the time.

“…It can’t be helped.”

Muttering quietly and moving to an unpopular place, Geas in his old butler form disappeared, and a small teddy bear of about 50 cm appeared following him.

\[Gau\].

Geas hesitates to take on this form, which was his true form because in this form, even his thoughts were simplified.

His essence remains the same, but if he would become careless, he would forget to humanize himself, and he would be drinking with Onza or playing with a ball.

Still, Geas had a reason why he had to be in this state.

\[Gau\].

The Bear Stuff Toy, who was on all fours and circling the area, suddenly looked up.

Half a day from the time he could no longer follow. Geas, who had picked up the slightest scent of the Hero from there, resumed his pursuit on foot.

The Stuff Toy, a moving teddy bear, were known as freestanding magical tools made by Yurushia, and although there were no insolent people trying to capture them, female students writhing at the sight of their moving figures and young children in the lower grades followed them, making it difficult to move around.

The scent of the Hero and the other one continued towards the Academy’s old buildings, and Geas stopped in front of one of them, a half-destroyed, off-limits school building.

“This is it, right here.”

Geas, who had managed to remember to humanize himself, changed into the form of an old butler.

He was moving quietly and soundlessly through it when he saw a figure that seemed to be related to the Sylber Kingdom,

“Hello, there.”

“Oh? What is it, old man?”

“Oh, this is that Saint’s…”

Shoo!

The two men’s heads easily fell off and rolled away.

Geas shook the 6-inch claws on his arms, splattering blood as he went on, as if nothing had happened.

Geas was different from Onza, who was not originally a demon, after all, the four followers, were pure demons.

Geas’s attribute is \[Evil\]. Geas’s soul was tainted with \[sin\], as he used tens of thousands of human souls for his own desire, even though it was only because he was inspired by the Devil.

Sin by a pure wish. Rather than seeking redemption, Geas wished to enter the deeper darkness for his Master who saved him.

I no longer need souls. He would simply erase those who opposed his Master.

Geas, who moved forward while making sure to kill anyone in sight, was not a Demon, but rather a darkness created by human karma.

“This is the place, is it?”

Quietly, he opened the door to a classroom and found what appeared to be two female students with their arms bound.

“Are you Sherlind-sama?”

“…Ah, Geas-san!”

Geas puts his index finger to his mouth and smiles gently at Sherry, who recognized Geas’s figure and raises her voice.

“Please be quiet. I’m here to help you.”

“I understand. What about Noel-sama? He’s been under a strange spell because of me, and…”

“Yes, I am aware of that. I know, and Miss Yurushia is taking care of him now, but do you know any way to neutralize him?”

“I don’t know, however, take me with you. I will stop him.”

“…I see.”

Because of Sherry’s abduction by the Sylber Kingdom, the Hero was forced to undergo a Charm. It was understandable that he felt he had to do something because his friends were in trouble because of him, but he was afraid to put the Master’s friends in danger without a plan.

“Let’s get out of here for now. Can you walk?”

“Yes, and the girl.”

Sherry turned to the other captured female student.

“Who is the young lady over there?”

“I don’t know her, but she was already captured when I was brought here…maybe she knows Noel-sama.”

The woman was gagged as well as her arms, and she was looking at Geas and the others with dazed eyes, as if she had been drugged.

“That person…”

Geas checked her name against the nobility almanac that he had memorized since coming to this world, which lists the ages of all nobles, their hair color, skin tone, and eye color,

“Sherlind-sama, please allow me to bring her down… she is a noble of the Sylber Kingdom faction…”

\[? ∮￢⊥? ∞∂? ∞∂? I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. ∞∂∂?\]

As if it had been planted that way from the beginning, when Geas and Sherlind moved away, the female student’s body bloats and transformed into a salamander-like figure with wings.

“…Chimera.”

The moment she muttered that, Geas slashed the Chimera’s neck with a true iron claw.

\[?∞∬ー々ヽ⊿ゞ〃?∮￢⊥???∞∬∂?ゝe∞∬?ヾゞ〃♭e?ゞ〃!!!!\]

“Kyaaaah!?”

However, the attack only slashes about a third of the Chimera’s neck, and the Chimera screamed, followed by Sherry after receiving a mental attack.

“Sherlind-sama, please run. I’ll hold it off.”

“Oh, yes, I understand.”

Realizing that she would only be a hindrance even if she stayed here, Sherry bowed her head to Geas while holding her wobbly head.

Geas smiled at Sherry with eyes as if he was looking at his granddaughter. But then–

“Kyaaaah!”

“Sherlind-sama!”

Just as Sherry was heading for the door, the Chimera, as if under orders not to let anyone escape, attacked Sherry and slashed deeply into the back of Geas, who protected her.

“Geas-san!”

“This is…troubling.”

Geas, with sweat on her forehead, let out a wry smile.

There was no way to escape while protecting Sherry in this state. Geas let out a sigh, wondering if he still had this kind of human heart left in him.

But even in this situation, there was a way to defeat the Chimera.

Unlike Onza, who was so late to grow up, Geas had once evolved into a \[Demon Beast\] and had only regressed to a \[Superior Demon\] as a reaction to his rapid growth.

Although Geas could temporarily take on the form of a \[Demon Beast\] by receiving his Master’s magic power, he had been searching for a way to increase his power in his own way since he came to this world.

In Geas’s pocket, there was a magic jewel given to him by Rinne, which had once been emptied by turning Rinne into a human, but he had accumulated a certain amount of pure magic power from the battles he had fought so far.

It was pure magic power that he was going to offer his Master, but with it, Geas might be able to evolve into \[Great Demon\]. But at the same time, he might lose the Humanization Skill, which was now in a delicate balance.

And to use it here would mean that Sherry, who was human, would know that he was not human, and he would not be able to take care of his Master in public without being exposed as a Demon.

However–

What would it matter?

Yurushia would be sad if this Sherlind died.

For Yurushia, for Sherlind. For these sweet grandchildren… Geas gave up living in the human world for them.

\[Gau\].

Receiving pure magic power from the Magic Jewel, the dark brown fur changed into a pure white, fluffy, little bear-like teddy bear.

\[ゝe∬? ヾゞ∞ーーー々ヽヽ⊿⊿〃〃,\]

The next moment, the Chimera was slashed by the claws made of assimilated true iron and its neck was bitten off, easily destroying the Chimera.

“…”

\[Gau\]

Geas pointed toward the door as Sherry widened her eyes and stared at him, and just as he started to walk away to hide his appearance, Sherry lifted him up from behind and hugged him as hard as she could.

“Geas-san, you were Bear-san! You are indeed Yuru-sama’s follower!”

“…Geas-san, Bear-san!”

It seemed that Sherry was something more than Geas had thought.
