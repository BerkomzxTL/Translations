# Chapter 17: Invitation to the Sylber Kingdom

“Rose, what have you done to Ester?”

“Brother Axel, it has been a long time. What did I do… I just \[retrieved\] Sister Ester, as instructed by the Queen.”

Condemned by her brother, the second prince, at the entrance of the mansion, the second princess Rose lightly poked her sister, who was lying on the ground, with the pointy toe of her knight’s outfit.

“I could see that you’ve done something! Hey, give me Ester!”

“Feel free to have her. I don’t need her anymore.”

Rose shifted to the side, and Axel’s followers rushed to retrieve Ester. But…

“Axel-sama, Ester-sama is unconscious!”

“…This… it seems like her spirit has been broken…”

Axel glared at Rose when he heard the voice from his follower.

“You…”

“Sister Ester should be handed over to the Holy Kingdom as it is. Even if she never wakes up again, handing over the culprit will save the face of the Sylber Kingdom.”

Axel looked again at his sister in front of him.

Compared to the wild Ester, Rose was quiet and plain, and he did not even remember her face well, but he did not expect her to be so ruthless and capable of easily disabling Ester.

Her face, too, was more well-formed than Ester’s, and the doll-like features that lacked a human touch horrified Axel, making him back away.

It was unlike the golden girl, who was also doll-like, but had the same doll-like appearance, but with a somewhat faded human smell.

“Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some business to attend to.”

“Wait, where are you going, Rose?”

Rose turned her back and gave Axel a dark, horrified look.

“This is my original purpose for coming to this place. If you interfere, I’ll get rid of you too.”

“What…?”

Without further conversation with the exclaiming Axel, Rose trotted her horse to its destination.

“You collected it first? It’s surprisingly troublesome, that \[Golden\]…”

\*\*\*

“Yurushia, Princess Rose of the Sylber Kingdom, has requested to see you.”

“Okay, I understand. I’ll see her.”

Yesterday, after hunting down Ester in various ways and taking only her soul power, I had no choice but to leave her to Axel in the end, and only the crippled Ester was handed over to me that day.

Neither Axel nor anyone at the Sylber Kingdom held their tongue, but it was said that Rose, the second princess of the Sylber Kingdom, who was only 12 years old, was dispatched on short notice from the Sylber Kingdom and took care of Ester.

I was at the castle because I thought she would probably come to the castle to greet him, but she didn’t show up until the next day, which is a lame excuse.

I heard that Rose had an audience with my uncle, the king, and asked to see me straight away,

“Uncle, can you leave the Sylber Kingdom business to me right now?”

“…Don’t be too reckless, okay? We can’t start a war with the neighboring countries, you know?”

“I’ll take care of it.”

My uncle returned to his office and chatted with me, looking a little sick to his stomach. Still, since it was an open secret that the Sylber Kingdom was using Chimera, it was decided that it was best for me to leave so that I could deal with it.

Well, father was against it until the very end.

But now, with the King’s approval, I became the contact person for the Sylber Kingdom. They gave me a lot of grief, but let’s see what they have in their hands.

So, I had a private meeting with Princess Rose at the end of the castle.

“Nice to meet you, Yurushia-sama, my name is Rose.”

“Yes, nice to meet you.”

Rose kneeled down and bowed her head in a graceful gesture, not caring that she was greeted in a bare stone room with no furniture or plaster in the interior.

“You are a demon, aren’t you?”

“Yes, I am honored to have an audience with the newest and highest ranking demon.”

Rose’s skin turned an earthy color, veins appeared all over her face, and the knight’s ceremonial clothes turned into rags that looked like they had been weathered for a thousand years.

“\[An Arc Demon\]…”

I didn’t know if she wanted to collaborate with me or if she was summoned, but this girl seemed to be a pretty high-ranking demon.

“Why is a demon working for the Sylber Kingdom? Don’t you feel anything when you see that Chimera?”

“Nothing? I don’t care about the lower demons and spirits, you know?”

Rose said without hesitation with a giggle.

This… there was something wrong with Rose, a demon, or perhaps it was the fault of the Queen, who made a contract with her.

Demons and spirits were like white and red blood cells if we put the world as an individual. If they mutated maliciously, they would be like cancer cells, and neither demons nor spirits would instinctively accept them.

Maybe I should get rid of it now?

“Oops, wait a minute. I have no intention of antagonizing you.”

Sensing my murderous intent, her tone was light and dismissive, but she spoke quickly and said she wasn’t an enemy.

“After all this time? After all you have done to the Holy Kingdom?”

“That is partly for the convenience of the human side, and partly because the Queen wanted to keep this country in check in order to bring you into the Sylber Kingdom.”

“As a hostage, right?”

“Yes, Yurushia-sama, unlike most demons, loves humans like pets, doesn’t she?”

“So what? And you are saying you don’t want to antagonize me?”

“As a demon, I swear upon the Supreme Demon, the God of the Demon World, if only you would come to my country, I will do nothing more.”

I guess this could also be a demon’s way of thinking. It must be an odd thing for a normal demon to have feelings for a human.

“Nope, it’s too much trouble.”

“Huh?”

Rose’s face, which had been smiling at me, distorted like a piece of clay when I refused in a light tone.

“I don’t understand. Do you really want to live among people so badly? I can’t even eat people as I like because I have to be constantly messing up my perception, or I’ll look suspicious.”

Rose, who had started to mumble and complain, thought about something for a bit, and then looked up with a smile, as if she suddenly had a good idea.

“Right, Yurushia-sama hides her true identity from people, right? If that’s the case, then what would you do if I went berserk here? Would you destroy me by exposing me as a demon? How many tens of thousands of people will die before I am destroyed?”

Rose thought I couldn’t do anything about it because I was hiding my true identity, so she smirked at me in a threatening and agitated way.

If it were true, she would have the upper hand in negotiating with me, but her nature as a demon takes pleasure in playing with the minds of others, and she was trying to agitate me, who was higher ranking than herself.

But you see…

I’m… a demon too, you know?

Dogoooooooong!!!!

“Gyaaaaah!?”

I grabbed Rose by the neck and slammed her down against the stone wall with such force that the stone floor was hollowed out like a mortar.

“Kuha!”

“Oh, you look like you’re in pain. What’s wrong?”

I ask with a laugh as I put so much force into Rose’s neck that it feels like it’s going to break into a thousand pieces.

Well, I also acted on a demon instinct, but to tell the truth, because of my attitude toward life up to now, or rather, because of the many things I’ve done up until now, I think this level of thing could be forgiven with \[as expected of Saint-sama\].

I was saying that myself, and I feel a little sorry. Everyone outside, please keep your barriers up for now.

“Don’t worry, it’s only going to hurt a little bit, but I’m going to make it look like you’re still alive, leaving only your form information. Now, perish.”

“Ow!”

As she dug my crimson claws in, I tried to make only the inside of the body disappear,

Boom!

“Kyah!”

“Kuha!”

Something inside Rose’s hand was repelled by my hand, and Rose, who had escaped from my grasp, was staring at me with a frightened gaze. This is…

“Rose…. Are you mixed up with a spirit?”

Hearing my words, Rose took on a full battle stance. A power different from that of a demon welled up from within her, and her strength started to amplify.

It seems more stable than that of a Chimera…but more than that…it was…bad.

–Dokun.

(Abnormal situation confirmed.) (Global-scale harmful elements exceeding the specified values have been confirmed.)

A \[voice\] echoed inside me like an announcement, and my body moved on its own regardless of my will, crushing half of Rose’s body in an instant.

Rose’s face, which had been stunned by the situation so much, changed to astonishment and then to fright.

My consciousness remained. But when I looked at Rose, the thought of \[destroying\] started to spread in my mind as if it was slowly eroding.

I hurriedly suppressed my emotions, suppressed the spreading of this feeling that was not \[me\], and suppressed this incomprehensible \[force\] with my willpower.

When I tried to suppress the force’s activation, I could not stop the eroding emotion. When this \[thought\] filled my heart, I would become this \[force\] itself.

I desperately called out to the \[power\] inside me.

It was still okay, Rose wasn’t that much of a presence yet. I could handle it. Your power was not yet needed!

Little by little, the \[power\] in my body was weakening at my appealing. But it did not stop. It was in a delicate balance, but I had a feeling that if I destroyed Rose with this \[power\] instead of me, there would be no turning back.

I couldn’t even stop my body from moving if I kept both my emotions and \[power\] in check.

If I continued to swing my raised fist down, I would probably…wipe out the entire Holy Kingdom!

Gah!

“…That’s enough.”

Rinne caught my arm on the way down.

That \[power\] didn’t show its usual power…but Rinne’s arm, which accepted and neutralized my true power, was shattered, and sweat was flowing on his forehead.

“…Rin…ne…?”

“It’s all right now… Can you hold back your strength?”

“…yes.”

Rinne told me once more to stop… the power that was raging was subdued as soon as I saw Rinne’s face.

But why would Rinne be here? The last time he stopped me, it was by coincidence that he came to join me at the request of Mother, Vio, and the others. But this time it was as if he had come only to stop me.

I took Rinne’s hand, which was on the verge of healing, and licked the wound with my tongue, trying to read his true intentions. Rinne looked at me with a slightly difficult expression on his face as I tried to read his true intentions.

“Yurushia, you should go to the Sylber Kingdom. I’m sure you can unleash that power in that country.”

“Eh?”

What did Rinne find out? What’s in the Sylber Kingdom? I have so many questions, but when Rinne won’t tell me, he won’t tell me no matter how many times I asked him.

…Oh, well, if Rinne says so.

That power– that was probably the power of a \[True Demon Lord\].

Unlike the numerous self-proclaimed Demon Lords, this mechanism was the worst destructive mechanism for the world to reset itself.

The moment it fully activates, all demons, spirits, and other things in the world would perish, along with all life, no matter how much of a Hero they were or what strength they possessed.

I have no idea how that came into me, but I certainly have to do something about it…I doubt that the Sylber Kingdom could really do anything about it, but if I destroyed the Sylber Kingdom and extinguish the Chimera technology, this power would not be triggered.

“If Rinne says so, then I’ll go…but then we’ll all have to go together again.”

As I said this while brushing the dust off my dress, Rinne unusually did not make eye contact with me and let out another short voice.

“I’m not going.”
