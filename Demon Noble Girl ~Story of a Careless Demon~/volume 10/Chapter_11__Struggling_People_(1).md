# Chapter 11: Struggling People (1)

“Daaa”

“Buuu”

“Aaa?”

“Uuu”

Amelia, who could not even turn over yet, sat up a little and Cyril tried to contact her, but fell on his face as if he had been overwhelmed by pressure.

I don’t know what it is, but it is soothing to see the babies playing with each other.

Cyril usually pulls my hair when I hold him, but he doesn’t do that when Amelia was around. Or rather, he couldn’t do it.

Cyril was scared because it would make Amelia, who was very attached to me, feel bad.

Cyril was usually spoiled by me. I realized at last that Cyril was not reserved to me or Rinne, or rather, he was spoiled by us by letting Cyril do whatever he wanted.

Cyril was probably an excellent judge of our true nature. He instinctively seems to know that we were on his side, even though he knew that we were terribly strong.

But that was why Cyril was defeated by Amelia…. Stay strong, little brother. Your sister would be supporting you from the shadows. Fufufu.

Well, my healing space aside, was it about time for Ester, as Axel said, to start going out of control?

While I was thinking about that, one of Axel’s subordinates, or rather crony girls, came to report to me.

A tall girl with short blue hair. She was the cheerful girl who, as I recall, tried to make Tina fall, put out her foot, got kicked in the opposite direction, and did a 180-degree turn.

“The First Princess is on the move…”

She was about to adopt a rude tone in the reception room when she was hit by Tina’s killing intent, standing right behind her, and with a blue face, she added something that sounded like an honorific.

Stop it, Tina, you and the first four of my followers, have been beginning to deviate from the category of Great Demons lately. That girl could almost die from killing intent alone, you know?

It was partly because I have numerous demons under my command, but also because I was defeating and trapping heroes in other words, so maybe the rank of demons has been rising.

According to her – Krista – it seems that Ester’s abilities helped her rally the boys at the academy to denounce me.

Well, that much was expected considering Ester’s \[Charm\], but there was a high possibility that she would also use something that was utilized by the Sylber Kingdom’s unique craft.

I was not sure what it could be, since Krista did not talk about it even though Tina intimidated her, but I guess they must be using a very dangerous device if they were so stubborn.

I doubt she would actually use that, regardless of how crazy she might be….

“Yurushia-sama, how about Geas, Onza, and the rest of the senior demon class this time?”

“Well…”

When Krista left after telling us what she wanted to do, Noah, my butler demon, came to check on her.

I had not brought them forward until now because I was not sure what would happen if she used her strange skills on them, even if they were members of Noah’s class, a \[Great Demon\], or if they were higher ranking demons like Geas or Onza-kun’s class.

Of course, my lovely devils were corporate warriors who devoted themselves to our company, body and soul, so if I asked them to do something, they would do their best and say, “Yes, I’d be happy to”.

But you know…

“I think i wa’s time for Geas and Onza-kun to work harder.”

“Yes, of course.”

Noah bowed his head without hesitation as I said so.

Geas, who was standing behind me, bowed his head as well with a calm face, and Onza-kun, who had been recklessly asked to do something, looked at me with a face that said, “Are you serious?”

Let’s take Noah and Fannie with us this time; Noah was an \[incubus\], so charms were no problem for him, and Fannie was a \[Nightmare\], so she could handle the mental stuff.

“Yurushia-sama, what about me?”

“…”

There, Noah’s twin, Nia, a \[Succubus\], a master of Charm, raised her hand.

To be honest, it was good that I set Nia as a \[Succubus\], but I didn’t have any expectations for that type of thing.

It wasn’t that Nia was unattractive as a girl. Nia, who was almost 17 years old by image, calm, beautiful like an aristocratic young lady, but strong, was so popular that she and Fannie, a flabby fruit with a bright smile, split the popularity of the Duke’s knights in two.

Don’t ask about Tina. Tina was only popular among the men with a bit of a masculine streak.

By the way, Noah was the most popular among the female servants. Rinne was the second most popular with the female servants. And surprisingly, Geas, the old butler, comes in third. …Onza-kun was popular with children.

“…Nia. I’ll strengthen \[the Golden Demon Sword Nyanko-ken\] for you later.”

“Wow, really, yay!”

I would like to take her with me, but since I would be taking Noah, Fannie, Geas, and Onza with me, I could not leave Tina alone around Rinne and the rest of the family.

I promised to strengthen her beloved sword as compensation for staying at home. Well, the sword I made properly at that time was no longer suitable for Nia’s ability by now.

In fact, I would like to properly make her a complete set of equipment using \[True Iron\]. I felt that \[Iron\] was the best match for demons rather than mithril or Orichalcum.

As soon as possible, I brought four people with me to the academy.

After all, I did not go to the academy very often…. The reason why nobles go to the academy for 10 years was mostly to find a partner to marry and to make a connection, so in that respect, lower-class nobles and commoners were more serious about attending the academy.

Now, I arrived at the academy in a carriage that seats about 10 people, so I looked for Ester-chan…without even looking for her, I heard a shout from the knight department’s training ground.

\[I appreciate you all for gathering here for me today! I will do my best for you all!\]

\[Oooooooohhh, Ester-sama!\]

“…”

Was this a guerrilla live performance by some underground idol?

The fact that the academy was leaving it alone indicated that they were involved? The royal family’s Rick, who was supposed to keep the place in order at times like this, had recently been busy and had not come to the academy, so Ester-chan was free to do whatever she wanted to do.

“Yurushia-sama, can’t we destroy that thing?”

“…Patience, Fannie.”

Fannie, who was standing next to me, smiled as she said something horrible. No, I was about to wipe it out with my \[Shine Holy Bow\] myself as well, but I held back, so please bear with me.

If Fannie did something like that, everyone here would become a victim…? Would that be the quickest way?

“Yurushia-sama.”

“Uh-Hmm?”

Noah’s voice brought me back to reality. I was about to succumb to temptation.

From the looks of it, the boys Ester was collecting were mostly lower-class aristocrats and commoners. How disturbing for her to take in their seriousness with charm…

\[Everyone, don’t give in to the tyranny of the evil Princess. Your thoughts will change this country. There is nothing to be afraid of. I will be the Queen and bring everyone to the Sylber Kingdom…\]

“What are you doing?”

I was not particularly intimidating, but when I called out to her with just letting my presence flow, the air froze even though my voice wasn’t even that loud.

“Oh, Yurushia-san, you’re still bothering me! Don’t be fooled, I’m with you!”

I guess I was the villainess in Ester’s mind, after all.

When Ester raised his voice, their eyes, which had been momentarily brought back to their senses by my voice, became cloudy again. I could see that Ester was serious. It seemed that I ended up giving her a strong impression over a period of several days.

Normally, I would have interacted with her in \[villainess Mode\], but this time I was different.

I was a duchess, a princess of the Holy Kingdom, a royalty, but I have another “Characteristic”.

(Fannie, Go!)

(Yes!)

“Gentlemen, do you dislike the Holy Kingdom?”

As I quietly ask this, the eyes of the lower-class nobles and commoner boys who had been showing hostility towards me wavered slightly. Simultaneously, Fannie applied an effect on me that should have made me sparkle.

“Why do people fight when the threat of the Demon Lord is gone and there will be peace? Many people were hurt in the civil war. Why should we fight over it?”

\[…\]

The boys looked upset at my words. Fel taught me that the trick was to speak at this time with a slightly stronger ending.

“Oh, because you are tormenting everyone, I am…”

“I’m sure I’m not perfect in some ways. It took me two years to come back after defeating the evil.”

The argument itself was changed to cover Ester’s voice as she started to scream. Min taught me that this was a common technique used by con artists.

…I wondered what those two maids were doing before.

“This country belongs to those who live here and love this country. Please lend me your hands!”

\[…Saint-sama…\]

Sneakily saying nice things and nailing people from other countries to stay out of the way, stimulating the patriotism of the boys.

At my words in \[Saint-sama mode\], supervised by numerous people, the haze disappeared from their eyes and they regained their perfect sanity.

But…for some reason, the faces of everyone staring at me were red. Did they have a fever when their fascination broke?

“Oh, you, why,”

“Ester-sama, incitement in another country is a crime. I will report this to the Sylber Kingdom.”

“What?”

Ester’s eyes widened at my words, as if she had not expected this. Rather, you were a princess of a country… you should have common-sense enough to know that, you know?

“It’s not my fault!”

Ester tried to run away with her usual line, but this time I was not going to let her get away. Axel, who was not here, was waiting in the academy with a full force to secure Ester.

This time, however, Ester’s entourage seemed to be a little different. Heading toward Ester’s entourage, who were waiting in the corner, the people whose eyes had completely lost their color pulled out their swords.

They must have been cornered pretty hard. They seem to have a strong charm on them, whether it was used with medicine or some other special charm, such as a contact-based one.

They caused problems in other countries, so they should be caught. right?

“Come on, do your best for me!”

“…ugh”

Ester grabbed the boy’s arm, and a boy warrior appeared with unsteady steps from behind the entourage.

“…Ru…shia.”

“Noel…”

As if trying to hold something back, Noel put one hand on his head while holding on to his sword with a trembling hand.

I see…you had already taken that kind of step. This price would not be light, Ester-chan….
