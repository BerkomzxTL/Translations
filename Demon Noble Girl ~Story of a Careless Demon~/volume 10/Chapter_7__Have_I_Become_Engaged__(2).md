# Chapter 7: Am I Engaged? (2)

Now that we have received an invitation to dinner from Axel, the second prince of the Sylber Kingdom, it would be a good opportunity to harass Axel.

I will have to respond as soon as possible, but before I do, let’s find out a little bit about what’s going on on the Sylber Kingdom’s side.

“Tina, Fannie, I’m going to class, follow me.”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

If it were true, Geas and Onza-kun would be more used to dealing with such people, but they are only slightly better than the senior demons, and Axel’s \[Ability Steal\] could take away their abilities. Well, if Onza-kun, who is 30 years old, is in the class, he will float around, so I have no choice but to take Fannie and the others with me.

Worst-case scenario, if they are re-trained, or I force them to re-set it with my magic, they will be back to normal, but it is more troublesome if they steal the demon’s ability and reveal their true identity.

Let them work behind the scenes with Nia and Noah; taking care of Rinne, who babysits Cyril, is also an important job.

When I said this, Rinne’s gaze became somewhat distant. You don’t want to babysit Cyril?

The number of employees is increasing, but there are not as many high demon-level executives as there are other demon lords. I wonder if there is something we can do about it.

I’ll think about that later, but when I went to class with two maids in tow, Ester-chan, the first princess of the Sylber Kingdom, was there again today, cheerfully showing her bare legs to all the boys.

Usually, it gets quiet just as I enter the classroom, but today only a few female students away from Ester-chan hurriedly bowed their heads.

Well, this is normal. I was looking for a feeling like an ordinary student like this, but if it’s because of some unexplainable \[skill\], it’s a different story.

“\[Good day, everyone\].”

I’ve recently become able to suppress my presence, if not completely, but from now on, I’ll be “Releasing” it like I used to.

At my “greeting,” everyone stiffened and straightened their backs as before.

Ester-chan was staring at me, perhaps feeling intimidated or angry at being interrupted.

According to Fannie’s analysis, Ester’s skill is \[Charm\]-type.

To tell the truth, this is a surprisingly rare ability. Tree creatures and insectivorous plants can charm people by giving off an illusory scent, and vampires use charm magic, but this is the first time I’ve seen \[charm\] as a pure ability.

But according to Mylene, a great vampire who actually uses charm, people around me have a tolerance to charm because their mental constitution is trained a lot just by having a lot of contact with me.

Am I being disrespected?

I’m not quite convinced either, but because I’m being as if I used to be, my classmates remembered \[awe\] towards me and bowed their heads to me at once, ignoring Ester as if \[charm\] had been canceled.

Fannie said that the people in this class were much better from the beginning. I knew that their mental tolerance had gone up….

“Yurushia-san, you’re scaring everyone again!”

“Oh, yes. So?”

I can’t even make excuses.

“It’s okay, everyone! I’ll protect you even if she does something terrible!”

Ester-chan called out to her, but everyone who has been freed from her fascination knows which one of us is more frightening (cries).

“What’s wrong, everyone? I’m here with you, you know? If you are scared, you can come to my country. Because I will be the next queen!”

“Heh…”

Is that what’s going on in Ester-chan’s head?

“Ester-sama…? Who told you that?”

The Sylber Kingdom has a queen system, but as I recall, the next queen is supposed to be selected from among all the people and appointed by the queen herself, someone who is worthy of being called the goddess of the Sylber Kingdom.

“That’s what Mother said! If I can use my power properly, I can be the next Queen!”

“Power…”

I see. If she has the power to charm the whole nation, she can manipulate other countries at will without relying on military force, just by going on diplomatic missions. Since charm power is rare, there may not be many royal families that have perfect measures in place.

The Queen of the Sylber Kingdom is quite a nasty person, isn’t she?

A relationship formed through attraction is over when that person is gone, and after that, it’s likely to become nothing but enemies.

That’s why she encouraged this girl she adopted. I can cut her off at any time.

“That ‘power’ doesn’t seem to be working for me, though, does it?”

“What?”

I smile quietly and quietly, and Ester’s eyes widen, and tears begin to fall from her eyes.

“You’re so cruel, what fun it is to torment me! I’ll never, ever forgive you!!”

With that shout, Ester-chan covers her face with her hands and runs out of the classroom, followed by her guards who are waiting in the hallway. What a déjà vu.

If you ask me whether it’s fun or not, it’s probably devilishly fun.

“Well, just in time, the teacher is here, so let’s start class.”

＊

Also, as usual, Ester-chan did not return.

I said many things about how the Queen of the Sylber Kingdom had agitated her, and apparently I had agitated her in a big way, too.

I was a little concerned too, so I went to class the next day and Ester was not there.

According to the vampire intelligence network, she’s not outside the academy, so it seems certain that she’s inside the academy, but what is she doing there?

“Yurushia-sama, that thing is here today.”

“Is that… that thing?

We are having tea in the salon, and Fannie’s abrupt and as usual sketchy report makes sense to me in the usual way.

Axel had invited me to dinner, but I had sent Tina, the most haughty and irreverent maid in the world, off to give her an appropriate… reply.

“So, Tina. What did you tell them?”

I asked, and Tina, who was standing right behind me, confidently reported with her modest chest out.

“It seems like a country bumpkin who doesn’t know his place to invite our noble Lord, a bastard who can’t even ask her out himself.”

“…Yes.”

I thought that might irritate the other side a little, but it seems that Tina has stirred things up big time. Who does she look like at all?

“That thing’s getting closer, huh?”

“Oh, my.”

“That thing”, Axel, was approaching me.

Maybe he’s paying his respects because he looks like a thug? He seems to have a lot of pride. If he is treated like a hick by someone who looks down on him, I’m certain that Axel would be furious.

“My Lady, he’s here.”

“Yes.”

As usual, Axel was walking in, with only those four girls in tow, but they turned their angry faces to Tina, as if they were about to attack her at any moment–

“Tina, be honest with me.”

“Do you really think that they are equal to you as a servant?”

–They were aiming their bare murderous intent at me, but the expression on the face of Axel, their master, was hard to read.

As I sat on a chair on the terrace, smiling quietly, a few meters in front of me, at a distance that a swordsman normally would not be able to cut through with a single blow, Axel and the others stopped in their tracks.

“I’m here to ask you out in person. Then you’ll accept, right?”

“…”

This was a bit of a surprise. I doubted that the proud Axel, after hearing Tina’s outburst, would come to ask me out himself… a masochist?

“How about it?”

“…Well, I don’t have a choice, do I? I’ll take you up your offer.”

“What’s with that attitude? Axel-sama even went out of his way to,”

“Shut up, be quiet!”

The girls behind him started to complain about my attitude, but Axel silenced them with a single command.

Then, only Axel stepped toward me, and at that moment, the girls’ faces turned blue as a blast of killing intent was released from Fannie and Tina.

“Ha, are all your attendants monsters? There are no such attendants in the Sylber Kingdom.”

Axel smirked at Tina and the others, even though they were ready to kill him.

Well, my attendants don’t always act like this, you know?

Maybe Axel also detected the intimidation of the attendants as a warning only. He might probably be thinking that he can deal with them.

“Yurushia, do you know why I came from the Sylber Kingdom?”

“Yes.”

The reason he came from the Sylber Kingdom was not primarily to study abroad. It was–

“Yurushia, it’s not because someone told me to. I’m bringing you back to the Sylber Kingdom as my fiancée, of my own volition.”
