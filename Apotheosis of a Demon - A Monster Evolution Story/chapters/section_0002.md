# The Summoned Girl: Part 2

*Only third person is used.*  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The heroes summoned to save a world threatened by the menace of
monsters, after the betrayal of one of their own, finally cornered the
one who had become the *Demon Lord of Beasts*, Kanako, deep within the
sacred mountain where monsters were said to originate.  
The feelings of the summoned classmates were, as Kanako's defection as a
Demon Lord showed, far from unified.  
There were those who simply sought to defeat monsters as tasked by the
Goddess and return to Earth.  
Those who, intoxicated by the power gained from their blessings, found
pleasure in tormenting others.  
Those who, having gained praise, lost their attachment to Earth and
schemed to remain in this world doing nothing. However, what set them
apart from Kanako, who had parted ways with them, was their willingness
to kill creatures of this world to fulfill their desires.  
  
"Kanako, let's end this. This battle will end with humanity's
victory."  
  
Yuuki, wielding the blessings of a hero, pointed his sword at Kanako,
having slain the monsters protecting her—unicorns, fairies, beings that
hardly looked like monsters at all.  
Yuuki, along with Minami, blessed as a Saint, knew this was merely an
interspecies war. Justice changed with circumstance. Just as humans had
to kill livestock to survive, they understood from Earth's history that
even those who had once been the rulers of this world could be hunted as
evil if their position changed.  
Kanako, perhaps with an immaturity that mirrored her appearance among
the classmates, had been unable to avert her eyes from this.  
That was why Yuuki and Minami affirmed King Horlos' words that Kanako
was a *traitor to humanity*, an "evil," and chose to sacrifice Kanako
alone as a "sacrifice" to achieve their desires.  
  
"This is the end!"  
Minami hurled a spear of light created with the Saint's power. They
thought that it would be an act of mercy to kill her with their own
hands, as classmates, rather than have her fall to a blade of this
world.  
The spear of light tore through the fairies protecting her and pierced
Kanako's chest.  
The mana that Kanako had been cloaked in scattered like sparks into the
sky, and as her lips, with a face on the verge of tears, whispered
something, the scattered mana transformed into pure white snow, becoming
a blizzard that blew the heroes away.  
*‘!?’*  
They were blown away but suffered less damage than expected. What had
happened? Yuuki and the others shivered involuntarily at the sudden drop
in temperature and a chill that seemed to gnaw at their bones.  
  
The snow that had been swirling around the fallen Kanako gathered, and
from within emerged a single girl.  
White hair with a translucent quality like snow, and white skin.  
A bright red minidress the color of blood enveloped her.  
A figure and lovely face that seemed inappropriate for a battlefield
where lives were being taken.  
The white girl, resembling a snow fairy, shook her softly drooping
rabbit ears, stroked Kanako's cheek as she looked down with jewel-like
red eyes, and Kanako's lips uttered a voice in the silence.  
  
"...Demon King...Snow White Rabbit..."  
  
"...Demon King...?"  
Minami murmured the words with an astonished face.  
Snow White Rabbit was understandable. Now that she said it, it seemed to
perfectly embody the white rabbit girl.  
But what was the joke about a *Demon King*? Had Kanako, who was called
the Demon Lord of Beasts, summoned another Demon Lord from somewhere?  
The girl called Snow White Rabbit looked about the same age as them, or
perhaps a little younger. They had never seen beastmen or elves in this
world, but what could such a pet-like girl do?  
  
"...Who the hell are you?"  
Kouya, who always adopted a rough attitude among the classmates,
directed an irritated voice and killing intent towards Snow White
Rabbit.  
They had been blown away by an unknown force, but the heroes, blessed by
the Goddess, had suffered almost no damage. It felt less like they had
been repelled from the spot and more like they had been pushed out by
the blizzard. Many of the heroes, rather than being frightened by the
unknown force, were infuriated that they, with their newfound power, had
been so easily blown away.  
The suddenly appearing Snow White Rabbit, without paying attention to
Kouya's killing intent, gently laid Kanako's body, which was about to
collapse from exhaustion, on the ground of the sacred mountain.  
  
"...Rest now. Your 'wish' has been granted."  
  
Hearing those words, Kanako smiled slightly, and her body vanished,
dissolving into the atmosphere.  
Amid the heroes who were stunned by the sight, Kouya, who had been
ignored, erupted with flames from his entire body and charged forward.  
"Rabbit girl, don't you dare ignore me!!"  
  
The blessings given by the Goddess varied according to individual tastes
and preferences. Kouya, although he acted like a delinquent at his
prestigious school, couldn't even fight with delinquents from other
schools, and only had a desire to be noticed by others, and a *flame of
jealousy* that he needed to maintain himself.  
That was why he did not hesitate to burn others. His mentality was
inferior to even ordinary soldiers in this world, let alone ordinary
people. That was why he envied others and clung to the position of
*hero* where he could gain praise by burning others to death.  
Kouya's flames, empowered by the blessing of the Flame Warrior, had
enough firepower to turn living humans into charcoal in seconds.  
He had been ignored by a girl who seemed weaker than him. The flames
created by that alone blazed brightly, and the moment that fist burned
the white girl, a red-gloved claw grabbed Kouya's face.  
The flames could not burn even a single strand of Snow White Rabbit's
hair, and within the raging flames, Kouya's body was instantly covered
in pure white frost. His frozen body broke from the neck down, leaving
his head with a terrified expression still plastered on it, to be
crushed.  
  
"Kyaaaaaaahhh?!"  
One of the female students screamed as Kouya, a central figure among the
classmates, was killed, and one of the heroes, flustered, leaped
forward.  
"Uooooooohhhhh!!"  
"Kenshi!!"  
Yuuki shouted the name of his close friend who had leaped forward
wielding a sword-like katana.  
Yuuki knew his friend of many years better than anyone else. Kenshi, who
had won many tournaments in the kendo club, had always said that he
wanted to fight a serious battle.  
Kenshi was also a student living in modern times. Even though he said he
wanted to fight seriously, he didn't want to fight a life-or-death
battle. But he had been summoned to this world and, with the blessing of
the Sword Saint, had awakened to the joy of taking lives.  
Still, there were not many opportunities to kill people. Opportunities
to encounter enemies like bandits on expeditions who could be killed on
the spot were rare, and Kenshi, who was constantly searching for someone
to kill, gradually came to desire killing "people who should not be
killed," such as women and children.  
Kenshi was not fighting to return to Earth like Yuuki and Minami, but
simply to kill others.  
Having gained a justification for killing humans with the death of one
of his classmates, Kenshi swung his blade towards the white girl without
hesitation.  
Without assessing the opponent's strength or "true nature"….  
  
Thud…!  
The moment the white girl clenched her fist without even looking at
Kenshi, Kenshi's sword pierced his heart as he collapsed as if he had
suddenly tripped.  
"...Eh? …Ah?"  
Not understanding anything, Kenshi's face was pale and he was uttering a
strange noise as he collapsed, and the girl in white crushed his head
with her sharp heel.  
  
"...Demon King..."  
Yuuki, forgetting that his close friend had died before his eyes, let
out a dry voice.  
Yuuki, among the summoned heroes, had the *Hero* blessing, and his
survival instinct was sending out the strongest danger signals.  
Something was not right. Something was extraordinary. The adorable
appearance before his eyes could not be trusted.  
He wanted to shout *Run!* to his companions. But his dry tongue stuck to
the inside of his mouth, making it impossible to even utter a sound.  
His companions were *Heroes*. Even if they could not sense the
opponent's power like Yuuki, they had the "courage" to turn their
companions' deaths into anger.  
  
"Everyone, don't be afraid! I'll defeat her!"  
Ayaya, the one with the blessing of the Magic King, encouraged her
companions who were becoming hesitant and brandished a legendary
staff.  
"\[Thunderbolt\]!!"  
A giant ball of lightning was created and released, repeatedly
discharging electricity.  
The fastest and most powerful attack of the heroes had felled even
dragons flying in the sky with a single blow and had mowed down
countless magical beasts living in the sacred mountain.  
But――  
*‘Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!?’*  
The screams of Ayaya herself and her classmates who were gathered around
her echoed in that lightning strike.  
There was a probability of about 3% that magic would fail. However, that
could be reduced to almost 0% with equipment and the legendary staff
that Ayaya had, but for some reason… Ayaya's lightning strike failed by
bad luck and spread, hitting herself and those around her directly.  
  
"Ayaya, everyone! \[Area Heal\]!!"  
Seeing that, Minami, who had the blessing of the Saint, used healing
magic on them.  
Her power was comparable to that of those with the blessing of past
Saints, and she had saved the lives of her companions in many battles.  
But, at that moment, everyone who received the healing magic spurted
blood from their entire bodies, and Ayaya's head rolled off her
shoulders with a stunned expression.  
  
Healing magic was not omnipotent, and if excessive healing magic was
given continuously, it could result in the destruction of the body.
Minami's healing magic was perfect. But for some reason, those who had
not been damaged before receiving the healing magic were instantly
killed by Minami's excessive healing magic.  
  
"...Ah..."  
Minami collapsed to her knees as a result. Yuuki, who couldn't move,
wore an expression of despair as he watched.  
Snow White Rabbit hadn't done anything. Just by making a gesture of
crushing something in her hands twice, most of the heroes had died.  
"What...did we do?"  
That murmur leaked from Yuuki's mouth, and Snow White Rabbit turned her
red eyes to him for the first time.  
  
"You made the wrong choice."  
  
"Ah..."  
What had they done wrong? Was it a sin to betray Kanako... their
"companion"? Or...  
"Is it our foolishness in not acknowledging our sin, even though we knew
it, that is the 'sin'..."  
  
"Destroy the Goddess' enemy!!"  
At that time, there were those who raised their voices.  
"Great Goddess, grant *blessings* to the heroes who have been given your
protection!!"  
In addition to Yuuki and the other heroes, priests and soldiers who
worshiped the Goddesses had also come to this land as a pretext to
support them, and were watching Yuuki and the others.  
Several priests chanted prayers all at once, and the soldiers surrounded
them to protect the priests rather than the wounded, still-child
heroes.  
"Give the heroes the power to stand up!"  
  
*‘――!!’*  
The few surviving heroes felt immense power welling up from the depths
of their chests.  
Perhaps this *Goddess' Blessing* was a hidden technique granted to the
blessed heroes. Yuuki and Minami, who had been frightened by the looming
"death," stood up bewildered as the fear rapidly faded.  
The classmates who actually survived were driven by a rising sense of
elation and drew their weapons towards the white girl.  
But――  
"Wh, what is this!? My hand!?"  
The arm of one of the female students who had drawn her weapon and swung
it twisted, and her muscles began to swell like an ogre or troll.  
"M, my legs!?"  
"My face... my hair... nooooooooooo!?"  
The thin bodies of the teenage boys and girls were grotesquely
distorted, and they screamed in pain and terror as they were forcibly
remade.  
  
Perhaps ordinary people did not know, but the priests did.  
If the Goddess' blessing could be used to kill the enemy, that would be
fine. But when the Goddess' enemy could not be defeated in that way, the
priests and the leaders of the human nations had received an oracle from
the Goddess to use the *Blessing Prayer* to cause their lifeforce to run
wild, using the blessing of the summoned heroes as a medium.  
"Heroes! Fulfill your mission without fear. Even if you die, your souls
will be called to the Goddesses!"  
  
*‘Uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!’*  
The transformed heroes (sacrifices) who had gained several times their
power shed tears of blood as they cursed their own misfortune.  
They had a will. But their freedom had been taken away by the Goddesses,
and they attacked the white girl. Yuuki, whose mind was in disarray as
the Goddess' curse and his own will were mixed up, cried out for help.  
Had they been deceived from the beginning? Had they been summoned, asked
to save the people, and all the pleasant words and praise been a lie to
deceive them in order to defeat the Goddess' enemy?  
*‘Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!’*  
Was this the result of making the wrong choice? Yuuki and Minami reached
out, crying and begging for mercy from the Demon Lord from another world
whom Kanako, whom they had abandoned, had summoned.  
The Snow White Rabbit narrowed her eyes as if pitying the sight, and
gently extended both hands to them.  
  
But they didn't know.  
That had never been any divine mercy in this world to begin with―  
  
"--\[Gospel\]--"  
  
Mist and snow fluttered from Snow White Rabbit's entire body, enveloping
everything in the sacred mountain.  
The forests, the hills, the rivers, everything that touched the snow
burst into flames, and the white flames burned everything away. But
green sprouted from the burned forests in an instant, pure water filled
the rivers and lakes, and wounded animals and magical beasts were
resurrected from the burned flames.  
*‘--!?’*  
The priests and soldiers—everyone who worshiped the Goddesses who had
surrounded the sacred mountain—received the *Divine Mercy* that burned
away the sins of their souls, and burned to ashes while enduring eternal
pain, never to be resurrected.  
And Yuuki and the others who had made the wrong choice received *The
Demon’s Despair* and were given a painless death without their sins
being cleansed.  
  
The left hand of a Goddess, which cleanses sins in the eternal pain
called mercy, and the right hand of a Demon, which judges sins
mercilessly and gives instant death.  
A Goddess from another world born from humans. Demon King, Snow White
Rabbit—.  
Shedy, summoned because this "world" itself had begged for salvation,
soared into the swirling dark sky and shook the earth, causing the earth
veins of the sacred mountain to tremble. As the land throughout the
continent split, mountains collapsed, and human nations' buildings
crumbled, her "existence" finally revealed itself.  
  
A pillar of powerful light rose up, splitting the heavens, the earth,
and the seas, and the humans, frightened by the cataclysm, prostrated
themselves on the ground seeking salvation.  
At that sight, Shedy drew her pure white single-edged sword and pointed
it towards the pillar of light.  
  
"--Perish, you Goddesses who infest this world--"  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
*From here on, it will be Shedy's narration.*  
  
*Next time, the finale. The battle with the three pillar goddesses.*
