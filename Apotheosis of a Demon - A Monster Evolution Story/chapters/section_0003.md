# The Summoned Girl: End

That "wish" was granted.  
From the girl who grieved the death of a creature thoughtlessly killed,
and from the "world" itself, which was being parasitized by something
calling itself a god.  
The reason she wasn't deprived of the blessing granted to her by the
goddesses was because the world protected her.  
The reason she, a human, was able to defy a god was because the world
lent her its power.  
Therefore, that wish reached the World Tree, and drew "me" from beyond
the dimensions.  
  
From the earth that received my strike, which interfered with the ley
lines of the sacred mountain where magical energy, the blood of the
world, were concentrated, pillars of light rose from the sea and the
sky, and finally the "goddesses" of this world revealed themselves.  
It is said that when a creature of the material world with a fragile
soul sees a soul with immense power, it cannot recognize everything and
appears as a "pillar" towering into the sky.  
The "words" of the goddesses echoed in the sky, shaking the planet's
atmosphere.  
  
*"—’Destroyer’ from another world—"*  
*"—This planet is a sanctuary that we protect, you should leave
immediately—"*  
*"—If you do not accept the mercy of the goddesses, then learn your
folly firsthand—"*  
  
The humans, frightened by the "monster" that threatened their lives,
knelt and offered prayers to the "voice" and "figure" of the "savior
goddesses" that appeared before the cataclysm that was about to
extinguish their lives.  
When three goddesses appeared from the light that rose in this world,
their "names" floated into my consciousness as I saw their figures.  
  
Astoria, the goddess of love and beauty, with her white skin and
luxuriously golden hair waving gently.  
Thorseria, the war goddess with her glossy black skin and short-cropped
silver hair.  
Melarose, the goddess of fertility with her yellow skin burned like gold
and long green-black hair.  
  
*"—Destroyer from another world. If you insist on harming the world we
protect, then know our power—"*  
  
Doooooon!!  
"Tch!"  
Along with Astoria's voice, several lightning strikes suddenly rained
down on me from the clear sky.  
Each of them was imbued with a very dense amount of mana. I dodged them
with teleportation and soared into the sky, and at that instant,
Thorseria, aiming for that moment, swung her trident mightily.  
  
*"—Perish, Destroyer—!"*  
  
"—Palesnow!"  
Gakiiiiiiin!!  
Thorseria swung her spear as if to blow away the few clouds remaining in
the sky, and the shockwave, scattered widely as it clashed with the
power of my katana—Palesnow, blew away the forest and shattered the top
of the mountain.  
As expected of the war goddess, Thorseria's attack was imbued with
enough power to annihilate even a high-ranking dragon in a single
blow.  
Doon!!  
Closing the distance in an instant as if distorting space, we
simultaneously unleashed kicks, and we were repelled as if blown away,
taking distance as our barriers prevented them from touching, and I
pointed my right hand towards the distant Thorseria.  
"—*Ice Flower*—"  
GooooooOoooooo!!  
The pure white blizzard that I unleashed, that could freeze even the
soul, attacked Thorseria. However, at that moment the earth suddenly
rose, and a spire of rock caught my blizzard.  
  
*"—Your power is useless—"*  
  
Melarose's voice echoed, and as she spread her loose, priest-like
sleeves, mana burst forth, and huge vine-like plants, born from between
the rocks that had become spires, attacked me.  
It's just like the beanstalk in a fairy tale. While dodging the attacks
of the vines, which were larger in diameter than my height, I lightly
clasped my palms together.  
"—\[Absolute Boundary\]—"  
An ultra-low temperature of extreme cold that freezes even atoms was
created, turning all the vines into ice dust.  
Thorseria's spear and Palesnow collided as she jumped into the sparkling
ice mist, blowing my body away several kilometers. Even so, I changed my
trajectory in mid-air and regained my posture, and Astoria was reflected
in my eyes, her hands clasped as if offering a prayer.  
  
*"—’Summon Storm’—"*  
  
A storm was created by Astoria's power, and I was momentarily stopped by
several tornadoes, and countless lightning strikes pierced me.  
  
"—《Consumption》—"  
I stretched out both hands to the sky and devoured the power of the
lightning. Still, the hem of my dress smoked from the power of the
lightning that I couldn't absorb completely, and the three goddesses
surrounded me.  
  
*"—Ignorant destroyer from another world. Fool who disturbs the peace of
this world. Know that as long as we, who protect this world, are here,
you cannot destroy the happiness of the people—"*  
  
"...Do you only protect humans?"  
  
Perhaps because I answered suddenly, or perhaps because they didn't
understand the meaning of the question, the goddesses were silent for a
moment, and then Astoria, who seemed to be the eldest of the three
sisters, opened her mouth.  
  
*"—What nonsense. We are the guardians of this world. We love all living
things—"*  
  
"Then why do you make humans kill mythical beasts?"  
  
*"—We are the gods of humans. Humans were born in our image. It is only
natural that we, the creators, love our children—"*  
*"—The mythical beasts refused our protection. Not only that, but they
even took the power of managing the souls that we should have possessed,
and prevented humans from increasing. They are nothing more than
vermin—"*  
*"—Humans are still young. If we manage the ley lines of the sacred
mountain that the mythical beasts monopolize, humans will develop
further. It is a necessary sacrifice for the development of the
world—"*  
  
"...So, to you, the world is the world of humans?"  
They are the gods of humans. They have tried to protect the fragile
humans even at the expense of harming other creatures. To that end, they
stole that power from the mythical beasts, who, like the World Tree,
were supposed to manage souls, and tried to use it for the prosperity of
humans.  
By prospering humans, these goddesses will increase in power, and they
believe that it is *for the sake of the world*.  
They aren't even conscious of it. Like in some old-fashioned sentimental
story, they honestly think that *even if the world sinks, it's a happy
ending because a part of humanity survived*.  
They don't realize that humanity is just one of the parts that make up
the world.  
That's why they tried to give the power that all living things in this
world should enjoy to humans alone.  
That's why "I" was called.  
  
*"—!?—"*  
At that moment, the heart of Melarose, the goddess of fertility, burst
from the inside.  
Because she was the goddess of fertility, she had wasted the power of
the world unnecessarily. To the point where I could interfere with that
leaking power.  
I understood their power. Perhaps they were originally human.  
There are gods who claim to have *created humans* or that *they are the
creator*, but I don't feel that much power from them.  
Perhaps several hundred or several thousand years since becoming gods.
Melarose faltered with a dumbfounded face at the damage she received for
the first time since becoming a god, but a god won't perish from that
much.  
Doooooooon!!  
In the thousandth of a second it took for the goddesses to regain their
senses, my sharp heel, which had leaped out, shattered Melarose's head
and crushed the "divine core."  
Melarose disappeared into dust. Seeing that, Thorseria, who had finally
grasped the situation, floated an expression of anger and readied her
trident.  
*"—You bastard, how dare you take Melarose—!!"*  
  
The goddesses and I are almost equal in divinity, but they lack the
combat experience to fight a god of equal or greater rank.  
Gakiiiiiiin!!  
*"—What!?"*  
I received the spear with Palesnow, entangled it, and flicked it away.  
In the first place, gods don't fight. That's not their job. Even she,
the war goddess, only presides over war and never gets hurt for anyone's
sake.  
But you know, there are also "Gods of War" among the gods who fight to
maintain the balance of the world on their own.  
*"—!?"*  
The white blade of Palesnow chopped off the head of Thorseria, who was
dumbfounded by the loss of her weapon. I vertically sliced through
Thorseria's head, who was flying in the air with a terrified
expression.  
  
*"—...You are……!!"*  
Astoria was trembling with rage, having her younger sisters destroyed in
an instant.  
*"Why!? Why bare your fangs at this world!?"*  
"...This world?"  
  
Gashiiiiiiiiiiiiin!!  
  
Astoria received the blade of Palesnow that I swung with the trident she
picked up. But Astoria's mana value is around 300,000 and she has no
combat experience.  
They were able to fight on par with me, a God of War, only because they
were cooperating as a trio. But if she were alone, she would be
instantly killed even if she fought Fiorefata, who wasn't serious.  
  
*"I will not forgive you!! Humans, our beloved children! Offer your
prayers to protect this world from the hands of the demon!!"*  
  
Divine power… the mana of light, gushed out from Astoria, and when her
"voice" was delivered to every corner of the world, that power gradually
began to increase.  
She was truly the goddess of the "people" of this world. The correct
form of a goddess that I did not choose in that evolution—capable of
receiving the thoughts, "prayers," of intelligent living beings and
using them as power.  
I could hear the prayers of the people. The prayers of humans,
frightened, saddened, and desperately struggling to protect their
lives.  
I didn't choose that... Because I am not an existence to be prayed to by
someone.  
And *prayer* is both the power and the "poison" of a god.  
  
*"—Destroyer! Perish for the sake of the people of this world!!"*  
  
Astoria's divine power had risen to the same level as mine.  
But... is that really your will?  
The prayers of an unspecified number of people are a mass of desires.
Not only the fundamental desires of living beings to live and leave
offspring, but humans also harbor endless desires.  
The reason they have protected humans is because they were originally
human. But the reason they tried to protect humans even to the point of
destroying the world was because they were tainted by the poison of
*human desire*.  
And so, the gods worshipped by humans go mad as humanity develops―  
That's why―  
  
"Shut up"  
  
My voice, whispered in 《Divine Language》, echoed throughout the world,
and the world reverberated greatly along with the screams of the people
who heard it.  
*"What have you done?!"*  
I didn't do anything. I just conveyed my voice to the humans. But this
"world" lent me a little power. I conveyed the world's anger to the
hearts of the people and shook their prayers to the goddess.  
And...  
"I also have ‘prayers’"  
The thoughts of this world that called me, and that girl, are within
me.  
Bang!!  
*"—Why..."*  
I put my thoughts into my hand and pierced Astoria's heart in an
instant.  
Astoria, having the *small wish* of the disposable girl struck into her,
muttered blankly as if seeing something unbelievable, her body
collapsing.  
The thoughts of that girl, who loved the living things of this world,
dissipated the selfish prayer within her, and completely destroyed
Astoria.  
  
"Because it is the will of this world to destroy you."  
  
I could hear the screams of despair from the humans who were connected
to her.  
Now that the goddesses who were interfering with the balance of power in
this world are gone, the flow of souls in this world will also return to
normal.  
Instead, a winter age will come for the humans who were completely
dependent on the Goddess' blessings.  
But I know... People are foolish and greedy, but they have the strength
to hold a small light in their hearts and walk forward.  
  
So, remember your little courage―  
  
\*\*\*  
  
—Consciousness, which had been drifting in the dark darkness, awakens in
the light.  
  
"Kanako!? You're awake!"  
"...Where am I?"  
When I woke up, it was a hospital room in a general hospital.  
Why am I here...? I should have been summoned to another world with my
classmates, killed by them, and died...  
According to my mother, who hugged me while crying, I had collapsed
three days ago and had been hospitalized in a coma. The cause of the
collapse is unknown, but apparently a certain "incident" had occurred,
so my parents were very worried.  
  
"What happened?"  
"Well... On the day Kanako collapsed, the children in the class next
door all went missing, it seems."  
"...Eh?"  
  
I was supposed to have been enrolled in that class next door.  
It was as if causality had been altered, and it felt like I was seeing a
dream, but then what happened to those classmates...  
The missing people were apparently found right away. But, their hearts
have been lost somewhere, they had lost their memories, and they were
all apparently frightened of "something" on their hospital beds.  
What happened? My questions probably won’t be answered.  
I have no way to verify it, but I’ve decided to think that surely...
that snow-white *Rabbit God* saved me.  
  
Three days later, I was discharged from the hospital without any
abnormalities and was able to attend school.  
But, although the class has changed, my position hasn't, and I’m still
clumsy and withdrawn, and I have no close friends.  
When I went to school after a long absence and opened the classroom
door, several people looked back and then went back to their original
conversations and tasks.  
A life that hasn't changed from before... but... I won't run away
anymore.  
With "a small courage" in my heart.  
  
"G-Good morning!"  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
*How do you like it? It's become a little different.*  
  
*Kanako initially thought about sending the soul to the World Tree, but
decided to have it keep trying its best.*  
  
*Well then, I will return to the complete setting again.*  
  
*I think I will write again when I come up with new ideas, so let's meet
then.*
