## Chapter 329: Solitary Water Moon

In the east of the continent lies Toho, and at the foot of the imperial
capital, the dojo.  
Its disciples number over a thousand, making it the foremost martial
arts dojo in the capital.  
The Solitary Water Moon was a renowned school, known throughout Toho and
famed across the continent.  
  
"If you lack in any of the hundred arts of martial prowess, and wish to
learn the ways of the warrior, then knock on the doors of Solitary Water
Moon."  
Even the sparrows in the streets speak of this, and their grandmaster,
Kazama Fuji-sai, has long since reached the unparalleled heights of
swordsmanship, revered by countless warriors as a sword saint wielding
an incomparable blade.  
  
In the wide dojo, lit by the glow of a magic crystal, the old man simply
sat, radiating a profound and unsettling stillness that made the men
facing him feel as though they'd swallowed lead.  
  
"...No."  
  
Fuji-sai uttered the word heavily, his long white beard trembling
slightly.  
He wore only a kimono, no sword at his side, yet his words carried a
sharpness and oppressive weight, like a blade at the throats of his
listeners.  
  
"I shall keep your foolish talk of defying the Emperor's will to myself.
Instead of wasting time on such nonsense, devote yourselves to
self-cultivation. That is all."  
"But...Master, do you truly deem this acceptable?! To grovel before
those foreign, colorful-haired people, forbidden even to look to the
heavens! They are, after all, outsiders separated by the sea. If we
unite, we can achieve not subjugation, but—"  
"I said no. If you utter another word, Kiyotarou, you will face me. If
you insist on this foolish path, then kill me before you proceed."  
  
Over a hundred years old, though his flesh had thinned, he still stood
six and a half feet tall.  
As Fuji-sai rose, the men before him stiffened under the pressure of his
overwhelming presence.  
  
"Twelve senior disciples, and you lack the resolve to kill a single
unarmed old man? You dare speak such petty, cunning words? It's one of
two things, Kiyotarou. You will not get a second chance to wipe away
that spit. Choose."  
  
He moved swiftly, seizing the man's collar and glaring down at him.
Kiyotarou, barely over forty— still young-looking—his face revealed a
hint of uncertainty under the murderous gaze of his master.  
  
"I...I do not possess a blade to turn against Master."  
  
Hearing this, Fuji-sai let out a deep sigh and roughly released him.  
  
"Then go. I shall forget today's events. And you, speak of it no more.
You cannot even properly wield a staff, yet you dare to defy the
Emperor's will. Your arrogance is appalling. Hone your skills before you
dare look to the heavens. Understood?"  
"……Yes."  
  
The men departed, and in their place came another man, who resembled
Fuji-sai in his younger days, exuding a powerful aura of martial
prowess.  
  
"Why did you allow this, Kotarou?"  
"I felt that Kiyotarou would heed my father's words more than mine...Of
course, if he persists, I shall bear my responsibility as his father."  
  
Kotarou leaned against the wall, arms crossed.  
He looked up at the ceiling.  
  
"Nearly thirty years have passed...Most of them are unaware of what
happened then. Let us forgive this as youthful folly."  
"That is why I forgave it. But there will be no further transgressions.
If you jeopardize this country, I shall show no mercy, even to my
grandson... We cannot win against that country."  
  
With these words, Fuji-sai gazed at his palm and sighed.  
  
"We desperately reached for the moon in the lone sky...grasped the
reflection on the water’s surface, only to finally understand the
immeasurable height of the moon shining in the heavens."  
  
And he gazed at the moonlight streaming into the dojo.  
  
"...Perhaps this world is too peaceful for me to realize I am but an
iron boat at the bottom of the water." 
<br /><br />

  
The turmoil across the sea echoed here as well.  
  
Sekiburan, the great nation that had conquered from the far west of the
continent to its easternmost reaches, had effortlessly crushed the
allied forces of over a dozen countries.  
News reached Fuji-sai that they had swiftly brought the east of the
continent under their control.  
  
His name then was Kazama Fuji-sai.  
As his name suggested, he was unrivaled in swordsmanship.  
Known as the greatest swordsman in the land, he had completed his long
years of martial arts training and was appointed as the chief
swordsmanship instructor to the Emperor.  
His position initially satisfied Fuji-sai, but the role of swordsmanship
instructor was not what he sought.  
Having lived through countless life-or-death battles with skilled
swordsmen, the days were unbearably dull.  
Then he heard of the events on the continent, his heart stirred by the
prospect of a battle for national survival.  
  
But while many samurai cried out for a decisive battle, the Emperor
alone remained calm.  
He said that a direct confrontation would be reckless—that for the sake
of the people, war should be avoided and friendly relations established.
He displayed a subservient attitude towards Sekiburan, who regarded this
country as a small and insignificant nation. He resolutely avoided war,
silently accepting their condescending demands.  
  
Naturally, many samurai rebelled, seeing this as an abandonment of the
pride of this nation which had long defended its independence against
continental threats. Fuji-sai had little interest in such matters of
state, but his heart leaned towards those who opposed the Emperor's
decision.  
He yearned for another chance to wield his sword on the brink of life
and death.  
It was around this time that he received a proposition.  
  
Three months later, a Sekiburan envoy would arrive along with the
kingdom's supreme commander and hero—Oribul Rinea.  
The plan was to eliminate them here, to demonstrate their military
might, and to change the Emperor's mind. It was a brutal plan, certainly
not commendable.  
However, aside from the Emperor, everyone wanted war with the
continental barbarians, and whoever Fuji-sai answered would act on a
similar idea.  
If the dam was going to break anyway, he might as well do it himself.
Not for the sake of the country, not for the sake of pride, but because
it would be more interesting.  
With that in mind, Fuji-sai agreed.  
  
A celestial viewing match to coincide with the visit of the Sekiburan
envoy.  
Many renowned warriors would compete in swordsmanship, spear, and
naginata before the Emperor.  
Fuji-sai's role was to lure Oribul Rinea to the arena, assassinate them
under the guise of an accident, and then exploit the ensuing chaos to
allow others to eliminate the supreme commander who should be at the
Emperor's side.  
  
Following his victory in the celestial viewing match, Fuji-sai had
proposed to the Emperor that he would very much like to duel Oribul
Rinea, who was known for their swordsmanship. The Emperor agreed, adding
a condition that Sekiburan's consent was required.  
But it was likely that the Emperor also wanted to show the country's
military strength.  
Even while accepting their proposal, the Emperor was not prepared to
submit. He wanted to show Sekiburan that they could not be defeated
easily. Defeating their figurehead, Oribul Rinea, in a match was an
attractive option and he expressed his trust in Fuji-sai's abilities by
patting him on the shoulder.  
It was the first time in a long while that Fuji-sai had seen the Emperor
smile.  
It had been a long time since he had seen this slender young man, whom
he had known since childhood, smile.  
  
In retrospect, it must have been a bitter decision.  
Although he was not blessed with a large physique or exceptional
swordsmanship, the Emperor was unusually intelligent for his age.  
He probably saw more than anyone else, and was alone amidst the samurai
clamoring for war with the continent.  
Uninfluenced by the clamor, only the young Emperor looked calmly at the
current situation.  
He almost changed his mind upon seeing the Emperor’s smile, but Fuji-sai
was foolish. In the end, he decided to go with the flow.  
  
His view was expansive.  
The inner courtyard of the Tenpu Gosho in the center of the capital was
vast, a white sand garden meticulously maintained daily. Fuji-sai
remained calm facing the giant, squinting in the sunlight and listening
to the gentle breeze.  
  
The man wielded a cross-shaped spear, though Fuji-sai couldn't recall
his name.  
  
"I wish to face you with my actual weapon."  
  
He spoke these words, holding not a wooden imitation, but his real
cross-shaped spear. It was certainly a formidable weapon, but still no
match for Fuji-sai.  
In a duel between skilled users of Ki, the length of the weapon does not
necessarily determine the outcome.  
While length might provide an advantage in a duel between those who
don't use Ki, this was because they lack the ability to close the
distance instantly.  
  
It was all a matter of the timing of the approach and the reach of the
blade. If the first attack is missed—or if one is too slow—the length of
the weapon becomes a disadvantage, making it difficult to maneuver.  
And a single strike imbued with Ki is enough to take an opponent's
life.  
  
The spearman, who had won the celestial viewing match before the Emperor
without hesitation, was a skilled warrior.  
He maintained a defensive stance, his spear at the ready, against
Fuji-sai, who had his sword slung over his shoulder.  
His caution stemmed from an immediate understanding of Fuji-sai's
strength.  
  
But that was not a good strategy.  
Therefore, the only way for the spearman to win was to take the
initiative and exploit the length of his weapon.  
The moment he lost the initiative—he lost the duel.  
  
With a graceful movement, Fuji-sai lunged forward.  
  
"!!"  
  
At that instant, the spearman's eyes widened as he unleashed the fastest
thrust.  
But Fuji-sai showed no sign of fluster. It was a thrust that Fuji-sai
had "lured out".  
  
He smoothly slid the sword from his shoulder forward.  
He slightly tilted his body away from the spear aiming for his neck,
deflecting the blade with his own, disrupting its trajectory, moving
further in— exploiting the opening left by the spearman.  
He drove his elbow into his opponent's stomach.  
He twisted the man's left arm, throwing his weight onto him, and forced
him to the ground.  
He placed his sword at the man's neck as effortlessly as breathing.  
  
"The match is over! The victory goes to the Emperor's chief
swordsmanship instructor, Kazama Fuji-sai!"  
  
As the sounds of admiration and applause echoed from the stage, he
sheathed his sword, rose to his feet, and bowed.  
Having decisively won three matches against the strongest warriors,
achieving an unprecedented five consecutive victories in the celestial
viewing match, he still felt no sense of satisfaction.  
Victory had become expected, and he hadn't faced a close call in
years.  
  
The applause echoed, and a voice caused him to raise his face. From the
platform, a level higher than the white sand arena, was the Emperor's
seat, hidden behind a curtain. To his right sat about ten dignitaries,
including samurai. To his left sat four foreigners. Aside from a large
and imposing figure, they were all women.  
Fuji-sai couldn't determine which one was Oribul Rinea.  
All of them emanated a martial aura, giving the impression that they
were not to be underestimated.  
  
The woman with black hair had a particularly strong aura. But her
appearance suggested that she was probably a bodyguard. That left the
blonde woman and the silver-haired girl. The blonde was dressed in an
elegant-looking military uniform, while the silver-haired one wore a
fluttering garment under her coat.  
  
The foreigners had demanded to carry swords, citing religious reasons.  
This was clearly due to suspicion, yet their choice of attire seemed
unsuitable for combat, raising questions.  
  
He discreetly glanced at them. The silver-haired girl’s eyes were
narrowed, with a serious—no, something was different.  
Her mouth was moving slightly.  
The blonde woman quietly reached for the girl’s thigh. The silver-haired
girl flinched, widening her eyes.  
She pressed the blonde's hand and looked at her neighbor. The blonde
whispered something, and the girl nodded frantically.  
  
He considered it as a signal, but dismissed it as a silly idea—the image
of a sleepy younger sister being scolded by an onee-san came to mind.  
Either way, the blonde seemed to be in the superior position.  
If so, the silver-haired girl might be Oribul Rinea, but she looked too
young. Of course, seeing foreigners was unusual. Those born in the east,
such as Fuji-sai, might have significantly different appearances and
ages from the foreigners.  
She appeared to be a beautiful girl, and even if she had stopped growing
unusually early, she didn't look over forty.  
Still, he felt a strong sense of unease.  
  
Her appearance didn't warrant any suspicion.  
Her aura was clearly not that of a warrior.  
Yet Fuji-sai *did* sense a martial aura emanating from her.  
It was a sense that transcended the five senses, a warning bell ringing
in his mind.  
  
He saw the Emperor communicating with an attendant behind the curtain.  
The attendant went to the foreigners.  
This was probably regarding a duel with Fuji-sai.  
  
Through an interpreter, three people were pointed out to Fuji-sai,
namely the blonde woman. The woman seemed to hesitate for a moment
before nodding, and then turned to the silver-haired girl.  
She whispered something in the girl's ear and the girl nodded, standing
up.  
She asked an attendant for her boots, and put them on.  
  
The girl's boots were sturdy, thick leather boots with steel
reinforcements at the toe and heel.  
It was clear that they were more than just footwear.  
  
"Fuji-sai-dono, one more match."  
"Yes, as you wish."  
  
He rose to his feet and went to his position awaiting her.  
The girl, wearing her boots, walked towards him.  
  
"Krische is looking forward to the duel."  
  
She spoke in fluent Japanese.  
Fuji-sai was surprised, as he hadn't expected her to speak the
language.  
  
"I... I too am honored to receive this privilege."  
  
"Honored...?"  
"The fame of Oribul Rinea's swordsmanship has reached these shores."  
"Oribul Rinea…"  
"...?"  
  
She tilted her head and then clapped her hands.  
  
"Ah, perhaps the pronunciation is different here?"  
"Please excuse my pronunciation."  
"No, 'Oribul' might be slightly off too…this is Krische's first time
speaking it properly. Shall we duel seriously?"  
"We have blunted swords and wooden swords... Which would you prefer?"  
  
No matter what he chose, if they fought seriously, it would end with a
single blow.  
It wasn't a meaningful question, but he had to ask for the sake of
appearances.  
  
"Oh…um, either is fine. We won't accidentally kill or be killed, so rest
assured. Don't hold back."  
  
Her smiling words were arrogant. She said it after having watched his
earlier matches.  
He no longer underestimated the girl.  
  
"Then, as it is."  
"Should I take the opposite side?"  
"Yes."  
  
As if a child, she quickly moved to the opposite side.  
They bowed to each other.  
As Fuji-sai drew his sword, and she pulled out a curved sword from
behind her,  
  
"...!"  
  
As if a sudden storm had overtaken a sunny day—the air changed, the
pressure shifted. A cold wind grazed his cheek and the sunlight seemed
to dim.  
  
Even the signal to begin faded into a distant voice.  
  
The realization that he hadn't underestimated her struck him at that
moment. That realization was Fuji-sai's fatal mistake.  
  
The girl wielded a small curved sword.  
The blade was barely a foot long; it looked more like a hatchet than a
sword.  
Even if the length of the weapon didn't necessarily determine victory,
it appeared incredibly short.  
  
However, its shape, resembling a woman's waist, was strangely curved.
The aura it exuded made his back tingle. It felt as if the blade was
already at his neck.  
Her purple eyes were cold and inhuman, and his body stiffened.  
It had the chilling aura of a predator, even more so than the giant
serpent he had slain in the past.  
  
Fuji-sai countered the unseen pressure by drawing his sword and adopting
a seigan stance.  
A quiet gasp of surprise came from the onlookers.  
For the past ten years, Fuji-sai had moved beyond the limitations of a
fixed stance, embracing the freedom of formlessness. Like water, he
carved infinitely fluid forms in the ephemeral formlessness, always
gaining an advantage and overwhelming his opponent.  
He had never doubted this was the pinnacle of swordsmanship, and he had
continued to prove it.  
  
But this was formlessness as well. The pressure of the small curved
sword, drooping languidly like a willow branch.  
Fuji-sai felt a dread of relying on this formlessness.  
The moment his heart clouded, the formless became finite.  
Like frozen water that no longer flows, it stagnated and bound him.  
He had to cut through the pressure using his seigan stance, or he would
not be able to stand before this girl. 
<br /><br />

A presence that surpasses oneself, clearly visible at a glance.  
So this is Oribul Rinea.  
The unparalleled Fuji-sai, whose eyes sought and whose hands reached for
the solitary moon in the heavens, was before him. Even surrounded and
trapped in a water mirror, the peak of perfection could never be
grasped.  
  
"….Magnificent. I never imagined such a meeting would occur today."  
"….?"  
"The Heavenly Sword you are called is not a mere illusion of the moon
reflected in a water mirror."  
  
The words that escaped his lips were praise. Oribul Rinea had surpassed
the realm of the moon in the water—standing in a place that made
Fuji-sai feel defeat merely from her stance.  
  
He had heard that Oribul Rinea meant "Heavenly Sword". But names are
always exaggerated. While he thought she must be a considerable
swordsman, he had resigned himself to the fact that she was far from the
realm of the Heavenly Sword as Fuji-sai understood it.  
  
The heavens that man can never reach. He had named his style "Water Moon
Style" because he was certain he would never attain it.  
Not just himself, but no one in this world, even reaching the distant
future, would ever reach the solitary moon in the heavens.  
Such resignation Fuji-sai held was overturned simply by facing the girl
before him.  
  
"But with such a small body, there must be limits….It's not about
superiority or inferiority in battle."  
  
In spirit and skill, she was undoubtedly superior to Fuji-sai.  
But her small body and limbs had their limitations.  
Her physique—her innate talent—was one point of contention. The rest was
simply how close he could get to her realm.  
  
His heart, which he thought was perfectly clear, was now agitated.  
A cloudiness marred his skills, which he thought were honed to
perfection. Still, his body, honed through countless years, bore the
weight of his history. Since he was old enough to understand, he had
wielded a sword for countless years. Eating, sleeping, wielding his
sword, he relentlessly pursued the path to perfection, never doubting he
would reach the summit. The tenacity etched into his flesh stirred the
resolve to confront the unimaginable wall that suddenly appeared.  
  
"….I accept!"  
  
Fuji-sai made the first move—a godlike advance that seemed to close the
distance between them, filling the onlookers with awe and disbelief. Not
fast, yet incredibly fast. A smooth, effortless beginning, too fluid for
the mind to grasp.  
  
He took just one step forward. The very action was proof of his
unparalleled skill.  
  
Even those who knew what a Heavenly Sword meant were filled with
astonishment and praise at the existence of Oribul Rinea.  
But the silver-haired girl showed no surprise, barely shifting her
weight back by a hair’s breadth. She evaded a horizontal slash aimed at
her neck, a blow that would have frozen the air, with the ease of
avoiding a thin sheet of paper.  
  
Fuji-sai felt no astonishment, only unstinting admiration.  
This girl was truly one who had mastered the solitary heavenly sword.  
  
A single strike from a distance, using the ample space between them.  
A divine blow, perfectly measured, meant to cleave the throat in a
single instant.  
Oribul Rinea effortlessly evaded it, without the slightest wasted
movement, surpassing the limits of humanity.  
  
The advance and the movement of the sword were devoid of any unnecessary
motion.  
Her eyes, which saw through the attack without the slightest deviation,
held a certainty.  
She understood at a glance that, even if Fuji-sai exerted full control
of his body and wielded the best possible blow, it would fall just short
of its mark.  
  
Having avoided that blow, Oribul Rinea now held the initiative.  
The distance had closed.  
The girl's unconventional weapon—its shortness, which was once a
weakness—was now an advantage, and there was no longer any chance for
Fuji-sai to win.  
Just as Fuji-sai had delivered a divine blow, she too would unleash a
divine flash with the same ease as breathing.  
Having parried the best possible strike, she would then counter with a
second, and with a third strike, she would undoubtedly claim Fuji-sai's
head; of this she was certain.  
  
Embracing resignation and admiration, he threw himself into defending
against this unprecedented and unparalleled duel. An intuition that he
could parry two attacks if he gave his all.  
The third and final defeat, achievable only through a razor-thin path.
If he didn’t make it reality, all his efforts would have been for
naught.  
  
The girl's right arm swayed like a heat haze. A movement that could have
cleaved a thousand necks, but it was incredibly slow.  
There was no strain, no visible movement at all.  
Despite being tangible, it was as light as a summer breeze, and yet in
an instant, it became a raging gale.  
  
A sword that could only be grasped with such deep concentration that
even time itself felt clear. Yet, by the time he noticed, the blade was
already halfway there, on the verge of cleaving his neck.  
Dodging was too slow. Parrying was impossible. So, he attacked—parrying
with a counter-attack.  
  
He angled his sword in his hand and unleashed a lightning-fast strike
from high to low. The girl's response was less speed and more
precognition. The instant he started angling his sword, she drew back
her own, slipping under his downward stroke and striking at his right
flank.  
Without killing her momentum, she took a light, almost unnoticeable step
with her right foot, pivoting to her left and circling behind him.  
  
Her footwork was the very embodiment of ever-changing death.  
Her landing behind him felt like the start of an advance. She seized the
next instant, and that advance would easily cleave Fuji-sai's neck.  
Like a sickle of wind, an invisible blade was perpetually at his
throat.  
  
Even being able to avoid that initial blow was a million-to-one
chance.  
A confrontation of instants imperceptible to almost every human eye.  
Even if one could perceive it, they would offer unreserved praise. If
anyone other than Fuji-sai had done the same, Fuji-sai himself would
have thought so.  
  
But Fuji-sai didn't think that was enough.  
His true worth was to be tested in the next move. Only by parrying that
would his life dedicated to the sword be justified.  
  
In an instant, in a moment that felt like time had stopped, thoughts
bloomed and scattered like sparks—  
  
"—Now, strike down the foreigners!!"  
  
Suddenly, that voice echoed.  
The girl, who was about to strike Fuji-sai, left him behind in the next
moment. In the blink of an eye, she was running through the palace
hall.  
  
Those who shouted were not Fuji-sai’s companions. There must have been
others who also rejected Oribul Rinea's subjugation and aimed to disrupt
the negotiations here. Originally, Fuji-sai was supposed to defeat
Oribul Rinea and then give the order.  
They may have known the plans in advance, or it may have been a
coincidence.  
  
Regardless, his dominant emotion at that moment was anger.  
  
Everything that Fuji-sai had devoted himself to.  
His ultimate duel—his ultimate defeat—had been defiled.  
  
"Kill the rabble-rousers!!"  
  
Anger propelled his roar. He instantly pursued the girl—and because of
this, he could see clearly. At the moment the head of the warrior family
and the Grand General, who had yelled out, drew his sword at his waist
and took a step toward the foreigners, a silver wind passed through him,
opening a red flower in his neck.  
Several men who rose with the man were dumbfounded, and the comrades who
appeared from behind a sliding door were similarly stunned.  
  
The next moment, she leaped into the air, and Oribul Rinea kicked off
the ceiling, striking down another from above.  
Unrestricted flexibility.  
It wasn't a deliberate feint. It was like an acrobatic display, yet it
looked so natural. She kicked off the ceiling as easily as walking,
running, and stepping forward.  
  
While Fuji-sai killed one man, Oribul Rinea killed two more. The beauty
of her form was simply the embodiment of reason.  
Once her blade moved, it followed a single trajectory, an inevitable
flow.  
  
She killed two more, making it three for her.  
It wasn't just killing people. She had a clear plan while killing people
and realized her ideal form for all the movements.  
  
It wasn't just the one-on-one duel a moment ago.  
Their fundamental nature was different, and she was overwhelmingly
superior.  
  
It was probably a sword honed in the chaos of the battlefield.  
  
The remaining three foreigners also killed several people with the
swords at their waists, falling onto the white sand.  
Oribul Rinea also landed on the white sand.  
  
"Silence!! How dare you perpetrate such a shameful act in front of
me…!!"  
"Y-Your Majesty…"  
  
A slender young man emerged from behind a curtain, his anger evident as
he surveyed the scene.  
Fuji-sai positioned himself to protect him.  
  
"Enough, Fuji-sai! If you intend to be further disrespectful to my
guests and mock me, then kill me first. Here and now, show me the
Emperor's sword…!!"  
  
The emperor picked up a fallen sword and glared at those around him. A
voice that could be described as a roar of cloth tearing.  
But was it excitement or fear?  
Seeing his hand tremble slightly, Fuji-sai roared.  
  
"—In the presence of His Majesty!!…The tide has turned, sheathe your
swords!"  
  
He was not a skilled swordsman himself. That was Fuji-sai's role.  
  
With that cry, the men put down their swords, prostrated themselves,
and  
  
"Seize them!!"  
  
Those who had rushed to the scene on hearing the commotion began
restraining the men.  
The Emperor, without paying attention to this, descended to the white
sand and bowed deeply.  
  
Voices of "Your Majesty" echoed, but the Emperor did not respond.  
  
"This is not something that can be forgiven with a bow, but I deeply
apologize for this mishap."  
  
Hearing these words, Oribul Rinea conveyed something to the blonde woman
as if interpreting. The woman replied with some words. Oribul Rinea
turned to them, and spoke.  
  
"Um, please raise your head. Your Majesty's feelings have been conveyed,
but since blood has been spilled, we will leave for today. We'll arrange
another meeting later to discuss this calmly."  
"….Thank you."  
  
When the Emperor raised his face, Oribul Rinea touched her lips with her
fingertip, as if thinking, and tilted her head, looking at Fuji-sai.  
  
"And, we interrupted it, but should we continue the match?"  
  
Fuji-sai was momentarily stunned and met the Emperor's gaze. She acted
as if nothing had happened.  
Indeed, perhaps for her, it was a trivial matter.  
  
"Thank you for your kind words—however, I have realized the shallowness
of my training from that match. If I may have another opportunity
someday, I would gladly welcome it."  
"Ha….Is that so? Ehehe, then perhaps another time."  
  
Looking at her, he suddenly noticed something strange. In that short
time, she had killed six people, and Fuji-sai had also killed three at
his side. Fuji-sai was covered in blood, but not a single drop was on
her fluttering cloak or beautiful silver hair.  
She remained just as she was during the match—in her beautiful form.  
The moment he realized that, he understood her true skill, and his
strength drained away.  
  
What he had seen before wasn’t a water mirror at all. He had only seen
the swaying moon's reflection in the heavens as seen from the bottom of
a pool.  
  
The surface of the water where he desperately surfaced. How beautiful
the brilliance was from his view.  
  
From that day on, Fuji-sai changed his proud name.  
  
He was an iron boat sinking to the bottom of the water—the solitary moon
in the heavens was far, far away.

Fortunately, Oribul Rinea did not demand anything significant as a
reason for the rebellion—an attempted murder of the military
commander-in-chief and the queen's sister.  
The Emperor, who had almost resigned himself to war, was given a chance
to talk, as promised, and if he swore allegiance, it would be treated as
almost ignored—much of the land is covered with mountains and forests,
and it is an island far from the mainland, so it was overly generous.  
  
The Emperor rejoiced, relieved, and patted Fuji-sai on the shoulder. He
said he was glad to have such a loyal retainer by his side.  
  
That's how it would be in the Emperor's mind, who knew nothing.
Fuji-sai, while not winning or losing against Oribul Rinea, acted
swiftly against the warrior's riot and prevented it, which had made a
significant impression.  
He seems to think that the impression he gave to the other side was
great. He doesn't even have a shred of doubt about the fact that
Fuji-sai was also originally one of those planning the riot. He acted
quickly due to his anger at having his duel disrupted. He had no
righteous indignation, political motives, or intention to serve the
Emperor. It was a purely personal and ridiculous reckless act.  
  
But the Emperor trusted Fuji-sai, praising him as an irreplaceable loyal
retainer. Since then, Fuji-sai vowed to live up to the Emperor's trust
and not betray his words as a loyal retainer.  
  
About thirty years later—the relationship between the two countries was
good due to the Emperor's virtuous rule, but such events had become a
thing of the past and were fading from memory.  
Perhaps it was unfortunate that he hadn't been able to defeat Oribul
Rinea. Fuji-sai was a sword saint equal to Oribul Rinea, and if they had
a serious duel, Fuji-sai would win.  
People began to say that Fuji-sai was unparalleled. They said that even
the greatest hero on the continent could not defeat this island nation's
sword saint.  
  
And with Oribul Rinea’s strength, they could surely defeat that
country.  
The number of people who said they should break free from their current
subservience and make the Emperor's authority known was increasing.  
Shamefully, there were fools among Fuji-sai's disciples who were
inclined to this way of thinking.  
  
At that time, the Emperor told him about Oribul Rinea's visit.  
Fuji-sai bowed to the Emperor and wished to have his last battle, a
continuation of that day. He wanted to experience the defeat of the
third move that he missed that day—to carve the unprecedented battle
into his life.  
  
The location was the dojo—in front of his proud but clouded disciples. A
voice announced her arrival, and a girl unchanged from that day
appeared.  
  
"It’s been a while, Fuji-sai. Krische heard you wanted to continue our
duel from way back then."  
  
Ignoring those who looked perplexed at her appearance, Fuji-sai bowed
deeply.  
  
"Yes. I wished to have another match with you."  
  
Hearing that, he stood up, hand on his waist-sword. Seeing this, she
looked at those around her, smiled, and asked.  
  
"Yes. Then, let’s…um, shall we begin immediately?"  
  
There were three moves that time.  
But thirty years had passed—this would be the culmination of his life’s
work, and today he would wield his sword.  
How close had he gotten?  
  
"If you please."  
  
And today, how close would he get?  
The moment he drew his sword, he felt a sense of defeat, just like when
he was a child learning to wield a sword.  
But even when she held her curved sword, his heart was calm, like a
mirror’s surface, reflecting the high moonlight.  
  
Once, he called himself the Water Moon Style. The solitary moon shining
in the heavens—the resignation that it was a phantom beyond human reach,
he had likened his sword to the moon on the water's surface.  
In fact, what he wielded was a water moon.  
But now, that was not what was before him.  
  
In her hands, there was the brilliant principle of the moon, holding a
certain perfection.  
Not an illusion, not a trick, but a heavenly sword that mocked his
foolish resignation.  
The illusory moon he once reflected in the water mirror was now a
bubble—from that day on, he had only captured the outline of the moon.  
  
They both stood, their swords forming an intangible, boundless willow.  
He was proud to be facing her.  
  
"Whenever you’re ready, Fuji-sai."  
"I changed my name that day….It is presumptuous of me before you."  
"….?"  
  
As if collapsing, he lowered his body, and she did the same.  
  
Even a single step was the ultimate principle. The solitary moon in the
heavens remained far away—he looked at it, smiling and narrowing his
eyes.  
  
The sword he would now wield was the culmination of his swordsmanship.
But it wasn't a sword to win.  
  
—It was a sword to reclaim his defeat from that day.

―About thirty years ago.  
  
"I provoked them quite a bit with letters. If we go in with a small
group and show an opening, their soldiers—the warrior class—will
probably cause a rebellion, so please be appropriately cautious. Our
goal is to gain a favor from the seemingly good-natured Emperor, so it
would be helpful if you keep a tight leash on Onee-sama and minimize the
killing."  
"You... you're stirring up trouble again, aren't you?"  
"Don't complain. I'm doing my work over here alone, and it's extremely
difficult and busy. I'm even working right now—Anne-sama, my back hurts,
you're pressing too hard. ...I'm working right now."  
"Don't tell such obvious lies."
