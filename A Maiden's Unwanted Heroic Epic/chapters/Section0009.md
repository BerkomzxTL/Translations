## Chapter 319: Obligation V

Suikos spend most of their time sleeping.  
They awaken from their shallow slumber typical of beasts when they sense
something, but generally, they are only active during daylight hours
when they are truly hungry.  
They have excellent night vision and terrifyingly superior hearing and
smell, and they hunt naturally even on a cloudy new moon night.  
  
They become most active after dusk and into the night, for about two
hours.  
This is after the diurnal beasts have started to fall asleep.  
They then roam for a few hours, searching for prey, and once satisfied,
they sleep again on the spot.  
They often sleep under trees to avoid rain, but apparently, they don't
hide in any particular way.  
  
The Suiko is the king of the forest.  
Almost the only creatures that dare to attack them in the forest are
their own kind.  
In ancient times, many magical beasts were said to exist here, but due
to the presence of Suikos, many of them either fled to other lands or
were eaten.  
Only the Ranka and the stormwing remain.  
  
Excluding dragons, the Stormwing exists at the pinnacle of this mountain
range, but throughout history, only one has ever soared the skies at a
time.  
This is likely due to the vastness of its territory—if two were to exist
simultaneously, it was believed that they would fight until one was
eaten or fled far away.  
Therefore, they are like a natural disaster that does not directly
impact the balance of power in this land.  
  
The Ranka is prey that even Suikos hunt at great risk.  
They often acknowledge each other but maintain distance, protecting
their respective territories.  
Magical beast territories are vast—thus, these two types of magical
beasts extensively dominated and filled these mountains, and Kre'Sharana
built its settlements in the gaps between them.  
  
Problems always arise when that balance is disrupted.  
For example, if a hungry Suiko attacks an Ranka in an adjacent mountain,
the resulting distortion cascades, affecting even the areas around the
settlements.  
A single distortion becomes a large ripple, impacting all these
mountains.  
Those most affected are the people of Kre'Sharana, who reside in the
gaps within these territories.  
  
Three days ago, there was a report of an Ranka rampage a little to the
west of here.  
Griffon Knights search for Suiko around the settlement, but further
away, they search for Ranka.  
Ranka, said to have existed in history with a shoulder height of twenty
feet, were nearly twice the size of even large Suikos.   
Their territories were ideal landmarks; when they and Suiko fight, the
surrounding trees are invariably mowed down, making it immediately
noticeable.  
  
Further west—many beasts fled from the soaring Stormwing and likely
began to encroach on other territories.  
Magical beasts, in particular, are fast.  
The propagation of the wave also proportionally increases with their
speed.  
  
The entire settlement was on edge, and the women had begun sleeping in
the warehouse.  
They stopped gathering and hunting, and all cooking and eating was done
together in the center of the settlement.  
Even Lira and some of the women, who usually cared for griffins and knew
how to ride them, ascended into the sky during the day, ensuring someone
was always airborne.  
  
However, even this must be normal life for the people of Kre'Sharana.  
Neither the men nor the women showed any signs of fear or trembling;
they spent their time laughing as usual.  
The women used their free time to make costumes and decorations for a
feast, saying that when they got through this, there would be a
celebration.  
The men, too, were excited, discussing who they would confess their
feelings to at the next feast.  
  
This was vastly different from a village in wartime.  
He used to go around calming anxious residents, asking, "Is everything
alright here?", but these people were accepting the impending magical
beast attack without fear.  
It meant that each person accepted the danger of death as a familiar
presence.  
This, perhaps, was the strength of Kre'Sharana.  
  
As Argoshe, who had awakened at dusk, was eating, Lira offered him a
fruit, saying, "Please."  
He thanked her and accepted it, sitting next to the log he was using as
a chair.  
  
"The field had beautiful flowers blooming, didn't it?"  
"Ah, yes... Yes. Many people seem to like them."  
  
In this situation, with magical beasts approaching, he was surprised
that she calmly brought up the topic of the field, but he answered.  
The water-drinking potatoes bore many lovely light purple flowers, so
many people liked them.  
  
"You seemed to be picking flowers... Was that for something?"  
"If you thin them out a bit, the potatoes grow larger at harvest time.
If they bear fruit, the nutrients seem to get sucked into them... It's
the wisdom of our ancestors. They don't do much thinning here, do
they?"  
"No, not much... maybe just what's gone bad."  
"Not just potatoes, but fruits and other vegetables too, in some places,
are thinned out a bit before they grow to produce larger, more delicious
ones. That way, the remaining fruit gets more concentrated energy.
...The fruit you ate in the lowlands must have been sweet, right?"  
"Yes, very... I was surprised."  
  
Lira said shyly.  
Argoshe gave a wry smile, remembering Lira's face as her cheeks
softened, putting the fruit to her mouth.  
  
"Those were also grown that way. Even the same fruit can vary greatly in
price depending on how it's grown. Thinning out the poorly grown or
small ones and concentrating the energy on the better fruits... Ah, I
see."  
"…?"  
"There's a connection, I suppose."  
  
Thinning out the weak—the timid—and leaving only the strong.  
The way of Kre'Sharana was exactly like the fruit cultivated in the
Kingdom.  
  
Conversely, in Kre'Sharana, quantity was valued over quality.  
They emphasized an abundance of produce, without thinning.  
  
"Their ways are completely opposite, yet strangely, their cultivation
methods are also opposite.  
The method of cultivating by thinning to produce good fruit is similar
to Kre'Sharana's way of being.  
Abolishing the weak, and thus producing the robust people of
Kre'Sharana, is precisely like that fruit grown in the Kingdom."  
  
He added, "That's probably why they can live in this land."  
  
"Since coming here and observing the people, what surprised me most was
their strength. Just as the Priestess was surprised by the sweetness of
the fruit, I am too. Even now, with the fear of death so close, I can't
believe everyone is living and laughing as usual."  
"...It's not that everyone isn't afraid, but... isn't that true for
Giterns-sama too?"  
"I am a noble. ...I am not permitted to stand by in fear. It is my
obligation to encourage and protect those who are afraid."  
  
He chuckled, "However..."  
  
"There are no such people here. I can understand that the warriors are
like that, but even the women they are supposed to protect accept fear
as a matter of course and still laugh. That wouldn't happen in
Alberan."  
"Death is a familiar thing here. ...It's also proof that Alberan is such
a peaceful and good country."  
  
Lira said quietly, lowering her voice a little so as not to be
overheard.  
  
"Seeing Alberan's prosperity with my own eyes, I thought to myself:
there's war instead of magical beasts, but usually people don't
experience this kind of fear, and many people, strong or weak, are
accepted and seem to live happily."  
  
Lira gazed at the fruit in her hand.  
It was harvested from Kre'Sharana's fields.  
Similar fruits were grown in Alberan, but compared to this one, they
were smaller and less sweet.  
  
"I was born and raised here, and I like this life. But I'm sure even if
I had been born in Alberan, I would have accepted that life just the
same and lived happily. ...In terms of personality, I might even have
adapted too well there."  
  
Lira giggled.  
  
"Some people are born strong like my brother, and some aren't. Many
people say that if you just make an effort, but having that kind of
spirit from childhood is also a kind of natural talent, I think. People
who are called cowards because they dislike fighting can also be
kind-hearted and considerate from a different perspective, and I think
that's also a kind of natural talent."  
  
She continued, toying with the fruit in her hand.  
  
"Just because someone doesn't fit the ideal presented here, if they had
been born in a different land, they might have been an ideal person in
that culture. Thinking about such things makes me sad, and that's why
I... hope there can be a future where such people can live even a little
bit happily."  
"...Priestess, you are a kind person."  
"N-no, I..."  
"When I was the Priestess's age, I only thought of myself."  
  
He gave a wry smile.  
Indeed, that was probably the natural disposition of this young
priestess.  
However, Lira shook her head from side to side, saying, "But I am still
immature."  
  
"Even when I think it's for others and for the future, ultimately, it's
for myself... I'm just thinking that it would be good if it became a
comfortable place for me. That's why I can't have a clear will or
purpose, and I'm weak and indecisive... I'm easily swayed."  
  
She lowered her eyes and smiled, "Ever since I became a priestess, it's
really..."  
  
"The previous Priestess was a wonderful person. She was dignified, yet
gentle, and genuinely respected by everyone..."  
"…Yes."  
"She truly embodied the ideal of Kre'Sharana, and everyone said that we
should all strive to be like her."  
  
"But," she continued.  
  
"No one sought to succeed her. While the duty of honoring the Holy
Spirit and dedicating one's life to training is the most wonderful and
ideal thing, when the opportunity arose, not a single person came
forward willingly."  
"...That's probably true."  
  
There were no plays, no entertainers visiting, no engrossing books.  
In Alberan, for example, building wealth, gaining fame, or power might
be great pleasures.  
  
But here, they didn't exist.  
In this environment where there was no entertainment other than
self-improvement, surely the greatest joy in life was to marry a loved
one, establish a family, and have children.  
Not many people would be able to willingly let go of that future.  
  
"My becoming a priestess was, in the end, out of sheer stubbornness.
While I genuinely believed the previous priestess's way of being was
beautiful, I simply didn't want to see myself as pathetic, afraid to
walk the same path... Deep down, I can't say there was absolutely no
expectation that someone else would step forward first."  
  
Lira was a beautiful girl.  
On top of that, she was good-natured, hardworking, and thoughtful—if she
wished, such happiness would have been promised in her future.  
She was not yet twenty, probably just barely ten at the time.  
At an age where one "loved love," it was easy to imagine how painful it
must have been to willingly give that up.  
  
"And so I became a priestess in name only, hoping that by becoming one,
I too would change... But even now, I remain unchanged. I'm just tracing
the form of a Holy Spirit Priestess, putting on a front... I can hardly
call myself a respectable person."  
  
Lira's demeanor, as she spoke with such shame, was too pure.  
*Beautiful*, he truly thought.  
  
"My father used to say that a person only needs to fulfill one
obligation."  
"Obligation..."  
"Yes. Regardless of one's birthright or the extent of one's talent,
there is only one thing to do in one's lifetime, he always told me. To
cultivate good crops, to provide for one's family, to fight for one's
life on the battlefield... whatever it may be, as long as that person
has a sense of obligation and pride in it, there is no distinction of
noble or common, superior or inferior."  
  
"Everything is a grand process," Argoshe stated.  
  
"In the long sweep of history, our time is short. One person sincerely
living out one life is, from history's perspective, a tiny, almost
unnoticeable event. Of course, there are individuals like Her Majesty
the Queen or Alberinea who carve an indelible name in history and alter
its course... but not everyone is like that."  
"…Yes."  
"A single lifetime is a known thing. That's why, within one's own
capabilities, simply fulfilling the role given to oneself with all one's
might... that is a person's duty. And that conclusion, he told me, you
can think about when you've lived your entire life, on your deathbed."  
  
Even now, he still didn't know if he could surpass it in this
lifetime.  
His father was such a great man.  
In the world, he was probably just a rural noble.  
He wasn't a genius overflowing with rare talent, nor was he a special
being.  
But to Argoshe, his father was the greatest presence of all.  
  
"I am still immature. I am weak and timid, and even though I have lived
far longer than the Priestess, I often get lost, and there are days I am
at a loss, days I make mistakes. But that is also part of the process...
It's too early for an immature person like me to seek results."  
  
To his father, he was still a mere youth.  
And he probably would be until the day he died.  
Perhaps his father was scolding his foolish son amidst their mingled
blood.  
  
"Humans enter through form. And content is poured in only when there is
a vessel. The Priestess, walking with the image of your great
predecessor in your mind, will surely become a fitting person over the
years. An ideal is the very guide that determines the shape of one's
vessel and leads it."  
"..., Yes."  
"The same goes for me... I'm halfway on a path to become an ideal
version of myself, one that my great father and beloved younger brother
would recognize. Just as the Holy Spirit Priestess's duty is for you,
for me it is simply the obligation of a noble. ...Surely, that's true
for everyone; it's true for your father and brother too."  
  
Lira thought for a while, then chuckled, her shoulders shaking.  
  
"My brother often said something similar. ...That he trains every day to
make his own vessel larger."  
"Yes. Surely, he holds a high ideal... perhaps even the image of the
Holy Spirit herself. ...Likewise, without rushing, the Priestess will
surely get there eventually."  
"...Thank you."  
  
Lira nodded quietly.  
Then, she gave another wry smile.  
  
"I'm sorry. Somehow, instead of being considerate, I ended up causing
you to be considerate of me."  
"No. Thanks to you, I feel a bit more relaxed... I've been stiff with
tension lately, what with all the talk of attacks. You've helped me. You
must be tired, Priestess... Please rest a little."  
"...Yes."  
  
—Humans are, after all, creatures of form.  
He smiled wryly, watching her bow and leave.  
His words were as if he was telling himself that that was how it should
be. 
<br /><br />

  
―It was at night when he heard the shouts of "Ranka and Suiko!"  
Roars that shook the air threatened the forest's silence.  
  
"Cax, Debel's squad, go to the rooftops!"  
"Yes, sir!"  
  
The resonant clang of the tiger bell.  
From the high platform of the watchtower, he checked the flag color of
watchtower number seven, then barked orders to his subordinates who had
sprung up and gathered.  
Eleven people were too cramped on the watchtower roof—their positions
had been decided beforehand.  
  
But the roar sent shivers down his spine.  
He was used to the Suiko's distant roars, but the terror of an Suiko
roaring right in front of him was entirely different.  
He could see from this height how the giant trees were snapping one
after another, accompanied by screaming sounds and ground tremors.  
  
The Suiko was attacking a Ranka.  
And it was clearly heading towards them, mowing down trees as it came.  
  
Above them, Bege and the Griffon Knights were already visible, with a
few more knights on top of this very watchtower.  
Lira, along with other women accustomed to riding griffins, had also
ascended into the sky, trying to grasp the situation.  
  
"—Here it comes!"  
  
It burst forth, having mowed down the western forest.  
It was a Ranka.  
Valiant horns, almost bursting through the trees, sprouted from its
head, and it charged wildly with a colossal body like a hut.   
Spears like twigs were stuck in its back, but it seemed not to notice.  
  
The monster's massive body, visible even from a distance, easily crushed
watchtower number seven, which was far away, and men on the watchtower
were seen tumbling and leaping from the collapsing structure.  
The men waiting at the forest's edge threw countless spears.  
Even those failed to claim its life, and the Ranka charged on.  
  
Another monster burst forth from behind it.  
The roaring Suiko dodged the magic wielder's spear, and one of the men
was flung by its massive body for nearly twenty ken.   
He saw him rolling an unbelievable distance.  
  
He looked at his surrounding guards.  
Their entire bodies were stiff, and their lips were pale even in the
glow of the bonfires.  
It was understandable.  
They were all excellent, but only among humans.  
Magical beasts were monsters that could easily wipe out a century.  
  
"Don't worry. Compared to the Holy Spirit, they are merely beasts."  
"Marquis..."  
"Just follow the training. Even if we have to fight, it's just to buy
time... Kre'Sharana's warriors are brave warriors who do not fear
magical beasts. We just need to move as trained."  
  
He smiled and clapped the men on the shoulders.  
Strongly, as if to hide his own trembling.  
Then he spoke, including the men on the roof.  
  
"Let me tell you this first! Even if you suffer grave injuries and lose
limbs, Giterns will not forget that debt of gratitude! I swear by the
name of Argoshe Wikel Giterns that I will surely provide rewards
commensurate with your distinguished service! Do not worry that your
families will be left destitute, I will take care of everything!!"  
  
When he raised his voice, asking "Understood?", the men clicked their
heels and placed a hand on their chests.  
Argoshe also returned the salute.  
  
"There's nothing to fear, they're just big cats and deer! They're no
match for humans!"  
  
The men rushed after the charging Ranka, and the Suiko also ran beside
it.  
Despite countless spears impaling it, the Ranka showed no sign of
stopping.  
A literal monster.  
And the Suiko, too, seemed to be dodging the spears as if using the
Ranka's massive body as a shield.  
  
He remembered the Suiko that Alberinea kept.  
It was probably highly intelligent.  
He had heard such stories, but this was beyond imagination—the idea of
using one's own prey as cover against an enemy was extraordinary.  
  
A voice echoed, demanding it stop, but the Ranka charged onward.  
He clenched his fist, thinking, *Bad luck.* It intended to break through
the center of the settlement.  
  
Huts were no obstacle to it.  
The Ranka pressed forward, ignoring the huts—mowing down houses and
letting out enraged screams.  
Even the warriors following behind couldn't keep up with the Ranka's
speed, and warriors on the central watchtower began leaping down, spears
in hand.  
  
"Roq! You stay! The other two, to the empty watchtowers!"  
"Yes, sir!"  
  
Insufficient skill and experience—they would only be in the way in a
fight.  
The two immediately descended the watchtower and went to another.  
Meanwhile, Bege and the others flew in front of the advancing Ranka's
face, diverting it away from the warehouse where the women were
sheltering.  
  
The Ranka veered sharply to the right of the warehouse, likely
disappearing into the northeast forest.  
Just as he felt relieved, he saw fragments of the destroyed house hit
the warehouse.  
  
"Keep watch! Cax, Debel! Come!"  
  
He shouted, leaping from the watchtower towards the warehouse.  
There was a large hole in the warehouse wall—looking inside, he saw
children, old men, and women holding spears.  
There was also a young man, probably an artisan.  
The old men and the young man, along with some of the women, had their
spears ready.  
  
"Any injuries!?"  
"Minor. What about outside?"  
  
It was the Elder—Beikiru—who answered.  
His flesh was falling away, and he had little time left to live.  
The old man, who should have been lying down during the meeting, stood
perfectly poised with a spear at the front of the hole, asking. His eyes
and stance radiated the fierce aura of a valiant warrior.  
  
"The Ranka bypassed the north slightly, the Suiko is around it... The
warriors are pursuing them, Elder."  
"The watchtowers?"  
"My subordinates are in the open watchtowers."  
"...Thank you."  
  
He coughed in reply, and Beikiru knelt.  
Argoshe quickly supported him and spoke.  
  
"Debel, your squad will also guard here until the situation calms down.
...Those who can wield a spear, please gather. We'll form a makeshift
wall."  
  
They exchanged glances for a moment, then took up their spears and moved
to the front of the hole.  
At the same time, he entrusted Beikiru to a woman who approached.  
It was an astonishing display of mental fortitude.  
With a body barely able to stand, he had taken up a spear to protect
those behind him.  
  
"Debel, form a makeshift phalanx."  
"Yes, sir!"  
"Those with spears, stand behind these men and thrust your spears
through the gaps in their bodies. If we make a solid wall of spears, at
least nothing will get in from here."  
"Ngh..., as he... says..."  
  
Beikiru coughed as he spoke, then looked at Argoshe.  
  
"...Thank you."  
"No thanks needed. ...It's only natural."  
  
Debel and the others readied their spears, and those behind them thrust
their spearheads through the gaps.  
As he watched, he heard the beating of griffin wings—it was Lira.  
  
"Giterns-sama, the people inside?"  
"They seem to be safe, a few minor injuries. No problems for now."  
"That's good..."  
  
He nodded to Lira, who had landed in the central plaza in front of the
warehouse and let out a sigh of relief.  
Then he looked next to him.  
  
"Cax, climb to another empty watchtower. I'll be right there."  
"Understood! Let's go!"  
  
Seeing Cax and the others run off, Argoshe asked Lira,  
  
"The Ranka and Suiko?"  
"Northeast—both towards watchtower number two.  
The warriors are pursuing them, so it's probably—"  
  
And just as she started to speak, the bell from the west rang again.  
  
"Marquis! Another Suiko through the path just now!"  
"Tch..."  
"Please, flee immediately!"  
  
He looked west—it was quite a distance away, but he knew what it was
because he saw the glow of its eyes, even in the night.   
What he instinctively understood was that it had recognized Argoshe.  
A chilling shiver ran up his spine.  
  
To his immediate left was the warehouse—the figures of Debel and the
others, spears at the ready.  
The Suiko, having found its prey, would undoubtedly come this way.  
If Argoshe hid himself here, that Suiko would naturally follow him, pass
through this path, and realize there were people inside.  
In that case, which would it target?  
  
"Priestess, to the sky."  
"But—"  
"If I lose my life, I want you to tell my wife that her husband fought
bravely and died."  
"..."  
  
There was a moment's pause, then the beat of a griffin's wings.  
  
"...Understood. Please be safe."  
  
Suppressing the tremor in his body, he picked up and gripped the wine
bottle hanging from his waist.  
Then, from his left hip, he drew his heirloom sword.  
The Giterns family sword, passed down through generations, was polished
to a gleam, with hardly any flaws.  
It had been inherited for three hundred years.  
  
This treasured sword was a symbol of Giterns.  
The Giterns were not a martial family and did not approve of wielding a
sword for glory.  
It was purely for the protection of the weak.  
This sword was drawn and wielded only when the head of the family risked
his life to fulfill that obligation.  
  
"...Giterns-sama."  
"Rest assured, I will surely buy time."  
  
He told Debel, who was holding a spear, and took a half-stance with his
sword.  
With a light, almost running stride—but at a surprisingly fast pace—he
faced the approaching Suiko directly, breathing deeply with
concentration.  
Tension made his breathing shallow.  
He inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly, as if to release the stiffness in
his body.  
  
He closed his eyes for just a moment.  
He imagined the beautiful sword his brother wielded.  
The Giterns' sword, which pursued the ideal his brother spoke of.  
He prayed that the sword that always appeared in his mind would, at this
very moment, rest in his hand.  
  
Opening his eyelids, he faced the Suiko, which was now in a full
charge.  
  
"...That is my obligation."  
  
To be the ideal noble his brother loved.
