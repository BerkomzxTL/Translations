## Chapter 321: Obligation – The End

Three months of staying passed, and exchanges with Kre'Sharana continued
smoothly afterwards.  
Scholars were invited to examine the land, and attempts were made to
cultivate new seedlings there.  
Since they only accepted practical goods like alcohol, people with
skills and knowledge were brought.  
  
Alberan's rich technology had been refined through many cultural
exchanges.  
Their skill, having achieved unique technological progress in isolation,
was by no means immature, but Alberan's artisans like blacksmiths and
carpenters, and scholars, possessed broader knowledge.  
  
Even if they couldn't fight, these were people dedicated to the pursuit
of knowledge and skill throughout their lives.  
Alberan gained its collective strength based on their endeavors.  
Whether directly or indirectly, though their battlefields differed, they
too were respected warriors, and the people of Kre'Sharana gradually
began to accept their existence.  
  
Those who dedicate themselves to their knowledge or craft wer no
different from those who dedicated themselves to the sword or spear.  
*If the sword I forged turns out dull, I will thrust the blade into
myself and die.*  
Some old blacksmiths declare this boldly, as if challenging fate.  
*If my proposed method is wrong, I wouldn't mind being killed.*  
Some scholars declare this calmly, with a smile.  
From a warrior's perspective, they were individuals who couldn't even
become squires in Kre'Sharana, but voices disparaging their existence
quickly faded.  
  
Their conviction and resolve, which spared no life, and their pride in
their own pursuits.  
It was precisely because they disliked ostentation and valued inner
qualities that they understood.  
If there is a superiority among people, it resides within their
hearts.  
Never in their outward appearance.  
  
Their way of life, which placed no value on those who couldn't fight,
was indispensable in that harsh land.  
Otherwise, it would be a land where even survival was difficult.  
Their culture was synonymous with life itself; no one could question its
rightness or wrongness.  
  
However, it was different now.  
They no longer needed to be isolated in that harsh land.  
The option of moving to a more livable land could exist in their
future.  
They could find meaning beyond just fighting, be needed, and be allowed
to be proud.  
The possibility of such a future was what Argoshe wanted to convey.  
  
*"Individuals like Krische-sama appeared, and individuals like Her
Majesty the Queen appeared, and then individuals like you appeared... We
will surely slowly fade away. But, Giterns-dono, there is no need for
you to worry. For we shall fade away of our own accord"*  
  
Vinthril and the others spoke thus.  
  
*"Besides, if there are those like Giterns-dono, born outside, who
lament our passing and find our way of life beautiful... then even in
the future after we have faded, our way of life will surely be inherited
in some form. By someone's hand, for as long as it is needed."*  
  
They accepted their own demise with a smile, saying it was fine.  
Argoshe truly thought they were strong people.  
For that reason, and so that they wouldn't regret it, Argoshe busied
himself.  
  
And so, day by day, he deepened his exchanges with Kre'Sharana,
communicating many times through letters.  
He entrusted the affairs of his territory to his splendidly grown sons,
and his days, though busy, were fulfilling—then, one day, Anne sent him
two books.  
  
"At the Noble Hawk's Mansion..."  
  
The binding was beautiful, with a stately black leather and silver
thread embroidery—two volumes.  
The delivery person simply said it was an item requested by Anne, and
there was no letter in the package.  
He was dumbfounded, wondering if she had forgotten to include a letter,
but also pondered why she would specifically send him books.  
As usual, he was troubled by his daughter's eccentricities on the sofa
in his private room.  
  
Perhaps it was a truly good book, good enough to go to the trouble of
sending it.  
If so, he could understand.  
Although he wasn't particularly fond of books, Argoshe collected various
books for self-improvement and usually read when he spent time at
home.  
The mansion had a rather splendid library, and there was a high
possibility that Anne misunderstood him as a great book lover, so
choosing books as a gift for her father was not strange.  
In fact, some of the servants also thought Argoshe liked books, and in
any case, it could be said that his being a reader was an objective
fact.  
  
If anything, he only read books as a part of his studies and
education.  
If asked again if he liked books, he couldn't say yes, but if asked if
he disliked books, he would say he didn't.  
Broadly speaking, he was someone who liked books—and if it was a gift
from his daughter, he was interested enough to wonder what kind of book
it was.  
  
"You, what did the letter say—?"  
  
Black bean tea and cookies on a tray.  
His wife, Raina, who had returned, gazed at the book in Argoshe's hand
and tilted her head.  
Her tea-colored hair hung loosely in front of her neck, and although
some signs of age were visible, she was still his lovely and adorable,
proud wife.  
Dressed in a simple navy one-piece dress, even as the wife of the
Marquis Giterns, she still baked cookies herself and diligently worked
on the mansion's cooking and laundry, just as she had when she was a
servant.  
  
He had tried to stop her, saying she was his wife now, but she seemed
uncomfortable being taken care of—ultimately, Argoshe relented.  
In fact, what attracted Argoshe himself was her hardworking and caring
nature.  
Seeing Raina unchanged always calmed him, and he left his personal
affairs to his wife.  
  
Perhaps growing up seeing such a mother also had a great influence on
Anne.  
Thinking this, he showed her the book and gave a wry smile, saying only
the book had been sent.  
Well, she too smiled wryly.  
  
"Did she forget to put in a letter?"  
"Probably something like that. Typical Anne."  
"Fufu, even serving at Her Majesty the Queen's side, her clumsiness
hasn't changed, has it?"  
  
Relaxing her mouth, Raina took the lower volume, briefly checked its
contents, and frowned.  
  
"...This, is this her handwriting?"  
"Anne's?"  
  
Finally opening the book, the first thing that caught his eye was the
table of contents.  
  
Prologue—From Anne Giterns to Royal Household Servant.  
Chapter 1—Ideal and Reality. And the Eternal Goal, the Encounter with a
Great Servant.  
Chapter 2—The War of the Crowns and the Noble Hawk Princesses.  
Chapter 3—  
  
Argoshe was dumbfounded. 
<br /><br />

  
Was this an autobiography or something?  
He imagined his beloved daughter confidently sending her father a
mysterious autobiography, and while he was exasperated, he accepted it,
thinking it was entirely possible for Anne.  
Anne was someone who occasionally did unexpected things.  
According to Raina, she sometimes had deep thoughts (though sometimes
they were just impulses), but it was difficult for Argoshe, who had
watched her since she was a baby, to discern her true intentions.  
  
Indeed, the handwriting was Anne's.  
Anne's writing, which had a slightly fastidious quality, was neat and
polite.  
It was not bad even when compared to professional scribes.  
  
However, one's personality shows in their writing.  
During the civil war, Selene's handwriting, sent to Argoshe regarding
Anne, was a powerful and dignified script that conveyed the bravery and
strong will of Christand, Lightning Quick's daughter.  
  
The head maid, Bery, who had sent letters several times on her behalf,
had elegant, refined, and delicate handwriting.  
A permit that Alberinea had once entrusted to Kre'Sharana was so
identical to hers that it was indistinguishable, and the handwriting
suggested she had learned from and imitated Bery.  
  
Queen Kreschenta's handwriting was exactly what you'd expect from a
queen.  
It was vivid and beautiful, clearly expressing variations in speed,
strength, and weakness. While all were beautiful, her inner self seeped
through as a distinct style.  
  
Anne's handwriting, too, conveyed her meticulous nature.  
Overall, it was beautiful and well-written, but it subtly conveyed a
slightly pretentious aspect, as if she was trying a bit too hard to
create an impressive script, paying attention to appearance.  
Unlike the other four, whose styles were naturally developed, Anne's
characters, which strived to express beauty through effort, had a charm
that was distinctly Anne's.  
  
The table of contents was strong and dignified like Selene's. When
explaining others' good points it was flamboyant like Kreschenta. Her
usual handwriting attempted to imitate Bery's fluidity but with a slight
awkwardness, as if she was forcing herself to imitate the flowing
lines.  
Just looking at it, the image of Anne with her strange strong
preferences came to mind, and it was somehow amusing.  
  
However, the more he read the content, the more worried he became.  
It spoke of the people he had met since heading to the royal territory,
with the Christand family as the main subject.  
Basically, everything was the highest praise imaginable.  
While speaking about their personalities was not bad, he couldn't quite
understand what she wanted to achieve by having her father read
sentences like *"Bery, though petite, has ample breasts and a beautiful
waistline,"* or *"Selene's slender body is as attractive as a lithe
cat."*  
He understood she was praising their appearance, but it was an utterly
unnecessary sentence.  
And then, when the Queen and Alberinea, who were royalty, were added, he
started to worry about Anne.  
  
"That girl, really..."  
"Well, it's very Anne-like, isn't it?"  
  
Raina, who had been peeking at the book from beside him, chuckled as
Argoshe held his head in his hands.  
He had understood to some extent what kind of people they were when he
met them the other day, and he could see that they were kind to Anne and
felt affectionate towards her.  
The more he learned about their lives and their daily routines through
the book, the more he understood how much Anne loved them, and how much
they cared for his daughter.  
Considering this, they probably wouldn't be enraged or punish her for
writing this book, but still, the content was terrifying—at least, not
something that could be shown to others.  
  
Moving to the second volume, the content became even more radical.  
  
*"Her Majesty the Queen, who, as usual, was sitting on Argan-sama's lap,
being made to mimic a dog and spoiled—"*  
  
And so on, scattered throughout the narrative of their daily lives were
inexplicable, nonchalant mentions of the extraordinary.  
After finishing the book, he was determined that it must be sealed or
burned, yet he didn't stop reading.  
He found himself turning page after page, drawn by Anne's emotions
seeping through the chaotic daily life of the mansion that she
described.  
  
When he considered why she recounted her life from birth to her daily
routine in the mansion with such apparent enjoyment, he began to grasp
the reason why this book was written.  
  
"I need to start preparing dinner soon... Let me read the rest later."  
"Ah, go ahead."  
  
Even after Raina left, he continued to turn the pages.  
The content expressed in the writing was probably only a small
fragment.  
He imagined the many interactions that must have occurred between the
lines as he read on.  
  
Bery being stabbed, and the everyday life that felt extinguished until
Krische returned with the dragon.  
Their struggles and mental fatigue during the Five Great Nations War
were touched upon, and because their usual daily life was depicted so
brightly and oddly, those moments stood out even more.  
Towards the end, there was increasing mention of Galen, Krische's
adopted grandfather, which subtly led to a realization.  
  
The elderly man whom Anne revered, often mentioned in their daily
life.  
A martial artist from a hunting background, genuinely admired even by
Krische, an undeniable genius, and respected by many military
personnel.  
He was around the same age as Argoshe—but he wasn't a magic wielder, and
it was probably because of him that his daughter wrote this book-shaped
letter.  
Argoshe had heard that he had passed away a little while ago.  
  
Anne recounted each of the things she learned from him and the things he
taught her as if they were precious treasures, and these entries became
more frequent as the book neared its end.  
And so, when the death of Galen was recorded, Anne finally began to
speak about the book itself.  
  
She recounted how she was born to admirable parents and surrounded by
wonderful people, yet she felt she was an ordinary person, incomparable
to them.  
And she recalled Argoshe's words, and pondered what her future should
be.  
The future of marrying a good gentleman, starting a family, and raising
children was certainly a happy one, and unlike them, she was a very
ordinary woman with no special talents.  
She wondered if she was too unsuitable to spend her life in this
glamorous world.  
  
*"Galen-sama said that I, who claimed to be ordinary, was actually a
special presence in this glamorous world, and that someone like me was
very important to this mansion. He said that not only are those who
string the bow needed, but sometimes those who loosen it are too...
because everyone in this mansion strains the string too much."*  
  
The daily life depicted featured characters like those in a picture
book.  
The royal sister and the queen, worthy of being called children of
God.  
The servant who spoiled the two like children.  
The noble lady who became a marshal at fifteen and fulfilled that role
as a matter of course.  
Even the servant she called her rival was extraordinarily talented, and
everyone associated with them naturally possessed something
exceptional.  
  
*"Argan-sama also says that I'm always helping her, even though I'm
constantly causing trouble instead of being helpful, and can't do
anything right. She says with a laugh that sometimes you need someone
who makes the master angry or bothers them. I don't know if she means
the same thing, but she says such things to me."*  
  
Her heart was probably the same.  
Anne had many flaws, but she was a good daughter Argoshe could be proud
of.  
He believed that they truly saw Anne's good qualities.  
  
*"I don't think I'm a respectable person who is needed by anyone, as
those people say. I think they say such things to comfort me, trying to
be considerate, but even so, I hope that there's even a little truth I
haven't noticed in their words. I wanted to believe that if someone like
me could be of even a little use to those people."*  
  
As he had intuited mid-way through, this was a farewell letter.  
A letter indicating that she had made a decision about her life from her
own will.  
  
*"Of course, it might be my foolish misunderstanding. Perhaps they are
thoroughly exasperated, and I might someday be driven out of the
mansion. But until that time comes, I wish to serve the revered
individuals in this mansion, striving to my utmost—"*  
  
That's why, upon reading that sentence,  
  
*"—and fulfill my obligations as a servant."*  
  
Argoshe pressed his fingers to his eyes.  
  
*"Father, who is still risking his life in a distant land, fulfilling a
difficult obligation. Mother, who gently taught me many things and
watched over me. And my brothers, to whom I may cause much worry. But,
as one of the nobles born into the Giterns family, inherited from our
ancestors, I have decided in my heart to dedicate an unchanging vow, for
all eternity, to this precious name given to me."*  
  
—Please, forgive your selfish daughter.  
  
He pictured Anne's face, heard her words of resolve, and lowered his
head.  
Yet, he couldn't hold back his tears, which trickled down his nose.  
  
*"From the Noble Hawk's Mansion, with love from Anne Giterns, child of
my beloved Father and Mother."*  
  
He pressed his sleeve to his eyes at these words written at the end of
the book.  
Until Raina's knock echoed, calling him for dinner.  
Raina, who came to call him, nestled beside Argoshe and gently stroked
his head, smiling wryly, "What's wrong, you're old enough to know
better."  
  
"Later, read it."  
"Yes. ...Was it something sad?"  
  
"No," he shook his head, sniffled, and looked up.  
  
"It's the most joyous letter, truly. ...As the head of the Giterns
family, I couldn't be prouder."  
  
Then, closing the book, he traced the letters on the cover.  
  
"As a father, it's a little lonely... that kind of letter."  
"...I see."  
  
At the Noble Hawk's Mansion—and now, from the Noble Hawk's Mansion.  
  
"Let's go when you've calmed down. The food will get cold."  
"Ah, sorry."  
  
Leaving the mansion where she was born and raised, Anne was now cemented
in its history. 
<br /><br />

  
The next day, Argoshe wrote a letter and returned to his routine.  
He tirelessly traveled to various regions, meeting scholars, artisans,
and merchants, and commuting between his mansion and Kre'Sharana as a
bridge between them.  
  
He was concerned that the round trip took too much time and was
difficult, so after a while, a warrior began staying at Argoshe's
mansion, partly to study lowland culture.  
If one flew from the foot of the mountain, Kre'Sharana could be reached
in less than half a day.  
It wasn't the case for large groups, but they gradually became
cooperative, with several warriors providing escort for a few people,
making the journey much more peaceful.  
  
During a major plan to cooperate with the Alberan army—to create a path
between Alberan and Kre'Sharana—they suffered damage from magical
beasts, and he was plagued by stomachaches.  
But when he was tired, he would look at the book Anne had sent him,
repeatedly reviewing the words written there, and refresh his spirits.  
  
Moreover, the Queen wasn't entirely leaving everything to him.  
When large plans were underway, Alberinea would occasionally appear,
riding an Suiko with a nonchalant air, solving difficult problems as if
they were nothing, and then returning, saying she was busy with work at
the mansion.  
  
As Anne had been worred about the Stormwing, it was hunted as a welcome
gift to Kre'Sharana, and near the planned road, nearly ten magical
beasts were hunted in just half a day.  
Seeing Alberinea solve problems that plagued Argoshe as if they were
"just a small errand," there were times when he wondered if his presence
truly had meaning, but even so, Argoshe had no choice but to earnestly
fulfill his obligation.  
  
When he felt the presence of the extraordinary Alberinea and the Queen,
he understood his own insignificance.  
The existence of Bery, beloved and adored by them, and Selene, who
naturally lived as the mistress of the mansion where they resided.  
They were literally figures above the clouds, residents of a storybook
world. Thinking of his beloved daughter's daily life with them, and of
Anne Giterns, who had sworn to her obligation and her name, there was no
time in his life to sit idle.  
  
For his proud daughter, as a proud father.  
Just as Anne sought to fulfill her obligation, so too did he.  
To remember this, he turned the pages of the book countless times until
they were worn.  
  
After reading that letter, his reply was as a noble.  
  
He could not allow any more of such strictly guarded forbidden books to
be created.  
The majority of the letter was filled with reprimands for Anne regarding
the content she had written, telling her to reform her mindset as the
Queen's servant and repeating that she should never write anything
similar again.  
And at the end,  
  
*"Above all, I earnestly wish that Anne Giterns fulfills her
obligations. Though in a distant land, as a noble who, like her, carries
the Giterns name, and as a father who, with his proud daughter, seeks to
fulfill his  own—"*  
  
—With love for the servant who will open this at the Noble Hawk's
Mansion.  
  
He recalled writing those words every time he turned a page, renewing
his resolve.  
  
He was an ordinary, insignificant person. But that was no reason to
abandon his obligations.  
  
He was himself, and whether he had talent or not, everyone simply
fulfilled the obligations corresponding to the abilities they were
given.  
There was no difference for the Queen, for Alberinea, no matter how
blessed they were, or even if they could easily solve many people's
problems.  
Each of them surely had their own struggles and hardships, and it was
precisely for that reason that they would even challenge a dragon,
risking their lives.  
  
To do one's best for something more important than oneself.  
In that, there was no superiority or inferiority whatsoever.  
  
He would face it honestly and earnestly, and he didn't care if he was
embarrassed or ridiculed.  
Even if it was undignified or pathetic, he would still devote his
efforts and proudly declare,  
  
"Do you like making a fool of yourself, you idiot? How many times have
you been sent rolling? You have no sense and your movements are slow.
It's the same thing over and over, no matter how many years I deal with
you... If it's too painful and you want to quit, you can complain all
you want."  
"No, please, one more time, Dukaran-dono."  
"Then move your body before you move your mouth. Whether it's a cowardly
ambush or whatever, fight desperately and take even one point from me.
Even if you make a fool of yourself and crawl on the ground, if you get
results, I'll evaluate you."  
"Yes, sir!"  
  
He smiled and proudly stated that such was his obligation.  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

※Stormwing Subjugation Battle  
  
"…There's a Stormwing nest on this cliff face."  
  
Above the sleeping Stormwing's nest—silver hair seated behind
Vinthril.  
Krische looked down with a surprised, "Oh, wow."  
  
The Stormwing's nest was located in a large hollow at the top of a
towering, sheer cliff.  
The Stormwing was said to be sleeping quietly deep within a massive,
jaw-like fissure in the cliff face.  
  
This place was originally a mountain, said to have been carved out by
battles between dragons.  
In fact, the cliff was a complete mountain when viewed from the opposite
side, and traces of melted rock could be seen on the cliff face.  
Presumably, the hollow was also formed by that impact.  
For centuries, the reason even the Stormwing, which should have been
defeated once, made this place its stronghold was unknown, but perhaps
there was some reason they didn't know, or perhaps it was due to its
intelligence.  
  
Vinthril slowly descended onto the cliff top from above, so as not to
reveal their presence, and began to explain.  
  
"I've heard that in ancient times, there were brave individuals who
directly entered the nest. However, the large, jaw-like fissure in the
cliff... there's a bit of a distance to the deep part where the
Stormwing sleeps, and they were repelled without being able to get close
due to its flapping..."  
"Flapping..."  
"Literally, it's like a storm that mows down forests. It would probably
be inferior to Yagernaus-sama's, but even in human form, there would
have been no way to deal with the storm unleashed in that confined
space. ...At that time, the awakened and enraged Stormwing caused
significant damage to the settlement."  
"Hmm... That's tough."  
  
It would not be easy to defeat the Stormwing within that nest.  
For the Stormwing, which could conjure a storm with a single flap of its
wings, this wide and deep cliff fissure was an ideal environment to
easily repel any intruders.  
With just one of its wing-conjured storms, it could simply push an
opponent into the air.  
  
He knew of Krische's godlike skill, comparable even to a Holy Spirit,
but entering was too dangerous.  
First, Vinthril and the others would act as decoys, somehow luring it
out of the nest—and then she would take it down the moment the Stormwing
exposed itself outside the cliff.  
That was probably the optimal solution.  
  
"Yes. So we'll be the decoys—"  
"Alright, Krische will be right back."  
"Krische-sama!?"  
  
Before he could stop her.  
Krische, gripping her spear, simply leaped down the almost vertical
cliff face.  
  
—Did she even listen to what he said?  
Dumbfounded, Vinthril and the others mounted their griffins and hastily
plummeted, but couldn't catch up.  
  
"—!?"  
  
The moment Krische's hand gripped the upper edge of the fissure and she
disappeared inside, an unearthly shriek that froze one's insides
echoed—and then, it instantly ceased, followed by a tremor.  
What Vinthril and the others finally saw when they caught up was the
monstrous bird, deep within the giant fissure. It was in the middle of
collapsing, its wings spread, and its head severed from its neck.  
And Krische, holding down her skirt, tilted her head slightly.  
  
"Krische was listening, but it really is quite big, isn't it? Hmm, is it
tasty..."  
  
—A gentle breeze brushed Vinthril and the others' cheeks. 
<br /><br />

  
※Magical Beast Hunting  
  
On the back of a griffon—high above the mountain.  
Krische sat sideways behind Lira, holding a spear and looking down.  
  
"Oh, there's another one. Lira, a little further back."  
"Uh, um, yes... Rainer."  
  
What on earth could she see?  
Lira watched as Krische, still seated, threw her spear straight down at
an alarming speed.  
As the spear disappeared into the gaps between the trees, an Suiko's
shriek echoed.  
The trees swayed and fell, presumably from its thrashing, and then,
after a short while, it stopped.  
  
"The sway caused Krische's aim to be off just a little. What a shame."  
"S-sorry..."  
"No, that was just Krische being clumsy. Uh, you there... Roosa-san.
Krische's taken it down, so please bleed and butcher it."  
"Y-yes, understood..."  
"Hmm, anything else...?"  
  
She said, dangling both her feet, to the bewildered Griffon Knight.  
  
—That day, one Ranka and seven Suikos disappeared from the mountain.
