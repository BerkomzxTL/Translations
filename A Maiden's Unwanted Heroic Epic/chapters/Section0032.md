## Chapter 342: Charm I

When her younger sister was still four years old.  
  
"Oh, Nee-sama..."  
  
The red-haired girl with long hair—Bery—held Lazura's homework.  
She had forgotten it in her room when she visited before dinner.  
Equations filled the parchment.  
Bery sat on the bed, tilting her head as she looked at them.  
  
"Fufu, for Bery, who's just learned her numbers, it's probably
completely foreign."  
"Yes, it's difficult."  
  
Lazura sat beside her, smiling proudly.  
She was exceptionally good at academics, so much so that even her
teachers were surprised.  
She was given new problems, skipping many levels from the easy ones;
Lazura was, at the very least, exceptionally talented—she proudly
believed herself to be a genius.  
  
Her half-sister was also a smart child, similar to herself, but surely
she couldn't understand problems like these yet.  
Smiling smugly, Lazura held up a finger and began.  
  
"Simply put, you use these kinds of equations to add, subtract, and do
various things with numbers to arrive at an answer. When you make them
complex, they look like this—"  
"Oh, so that's how it is."  
  
However, true geniuses do exist.  
It was fortunate for Lazura that she learned this early.  
  
"This is the sign to increase numbers, and this one is to decrease. And
this one shows how many of the left number there are, and this one is
the reverse... right?"  
"Huh? Uh, yes... t-that's right, but..."  
"This combination is for finding this sign... and dividing it like this
probably indicates the order of calculation, and then this is—"  
  
Ignoring the stunned Lazura, Bery fluently explained her interpretation
of the symbols used in the equations.  
It was the same method of solution that Lazura had been taught, yet Bery
furrowed her brow slightly, tilting her head as if not completely
satisfied.  
  
"—That's what I thought, but there are two things I just don't
understand. If I follow that line of thought, the numbers that come out
are always different."  
"W-which ones...?"  
"These two."  
  
Lazura snatched the parchment and re-examined the equations she had
written for a while.  
It took her some time to realize that Bery was pointing out a small
calculation error of Lazura's.  
  
There was a mistake in the calculation—it happened occasionally.  
More than that, Lazura was astonished that Bery, seven years younger
than her, had pointed it out.  
Her sister, who had just been taught numbers and letters, had
effortlessly found the rule from a mere twenty problems and easily
pinpointed Lazura's arithmetic error.  
  
"It didn't work even when I changed the order, so I thought maybe I was
making some big mistake..."  
"...I-I see. But you're right, your answer is correct."  
"Correct...?"  
"Your answers were 7 and 83, weren't they?"  
"Yes. Um..."  
"Fu, fufu, I just tested you a little. To see if Bery could really spot
the mistake."  
  
Bery's adorable face registered surprise, then she smiled.  
"Oh, so that's what it was," she said, putting her hands together, a
little pleased—her red hair, like Lazura's, swaying.  
  
Lazura had thought she was an excellent person.  
But true genius, she realized, was something like her sister.  
Finding patterns without being taught and effortlessly solving difficult
equations.  
Ordinary people simply saw things differently.  
  
Lazura was excellent, but she was no genius.  
Comparing herself to others with pride—the fact that her foolish pride
was broken so early by her little sister, she thought, was perhaps the
greatest fortune of all.  
  
The world was far vaster than her small head could conceive, and she was
but one tiny individual within it. 
<br /><br />

  
Her father had two wives.  
For a noble, this was not unusual; the Argan family was an old house.  
Many nobles valued a long history, and even a baronial house would not
lack for such arrangements.  
Considering the objective of producing an heir, it was probably not even
that many.  
  
It was said that children were difficult to conceive between nobles, and
indeed, the Argan family also faced this issue.  
Due to such circumstances, it was not uncommon for grand noble families
to take four or five wives, and if many children were born to a
daughter's new family, some were often adopted into their birth family
to inherit the house.  
An heir was a matter of life and death for nobles.  
To put it negatively, noble society was built upon a system of
exchanging children among themselves.  
  
However, it was generally true that the relationships between wives were
not particularly good.  
There was a difference in treatment between a lawful wife and a
concubine, and it was natural to want one's own child to inherit the
house.  
Some people simply couldn't accept the fact that their husband loved
someone other than themselves.  
  
Fortunately, both mothers were quite close.  
The mother who gave birth to Lazura died in a riding accident, but the
other mother, despite Lazura not being her own child, raised Lazura as
if she were her true mother.  
Lazura grew up calling that intelligent and kind person "Mother," and
she always happily told Lazura that her true mother was like a wonderful
elder sister.  
  
The Argan family's first child.  
Everyone greatly doted on Lazura, who was born to a father who had no
siblings, and Lazura grew up receiving the full affection of the adults;
she must have been a very happy child.  
Surrounded by love, growing up healthy, the house was filled with
happiness in those days.  
  
When Lazura was six, her stepmother finally conceived a child, and thus
her younger sister, Bery, was born.  
However, the reason everyone was not overjoyed was because Bery fell ill
immediately after birth and hovered between life and death.  
Even after overcoming that, she repeatedly fell ill, and a doctor
visited at least once a month. Her stepmother, who was originally frail,
also fell ill after childbirth and passed away within three years.  
Lazura was rarely allowed to see her sister's face, for fear of bringing
in something harmful from outside.  
Because her lessons began around that time, she had only a handful of
memories of spending time with her sister for a while after her birth.  
  
Lazura seemed to be a very energetic girl, but her sister was the
complete opposite.  
From childhood, she was taciturn, rarely spoke, and always had an
expressionless or stern face.  
She never showed a childish smile, and always spent the entire day
gazing out the window.  
  
Whenever Lazura asked about her health, Bery always replied, "I'm
fine."  
Even when she clearly looked unwell, it was always just that one phrase:
"I'm fine."  
Perhaps even from the age of two or three, she already understood her
situation to some extent.  
She was just pretending to be okay so as not to worry others—just trying
not to show it on her face.  
Her behavior was simply to hide her pain.  
  
The servants were worried that Bery might be a little strange, but
Lazura didn't think so.  
She had spent most of her life in bed since birth, suffering from
illness, and had been told that her mother had died while she was
confined to bed.  
If she had spent every day smiling after all that, that would have been
unnatural.  
  
Even when Lazura realized that her sister was incomparably smarter than
herself, she didn't feel envious or jealous. That was because she had
seen Bery and the looks of those around her.  
Being intelligent was, in a sense, a very pitiful thing.  
At an age when Lazura would have been innocently carefree, Bery couldn't
simply enjoy it. She had to be considerate, and then, to make matters
worse, she was treated as eerie for not being childlike.  
  
After seeing her sister smile, Lazura began to visit her room frequently
and talk about various things.  
Her sister's environment wasn't good.  
It was probably because she felt she had to change it, acting like an
older sister.  
  
"...As Nee-sama said, I tried to talk to others, but I didn't know what
to talk about. They always clean my room, so I thought that would be a
good topic... I always felt there was a lot of waste, so I wondered if
it would finish faster this way."  
"I-I see..."  
"Then, it seems I made Selis angry..."  
  
However, things don't always go smoothly.  
When Lazura suggested that Bery talk to other people more, it went
completely awry.  
It was quite a task, as Bery even began instructing a fairly veteran
servant on her work.  
  
Selis, who was originally a difficult servant, became furious.  
She fumed that it was too insulting, even from a young mistress, and
demanded a change of duties.  
Bery's words were probably not wrong, but most people would surely be
annoyed if a five-year-old criticized their work.  
It would be cruel to simply blame Selis.  
  
"Did I say something to make her angry?"  
"It's not quite like that... What should I say? Maybe it's about how you
said it."  
"How I said it..."  
"Yes. While it's true that Selis and the others might have been
inefficient in their methods, do you understand that they were also
working hard, trying their best to make sure you were as comfortable as
possible in your room?"  
"Um... yes."  
  
Bery nodded on the bed, tilting her head slightly.  
  
"In response to that, if Bery tells them, 'Your work is inefficient,' I
think they'd still get a little upset. Selis and the others might have
been inefficient, but they might have been working hard for Bery's
sake..."  
"...I see...?"  
"When you say something, you really have to consider the other person's
feelings before you speak."  
  
Lazura sat beside her and traced her index finger along Bery's pink
lips.  
The sensation was incredibly soft; everything was smooth like
porcelain.  
  
"I did say you should talk to people, but don't rush. When you want to
say something with that adorable mouth of yours, think about how the
other person will receive your words. Bery, you can do it properly."  
"...It's difficult."  
"It's okay, you're very clever. ...This is a good luck charm, from your
Nee-sama."  
"A charm..."  
  
As Lazura gently traced them, Bery's eyes softened ticklishly, and she
looked up at Lazura with large eyes.  
She was a child as beautiful as a doll.  
Perhaps her unchildlike, inorganic expression made others feel uneasy.  
*If only she would smile, she's so adorable*, Lazura thought.  
  
"That's right. So Bery can get along with others... Fufu, I'm putting a
wish like that into it. You're so cute, after all, I want that cuteness
to reach others too."  
"Huh..."  
  
Bery tilted her head, tracing her lips, and Lazura smiled wryly,
wondering if she had made it a bit too difficult.  
  
"It's really just a small thing. Selis might not have gotten angry if
you'd just said it differently... For example, did you ever say thank
you for always cleaning your room?"  
"...I didn't."  
"That's it. Do you greet them properly?"  
"...I don't."  
"It's fine to start with those small things. Like 'Good morning,' or
'It's a nice day.'"  
  
Lazura stroked her head, and Bery tilted her head in a troubled manner,
then cast her eyes down.  
When asked if something was wrong, Bery looked at Lazura—and pondered,
tracing her lips with her fingertip.  
  
"Um..."  
"What?"  
"Well, unlike Nee-sama, everyone always seems busy... I thought talking
about nothing would be a bother."  
"...Oh, actually..."  
  
Hearing that, Lazura rubbed her temples.  
It seemed her sister somehow saw Lazura as a very frivolous person.  
  
"Even though I look like this, I'm quite busy. I have many lessons, and
I come to see Bery by weaving through that difficult schedule."  
"...? Why?"  
  
Bery asked, puzzled.  
She must have been asking from the bottom of her heart.  
Even things that would ordinarily not be questioned.  
  
"If you're busy, you don't have to force yourself to come. I'm fine, and
I don't want to trouble Nee-sama—"  
"You're not a bother. Your Nee-sama comes to see her cute little sister
because she wants to relax while doting on her."  
"Relax..."  
"That's right. An older sister dotes on her younger sister and
one-sidedly enjoys herself by grandly teaching her all sorts of things.
You don't have to hold back, and since I want to come, you mustn't ask
'why.' Understood?"  
  
Lazura leaned in and told her, and Bery nodded with a puzzled look,
saying "Yes."
