## Chapter 357: The Mad Rabbit's Twirl-Slash – End

"—I will avenge them!"  
  
That was the squad leader's shout, and we charged forward, despite our
fear.  
The silver-haired headhunter continued to massacre.  
A monster beyond human comprehension, casually slaughtering those who
approached—it was a concept more than a being.  
  
It was death, in the form of a girl.  
  
Was there ever a moment so long, as we watched our comrades fall one
after another?  
He ran, sword in hand, watching the girl surrounded, unilaterally
killing.  
A scene that defied reality.  
It felt like a dream. His legs were heavy, as if running through water;
the wind clung to him.  
  
When the girl glanced their way, the first blood blossomed from the
squad leader.  
She must have stepped forward and slit his throat.  
But it was as if the wind had simply passed through—we couldn't even
react.  
Seeing the blood gush forth, he realized it was her doing and looked
behind him, but there was no one there.  
  
Then, he caught a glimpse of more blood spraying next to him; looking
over, he saw more beside that.  
  
"Taruta!"  
  
A voice echoed, and there was a shock.  
Only after he hit the ground did he realize he had been kicked by the
man he considered a brother.  
When he looked up, he saw him spraying blood…and then he realized that
all his squadmates were dead.  
  
Before he could even try to stand, their eyes met.  
Ice purple eyes.  
Krische Christand stood there, like a silhouette in the night.  
Before anger, before hatred, fear consumed him, and he dropped the sword
in his right hand.  
  
As if begging for mercy.  
It was a long time—as if the world had stopped.  
  
"Bald Eagle, burn the fort."  
"Yes!"  
  
The moment her gaze left him, he felt relief.  
More than the loss of my family, more than anything else—at that moment,
Taruta felt relieved that his life had been spared. 
<br /><br />

  
Eight survived.  
Most were killed or suffered injuries so severe they could not return to
duty.  
Ashamed of himself, Taruta was met with kindness from the other
survivors.  
General Wiring even praised them as brave warriors who fought until
their unit was annihilated in the face of a surprise attack.  
  
The army was thrown into chaos by the death of the commander and
Adjutant.  
Most of the nearly two thousand people present fled.  
They likely did so to maintain the army's image.  
  
Taruta, who could do nothing, was promoted to corporal.  
Afterward, the nightmarish massacres by Krische Christand and the Black
Century continued. Many soldiers went mad, refusing to climb Bernaich.  
Untouched, Taruta volunteered for exploration.  
Deemed a brave man, he was made a sergeant.  
It was a self-destructive act born of shame at his cowardice and a
half-hearted desire for death. He wasn't brave.  
A coward who failed to protect his family, driven to despair, simply
pushed himself.  
He never encountered Krische again there, remaining a coward who
survived, eventually becoming a centurion.  
  
It was good luck, if you want to call it that.  
Being lauded as a brave man despite doing nothing—if that's luck, then
so be it.  
The truly brave died, and the coward took their place.  
After that, he decided to live to die—to atone for himself, who clung to
life, unable to protect his family and his mother.  
  
The civil war ended, and the Five Great Nations War began.  
Death remained distant, and as he aged, he trained himself to overcome
his regrets.  
Those around him saw him as a model soldier—a veteran who survived a
confrontation with Alberinea during the civil war.  
While Krische Christand's name echoed in the heavens as a hero's, the
coward's shame was transformed into a tale of valor—denying it would be
seen as humility; what greater humiliation could there be?  
  
He was not a man worthy of respect.  
He was a despicable man deserving of contempt.  
He simply wanted to end his life and atone for that day.  
  
Then began the Elsren Liberation War, now known as the Dismantling War—a
great war against the great nation of Elsren.  
After winning the first battle decisively, Taruta, now a major, was
tasked with stabilizing and securing the surrounding areas.  
  
Elsren was vast.  
There were many villages, and no small number of Elsren remnants would
be hiding there.  
A few hiding here and there wouldn't be a problem, but a gathering of
them would become bandits.  
Preventing that was Taruta's duty.  
  
His mistake came then.  
  
An unprecedented large-scale invasion.  
Many of the mobilized soldiers were new recruits, and he knew that many
were no better than bandits.  
Any unit with such concerns should have been accompanied by him, or been
deployed with another Century.  
  
But Taruta sought only a place to die on the front lines.  
He wanted to finish this quickly and join the front lines.  
He couldn't deny that this thought influenced his actions.  
  
"Therefore, I will temporarily divide the battalion, and each village
will be inspected by a Century. As you all know, this war is not a war
of aggression but aims to liberate Elsren from oppression. Violence
against civilians is strictly prohibited. Plunder by soldiers will be
considered collective responsibility, and you will also be punished.
Understand that the death penalty may be applied in certain cases."  
"Yes!"  
  
He told this to the centurions in the tent.  
The two Centuries were a concern.  
Both were full of new recruits, and both had their captains either
killed or wounded.  
One had its sergeant promoted, while the other was newly transferred
from another army corps.  
  
"Albess, Rins, your Centuries have many new recruits. It will be
difficult to control them. Given the nature of the mission, I will
accompany one. Considering the worst-case scenario, I believe it would
be appropriate for the other to accompany another Century—"  
"Yes. We appreciate your consideration. However, with all due respect,
considering the layout of nearby villages, combining units would delay
regrouping."  
  
The one who spoke was Zanubar Rins.  
A young man in his mid-twenties, of noble birth.  
While he seemed confident as he pointed to the map, he too was eager for
glory.  
  
"Although we won a great victory in the first battle thanks to
Alberinea's efforts and her magical weapons, Elsren is a great power.
The outcome of the war will depend on our success in expanding the
battlefront. Although it's only a day or two, this delay shouldn't be
overlooked."  
  
He had a point.  
In the end, it was a decisive victory—a literal dismantling war.  
Elsren was dismantled, helpless against Alberinea’s exploits and her
magical weapons.  
However, many soldiers were not so optimistic at the time.  
A superpower that had dominated the central continent for two hundred
years since its division, battles against it had always been a
back-and-forth affair.  
  
Alberinea, who single-handedly repelled a three-nation invasion and
overwhelmed Elsren in the first battle.  
Taruta had also witnessed Krische Christand in the mountains.  
Even Taruta wasn't optimistic about the Elsren invasion.  
  
"Regarding my unit, there are no problems controlling the soldiers.
They're a bit uncouth, but their rebellious attitude has subsided, and
their cohesion is strong. I understand your concerns, but please leave
it to me."  
  
While there was a slight air of overconfidence, it was natural for his
age.  
Perhaps he saw himself in the desperate efforts of those around him, a
reflection of his past self.  
  
"Understood. Albess, I will accompany your unit."  
"Yes!"  
"Including Rins and the others, once again instruct your soldiers about
what will happen next. …Now we will decide on the route assignments."  
  
—It was his worst mistake.  
Why did he think that someone he saw himself in would be able to wield a
sword when the time came?  
  
It was only strong words to cover up his weakness.  
HE didn't want to admit to the fact that he was laughed at by his unit
for being a nobleman's son. He simply didn't have the strength to accept
his weakness.  
  
Taruta heard the details later.  
There was a small, uncharted village. Initially, there was a minor
conflict there, and a soldier killed someone.  
Zanubar tried to stop him, but it escalated to two, then three.  
  
*'Captain, either way, if it gets out, it'll be bad. It's a village not
on the map; it's better to pretend it never existed. If there are no
witnesses, they won't know we did it; if we pretend it's bandits and
look the other way...'*  
  
Instead of drawing his sword to protect the villagers, Zanubar listened
to this deceitful proposal.  
He said he had no allies, that he was afraid of being killed, that he
was afraid of damaging his reputation.  
  
As a result, thirty-four villagers were raped and murdered.  
  
A passing messenger noticed and reported it to Alberinea, who was
slightly ahead.  
Upon regrouping, they were taken to the tent and told what had
happened.  
  
"Surely you received Selene's orders. Instead of protecting the
civilians, you committed a massacre. This can be seen as a malicious act
of rebellion."  
  
Krische Christand addressed Taruta, who was kneeling.  
  
"...It also damaged the army's cause. This time, as a bonus, we'll give
everyone a limb-by-limb dismemberment. Any objections?"  
"...None."  
"Your responsibility as their superior officer is heavy. I'm considering
stripping you of your military rank and title and executing you, but you
are allowed to offer a defense. Do you have anything to say?"  
  
It was only natural.  
Because he wasted a day or two, a village was destroyed.  
Innocent people were killed by those who were no better than bandits.  
  
What he did was no different from what the thugs who attacked his
hometown did.  
Taruta joined the army hoping to prevent such tragedies from ever
happening again, but he forgot his initial resolve, and while clinging
to his cowardly life, he ended up destroying a village.  
Even death would be too lenient.  
  
"May I request one thing?"  
"What is it?"  
"Instead of death, please dismember me as well. I would like to serve as
a warning, so that this never happens again."  
  
"Haa…to willingly undergo such pain is peculiar. Krische has no
objection, but..."  
"I'm a survivor of death…you spared me at Bernaich…"  
"…? Your face…"  
  
Looking up, the girl frowned in thought, then clapped her hands.  
  
"Ah, the person at the fort. Krische remembers now."  
  
A soldier from decades ago—she laughed at his face.  
She had various anecdotes, but as she was known for never forgetting a
face once seen. The memory of that coward's face remained.  
  
"At that time…I feared for my life, not to avenge my comrades. This is
the result…It is a fitting punishment for me, to be dismembered
alongside them."  
"Krische thinks it's not a good idea to throw away your life senselessly
in that situation…but that's a good attitude. Krische’ll consider it."  
"Thank you…"  
  
However, his wish was not granted.  
His subordinates and other major captains pleaded for his life.  
  
Krische addressed Taruta, who lamented that he was not even allowed to
die.  
  
"From what others have told Krische, you seem to be respected as a
major, and your execution would be more detrimental than exemplary.
Therefore, the execution is cancelled."  
"But—"  
"Besides, Krische was once told…it's important to sincerely reflect on
what you've done and think seriously about it."  
  
She nodded.  
  
"Krische doesn't think you lack remorse, considering you requested to be
dismembered. To make sure it never happens again, think seriously about
it…that's what Krische thinks, and the person who told Krische that
would probably say the same to you."  
"However…"  
"If you feel the punishment is insufficient, punish yourself. Make up
for it by doing a lot of good things. But it's not something Krische or
anyone else should tell you. That's about it, isn't it?"  
  
She looked at Taruta, who shook his head, with kindness.  
  
"Many people say they respect you deeply…Krische thinks the most
important thing is to never betray those who believe in you."  
  
She narrowed her eyes, as if reminiscing about something.  
  
"Krische doesn't understand what is good or bad…but Krische thinks that
much is definitely not wrong." 
<br /><br />

  
"…Sarani's mother is a survivor of that village. Apparently, she was
hidden by her parents and held her breath. She was found later when
people went to bury the villagers and was taken in as a foster child
after the war."  
  
It was quite different from what Boji heard at the dojo.  
But that's how it was.  
From the perspective of those who witnessed it, it was just the story of
a bunch of thugs who were executed, and a major who was almost caught up
in it.  
From one perspective, that was the truth, and nothing more.  
Considering the various tragedies that occur in a world of war, it was a
small matter. But for those involved, it was a different story.  
  
A small world within a large world, a world inaccessible to others.  
He was telling Boji this because he had accepted him into that world.  
  
"I was thinking of ending my life…but Alberinea's words came to mind.
Death is not atonement. I wish she had hated me…She was kind, just like
Sarani…What about that child's parents?"  
"…They died from an epidemic while traveling with her father."  
"…That village was apparently his hometown."  
  
The old soldier nodded.  
His father was a traveling merchant, and after they married, they
traveled together.  
The couple were kind and, knowing there was an illness in the village,
went to deliver medicine.  
  
"Sarani's father was also a good man. He couldn't use a sword, but he
was true to his beliefs. He also had knowledge of medicine, and he
wouldn't listen to my words, saying that if he didn't go, who would
help. His daughter also accompanied her husband…Thanks to their efforts,
the village was saved, but they both succumbed to the illness and never
returned."  
  
He quietly said that only the brave die.  
  
"I, a coward, couldn't even protect what was precious to me. I couldn't
even die, and I've continued to live unscathed after committing a
crime…It's pathetic."  
  
Looking up at the ceiling, he looked back at Boji.  
  
"But Sarani's parents entrusted Sarani to me. I wanted to protect her
happy future. The only thing I can do is to find someone worthy of
her."  
  
Boji straightened his back and looked at him straight in the eye.  
  
"I want you to swear on your name…that you will protect her happiness,
in my stead."  
  
Boji tried to answer immediately, but he couldn't.  
After hearing that story, could he really say something like that?  
It would be flimsy.  
  
"With all due respect, I am immature."  
  
Boji honestly told Taruta.  
  
"My swordsmanship is a crude imitation, and my love for Sarani is
genuine, but it is no match for yours, having watched over her since
infancy… I alone cannot offer you a certain pledge."  
  
He bowed deeply.  
  
"Baron Baulzon. If I, in my immaturity, am to make such a pledge, I need
someone like you, who will correct, admonish, and watch over me, a
novice… If you would agree to this…"  
  
—I swear on this name, without a doubt.  
There was a pause.  
  
"You cannot swear on your name alone?"  
  
"I am the son of a baker from the common folk. Unlike you, I've lived
without suffering hardships and have been protected. For me to speak
empty words would be meaningless."  
  
Looking up, Boji smiled.  
  
"Besides, this is something I learned at the dojo…never engage in a
battle alone; rely on those who can help you to win. When I was a child,
I listened to heroic tales, I thought it was cowardly, but as an adult,
once I knew my limits, it sounded like good advice.…Your efforts alone
are limited."  
  
After hearing his words…Taruta nodded softly.  
  
"So that's it, that's right. You're right. That's the principle of a
soldier. No matter how much you despise yourself, you can't become
someone else…If you do your best, it is natural to rely on others."  
  
And he nodded deeply.  
  
“……Confined to myself for decades, looking back, my mistake may have
been forgetting such a fundamental principle above all else. Which of us
is the half-baked one?”  
  
He chuckled with a distant look in his eyes, shaking his head.  
  
“It may be a pathetic vow, but is it alright?”  
“……Sufficient. If this old body can do anything, rely on me anytime.
Half-baked together… or perhaps that’s how we finally become whole.”  
“Perhaps so, on my part.”  
  
He laughed, and Taruta laughed too, their laughter filling the room for
a while. 
<br /><br />

  
From then on, the atmosphere was amicable.  
“I had heard some from Sarani, but I wanted to hear your story again,”
he said, referring to Boji.  
Taruta, being a seasoned soldier, was apparently quite interested in how
a baker in the city spent his days.  
He curiously inquired about the preparation and procurement processes,
and before long, Sarani returned.  
  
During the meal, they discussed the future.  
He, the Baron, mentioned wanting to greet his parents.  
Boji offered to bring the two of them, but he shook her head, saying it
was because she he was entrusting Sarani to them.  
A meeting with his parents was scheduled for the end of the month—and
the next day, they reported to the dojo.  
  
Sarani also accompanied them to offer her thanks.  
  
“I-I’m so pleased to finally meet you, Alberinea…”  
  
Just then—presumably to check on Boji's progress—Alberinea was visiting,
wearing an apron dress.  
Although he had mentioned that she was like that, Sarani was still a
noble’s daughter.  
She hadn't expected Princess Alberinea to be piggybacked by a child and,
without realizing it, stared intently, which resulted in her prostrating
in fear that she had been disrespectful.  
  
“Um, nice to meet you… You don’t have to prostrate yourself. For Krische
this is an informal visit.”  
“Y-Yes…”  
  
Sarani, lifting her face, was pale.  
Boji chuckled, reassured her, and took her arm.  
  
He sometimes wondered if it was really alright, but he ahd never heard
of Alberinea reprimanding someone for being disrespectful.  
Normally, even if you just saw her walking down the street, subordinates
would stop and bow their heads, and it would be considered an honor just
to see her face.  
Yet, customers would casually greet her.  
Even guards and nobles who should reprimand them would turn a blind eye
in such situations.  
Alberinea was treated as such a person.  
  
“Thanks to you, we've become engaged. I am Sarani.”  
“Ehehe, that’s wonderful. Did you manage to do a proper kurukuru?”  
“To some extent… due to the difference in skill, I couldn't win.
However, he acknowledged me.”  
“Boji is a good boy, so Krische wasn't really worried…”  
  
“You’re amazing,” she said, stroking Boji’s head while still
piggybacking the child.  
The child on her back also patted Boji’s head, saying, “Amazing,
amazing.”  
  
“Don’t you touch him too, Ronda. And how long are you going to have
Alberinea give you a piggyback ride?”  
“Get off!”  
  
She lifted the child and set him down, and finally, a smile returned to
Sarani’ face.  
Then, they greeted Mia, Kalua, and the other instructors.  
Sarani had heard the circumstances from Taruta and his mother, so she
was a little nervous, but Alberinea and the other members were the
same.  
The Black Flag Special Unit were a unit whose name came up first when
talking about heroes, but everyone was easygoing and relaxed.  
This was probably due to the fact that they were originally all
commoners.  
  
*‘I’m not a soldier anymore, and I’m not a noble by birth either. I’m
originally a country girl from the countryside, and it’s hard to be
stiff and formal. Everyone here is similar, so it's actually just right
to be natural. It's just that the unsuitable has returned to its
original form.’*  
  
Mia, the head instructor, was the prime example.  
She was the former captain of the Black Flag Special Unit, still
respected by the soldiers, and her background was incredible when you
think about it.  
However, she was incredibly easygoing and humble in appearance.  
When Boji suggested that she adopt a more appropriate attitude...  
  
*‘I think Krische-sama is the same, you know,’ * she said with a wry
smile.  
  
He had heard that she had grown up in a rural village.  
Her easygoing atmosphere probably stemmed from that.  
She didn't seem to mind taking care of children, just as she appeared.  
Among the children, she had the air of an onee-san.  
Perhaps, as Mia said, that's her true self.  
  
Sarani bombarded Kalua and the others with questions.  
Alberinea looked happy sitting on Mia’s lap.  
  
“Hmm, I wish Mia had a bit bigger chest. Krische think the cushioning
would be better for her back”  
“C-Cushioning…”  
  
Mia and Krische were talking about such things.  
Boji chuckled and recalled his conversation with Taruta on the way
home.  
  
*‘See you again… I'll hone that sword for the next time we spar.’*  
*‘…Hone, huh?’*  
*‘…?’*  
  
Taruta shook his head.  
  
*‘The sword you wielded, Alberinea’s sword… it was indeed a wonderful
sword. Honing it as a technique is good. However, it is not necessarily
good to perfect it.’*  
*‘What do you mean…?’*  
*‘Footwork and construction… to perfect what lies beyond that, it would
be the mindset. To wield a fatal blow, one needs a fatal mindset. For
that to become a true fatal blow, one must abandon, discard emotion, and
only then can the wielder reach that state… It is not a sword that those
who live in the city should aim for.’*  
  
He said that, gazing at the sword hanging on the wall.  
  
*‘It’s a time to adorn swords. I think it's enough for those like you to
understand a part of that. Hone it as a skill, and possess it without
wielding it.’*  
*‘To possess it without wielding it…’*  
*‘Yes. A sword to be strong… I think the sword you wield should perfect
for that kind. You don’t need to be able to dance freely like
Alberinea.’*  
  
—He added that she ended that era.  
  
Boji closed his eyes slightly, then turned to Alberinea.  
  
“……Alberinea, may I ask you a question?”  
“What is it?”  
“What… is a sword?”  
  
He asked unexpectedly, and Alberinea tilted her head.  
  
“Um… if you ask what a sword is, it’s a sword…?”  
“Krische, I don’t think that’s what he means… Boji, if you’re going to
ask a question, do it in a way Krische can understand. She can’t
understand vague phrasing.”  
“……Mia, are you calling Krische stupid?”  
“I-I’m not… uuu!”  
  
Watching the girl pull Mia’s cheek in displeasure, he shook his head,
admitting he was wrong.  
To begin with, why did he want to ask her?  
  
“U-Um, well… how should we use the sword we learned here?”  
  
He asked again, slightly regretting it. She traced her lips with her
fingertip, lost in thought.  
It was Alberinea's habit when she was deep in thought.  
  
“You don’t have to use it, do you? There’s no need to use it.”  
  
“It’s a sword for just in case,” she continued.  
  
“If you can avoid using it, that's the best. Krische happened to be good
at it and it proved useful, but it’s much better if a sword is
useless.”  
“Useless…”  
“Yes. That’s why the continent was unified.”  
  
The literally unparalleled sword god smiled.  
  
“Because Krische once wished Krische’s sword would become useless.”  
  
Alberinea, who had cut down all sorts of swordsmen and heroes, had
etched a name that would remain forever in history.  
She was probably the greatest hero in this world who had killed more
people than anyone else.  
  
Boji smiled at the sight of her smiling in her apron dress.  
  
“So, a sword is a hobby?”  
“Krische thinks so now. It’s a hobby because it’s peaceful.”  
  
He closed his eyes, understanding.  
Taruta’s words—the useless heavenly sword—were probably just that.  
  
“……Then, as a hobby, I will continue to learn it moderately.”  
“Yes, do your best moderately.”  
  
He bowed his head, and she nodded happily.  
  
“Baking delicious bread isn’t a hobby you can do moderately, you
know.”  
  
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Boji said, and she patted his head,
giggling.  
  
If there was an ultimate goal to strive for in swordsmanship, it would
surely be her.  
But in the hands of her who had reached the pinnacle, there was no
longer a sword.  
Only a gentle, soft hand stroking a child's head with a smile.  
  
—Right, a sword is fine as a hobby.  
  
Boji laughed quietly and nodded.
