## Chapter 362: Far, Far in the Future – The End

"This victory is truly thanks to your efforts, the Red Goddesses. The
dominion of those cruel sorcerers ends now... it's the dawn of a new
era. Captain Elaine, name your wish. You are a hero."  
  
Victory over the evil Great Empire of Kleinmere, which had dominated the
world for a thousand years.  
A dazzling banquet was held in its imperial capital, Albeneria, to
celebrate the triumph.  
The captain of the *Red Goddesses*, a beautiful woman in military
uniform with her red hair tied up―Elaine―had also been invited.  
  
"Swift restoration of public order, please. ...The indiscriminate witch
hunts happening in various places are nothing but massacres. What
justice do we, who wield righteous indignation to oppress the weak,
truly possess?"  
  
To the jubilant powerful, a cold splash of water, much to their
chagrin.  
The air fell silent, and it felt surprisingly pleasant.  
  
She didn't think her words would change anything.  
A mere girl with no political power, her cries meant nothing, just a
childish outburst of frustration.  
  
She left the banquet with a perfunctory apology, saying she seemed
tired.  
Her steps led her to Jarea-Gashea's storage.  
  
"Captain..."  
"It was a pointless banquet. ...Leave me alone for a while."  
"...Yes."  
  
She spoke to one of the squad members present and walked towards one of
the units.  
A giant steel soldier lay on a platform.  
Its head, shaped like large eyes, had horn decorations painted red.  
The first unit captured by the Allied Forces—the original, known as Red
Horn.  
Secured by a separate detachment along with a transmitter, it then
fought until the end of the war as Jarea-Gashea, operated by Elicia and
her comrades, without significant damage.  
  
The Red Horn would preempt their retreat routes, or kill their
commanders, allowing Elicia's unit to capture other Jarea-Gashea.  
Their basic policy remained unchanged from beginning to end: after their
existence became known to the enemy and they became targets, the Red
Horn acted as their escort.  
The Red Goddesses never suffered a single casualty until the very end.  
The Red Horn alone slaughtered everything that opposed red hair.  
  
A mad monster that avoided magic projectiles faster than sound and
killed dozens of people in the blink of an eye.  
She heard that long ago, some people would face such monsters with just
a sword or spear, but if such people existed, they couldn't have been
human.  
If it hadn't had a fatal weakness, the empire would have continued for
another thousand years.  
  
Opening the head armor, she took out the core inside.  
Countless engravings danced wildly within.  
Alberinea's magic crystal, incomprehensible to anyone in this world.  
  
She sat on the platform, squinting as she held it up.  
  
"You're beautiful."  
  
It was so beautiful, one would not believe it was created to kill
people.  
Blue engravings shimmered and appeared within the gem, arcing and
bursting forth, as if alive.  
It was something more befitting display as an art piece than being on a
battlefield.  
  
Due to Kleinmere's tyranny, her younger brother starved to death.  
Elaine's country was subservient to them, but she was convinced that,
like other nations, it would eventually revolt. For revenge, she joined
the army at fifteen.  
  
It was easy and good to resent something.  
What Elaine saw at the time was the evil Kleinmere and the righteous
Allied Forces opposing it—a simple worldview polarized into good and
evil.  
There could be no greater happiness than believing they were on the side
of justice.  
  
Indeed, Kleinmere acted cruelly.  
The use of destructive weapons involving civilians, massacres, and the
wrongful execution of prisoners.  
After alienating most nations, the Holy Spirit Covenant became a mere
formality, and they stopped caring about appearances.  
People in other countries all hated them, and their leaders fanned the
hatred, sending people to the battlefield.  
By the time Elaine joined the war, the continent was filled with hatred
and fear.  
  
Her sense of justice wavered when an enemy squad, called upon to
surrender, committed mass suicide.  
By then, lynching of prisoners by Allied forces was occurring
everywhere, and they must have feared being tortured to death.  
She clearly remembered their faces, filled with terror, as they exploded
before her eyes.  
  
*"If you're captured by the Alliance, you'll be tortured to death."*  
*"If you're a sorcerer, your end will be even more tragic."*  
  
She learned then that this was what they were taught among themselves.  
Ah, they were human too, she remembered the obvious.  
  
Not everyone would have agreed with the country's policies.  
They were just born and raised there.  
And once a battle began, sometimes one had to fight for what was
precious.  
  
Kleinmere gained an advantage with the existence of magic weapons, but
compared to the Alliance, they were overwhelmingly inferior in terms of
population and lacked leeway.  
Many were forced to fight.  
  
On their side, fighting under the guise of justice, and on the other,
fighting spurred by fear.  
What would happen if their homeland, which had dominated and oppressed
many, hated by many, were to fall?  
They all sensed it—and indeed, it came to pass.  
  
"We are different. You are not pure like us."  
  
She decided to fight for her subordinates, while attempting to avert her
eyes.  
They were merely fighting to protect what was precious to each other.  
It was sufficient as a substitute for the pretense of justice, and over
several years of fighting, she was promoted repeatedly, gaining 300
subordinates.  
Just as they were all talking about seeing the dawn together, a single
original appeared.  
The Red Horn Jarea-Gashea.  
  
She had heard rumors. That it was a point of no return.  
She hadn't meant to underestimate it, nor had she been careless, but she
learned the meaning of those words only after losing everything she was
supposed to protect.  
  
Kleinmere's frontal combat capability was overwhelming.  
Superior firepower from magical weapons, iron soldiers who feared no
death—the Alliance, despite always having a numerical advantage of
several times, saw many lives melt away like butter dropped on a hot
plate.  
  
A magical empire that lasted a thousand years—the age of war was long
past.  
The Alliance, which had been optimistic that numbers would prevail, was
troubled by a major defeat in the initial battle and looked to the
past.  
They changed their strategy itself. Proposed by Eluga Faren, who had
also fought on the battlefield with Alberinea a thousand years ago, they
based it on skirmish tactics and raid warfare by small groups.  
They leveraged their numerical advantage, infiltrating and disrupting
behind enemy lines, based on the premise of sacrifices.  
Kleinmere was forced to retreat in the face of this fighting style that
thoroughly avoided frontal combat, but what raged there was original
Jarea-Gashea.  
An insane killing machine created by Alberinea herself.  
  
It was by no means an invincible weapon.  
There were records of its destruction, based on the premise of
concentrated firepower.  
However, for small groups that relinquished the firepower necessary for
that premise, it was a monster they couldn't handle.  
  
She had been told of its terror often enough and had undergone
appropriate training.  
She had considered what to do if they encountered it, devised tactics
assuming casualties, and repeatedly told her subordinates that focused
firepower using a desperate decoy was indispensable.  
No matter how powerful, it was ultimately a machine.  
If it only killed people indiscriminately, they could manage as long as
someone sacrificed themselves.  
All her subordinates were excellent soldiers ready to make that
sacrifice, and being their captain was Elaine's pride.  
However, as a result—all of Elaine's proud subordinates were killed
without exception.  
  
The raid was at night, during encampment.  
Jarea-Gashea was unfazed by the darkness of night.  
The moment the attack was heard, magic lamps for illumination were
scattered around to secure visibility.  
  
Instead of betting on the luck of not encountering it, they were poised
to hunt it.  
They were as prepared as possible, and considering the training level of
the soldiers, it was probably the best situation for encountering the
Original.  
She believed that if they coordinated, they could definitely defeat it,
but there was one miscalculation.  
Alberinea's Original was not such a cute weapon that simply massacred
enemies indiscriminately.  
  
Those who commanded loudly were killed first.  
It avoided inducements and encirclements, disrupting with its
overwhelming mobility.  
Despite its overwhelming combat power, it did not act overconfidently.
It broke lights, hid among trees, lurked in bushes, and even induced
friendly fire among the elites.  
  
By the time the troops were consolidated in an open area, more than half
of her subordinates had already been lost.  
It was then that the Red Horn, bathed in the blood of her subordinates,
appeared before Elaine.  
It held a thick, board-like sword in its right arm and a magic
projectile launcher in its left.  
Blue light flickered inside its eye-like visor.  
Under the moonlight—the giant simply continued to kill the gathered
subordinates.  
Elaine and her subordinates resisted desperately, but it was a one-sided
slaughter.  
  
Among the corpses of her subordinates, only Elaine remained alive.  
As she lay there, unable to stand, she screamed, "Why won't you kill
me?", but it ignored her, as if to say its job was done, and turned on
its heel.  
  
—She wished the thing standing before her eyes was just a weapon.  
For example, if she could just believe it was a killing machine created
by the abnormal Alberinea, an evil entity created only to kill people,
she would have been happy.  
  
But that was not the case.  
This, too, like Elaine and her subordinates, was created to protect
something precious. An unshakable love for one servant was sealed within
it.  
The beauty residing in this engraving must be Alberinea's love.  
  
"...Not pure, like you."  
  
At some point, people just became twisted.  
Alberinea brought peace to the continent, and Elgainst Ramil, who
inherited her legacy, built a peace that lasted a thousand years in this
world.  
  
The beginning, surely, from the gentlest of wishes.  
Everyone just forgot it.  
They just couldn't make this beautiful magic crystal into an ornament.  
  
It killed all of Elaine's subordinates and protected all of its own.  
It ended a foolish war.  
But people, unchastened, oppressed new weaklings.  
Thus, the human world would repeat itself.  
Forgetting the thousand-year gentle prayer preserved in this magic
crystal.  
  
"...Even so, I haven't given up. I believe people will someday learn
from their repeated foolishness and change. I'm not the only one who
wishes for this, and a hundred years from now, a thousand years from
now... or perhaps tens of thousands of years from now, such an era will
surely come."  
  
Elaine smiled quietly.  
  
"Meager though my power may be, I do not wish for a life spent rotting
away in lament. ...I will ask for you as my reward. Watch over me and
bear witness."  
  
Then she closed her eyes and pressed the core against her forehead.  
  
"So that my words do not become a lie."  
  
—*Such is my prayer*, she finished silently.  
Some time passed. She slowly opened her eyes and gently stroked the
magic crystal.  
  
"Sleep now, Red Horn. ...And may you awaken someday."  
  
As if to carve the beauty of the gem into her eyes and memory.  
  
"In a world worthy of you, filled with gentle prayers." 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
Some time later, two women came to visit her.  
  
"...Sena-san."  
"...Is something wrong?"  
"No, it's very Sena-san-like, but..."  
  
Salia, with more wrinkles and streaks of white hair, shook her head in
exasperation and sighed.  
Mili next to her was also speechless, completely dumbfounded.  
  
"I'm sorry. I should have checked properly."  
"N-No, it's not the Professor's fault... I mean, you wouldn't normally
think she's alive..."  
  
Long, long ago—when Alberan existed.  
The stars were enveloped in Alberinea's magic, by something called the
Great Law of Heaven and Earth.  
It was believed to be a myth, but it seemed to be true, and even now,
this planet was enveloped in Alberinea's magic, and there had been
several subtle changes regarding it.  
  
Even in sleep mode, she sensed etheric movements with extremely high
precision.  
It was said to be an advanced magic that even Sena couldn't fully grasp,
but if it changed, she could apparently perceive it. There had been
frequent changes during the Kleinmere era.  
The frequency gradually decreased, but recently, she had observed a
similar change fifty-seven years after the Minalshi's visit.  
  
Only Alberinea herself or Queen Kreschenta of Alberan could interfere
with Alberinea's magic, and she seemed to have judged that some kind of
correction was being made.  
In other words, she believed that Alberinea was living quite normally
somewhere, having surpassed ten thousand years.  
  
"Anyway," Salia grabbed Sena by both shoulders.  
  
"You don't have to think twice about it, I told you about the urban
legend of Alberinea appearing, right Sena-san? That there are such
stories everywhere! ...Why didn't you say anything then?"  
"...? I heard there were such stories, but... the question was, *'If you
could meet Master, what would you want to talk about?'*"  
  
Sena tilted her head curiously.  
  
"I don't recall ever being asked about Master's survival."  
"You're really inflexible, Sena-san..."  
  
She sighed deeply and shook her head.  
  
"When I heard the interpretation of the vanished queen and Alberinea, I
should have pushed for more... I shouldn't have been so weirdly
considerate."  
  
The end of the Queen and Alberinea was largely divided into two
theories.  
One theory was that the sisters killed each other and perished together,
and the other was that they went on a journey somewhere.  
The latter was the mainstream theory, and Sena also held a similar
interpretation.  
  
"I thought, 'I wouldn't want to think my creator sisters killed each
other,' and ended up apologizing for asking such a stupid question...
But now that I think about it, her answer was immediate. It was like,
'Why are you asking such an obvious thing?'"  
"W-Well, well, Salia-chan... I was the one at fault."  
  
Watching the two, Sena elegantly began to drink tea.  
Mili was dumbfounded by her calm demeanor, as if it were someone else's
problem.  
  
"Sena-san is amazing, isn't she?"  
  
Sena tilted her head with a puzzled expression and said, "Thank you."  
She must have thought she was being praised, though she didn't quite
understand why.  
  
A person from ancient times, who ended up disappearing.  
She wasn't a recent enough figure to the extent of saying "if she were
still alive." There was no need to explicitly state that she was dead.  
It was a story from a thousand, no, ten thousand years ago.  
Everyone referred to Alberinea as a historical figure.  
  
Normally, one would notice, but Sena was inflexible.  
She probably didn't question the implicit mention by Dogle and the
others that she was deceased, and just calmly brushed it off.  
The expression "ancient great person" was true, and in the sense that
she had left the public stage, saying "she is no longer here" was also
true.  
  
"...Anyway, Alberinea is still alive, and the urban legends are true.
She's still living somewhere in this world... Is that right?"  
  
Salia sighed as she confirmed, and Sena thought for a moment befoe
nodding.  
  
"That's right... there's no way to verify the truth of those urban
legends, but if they were Master, I have no particular doubts. Regarding
the apron dress they are said to wear, Master highly regards it as a
wonderful outfit."  
  
She indicated her own apron dress and spoke with a hint of
satisfaction.  
  
"Well, if Sena-san says so, I'll believe it... How about you,
Professor?"  
"It's hard to believe right away, though. Living for over ten thousand
years is unimaginable, or rather..."  
"R-Right..."  
  
As Mili agreed, Salia said,  
  
"You might actually get used to it. Looking back, it feels like it went
by in a flash... Even for you, Mili, doesn't a year fly by now? Even
though it felt so long when you were a child."  
"Well, even if that's the case..."  
"Besides, there's a living example right here... How about you,
Sena-san? How did you feel about the decades since you met the
Professor?"  
  
Sena frowned when asked and replied,  
  
"If you ask how I felt... I felt it as sixty-two years."  
"See? That's what I mean."  
  
Salia gave a wry smile.  
  
"The urban legends about Alberinea... there are many stories about her
camping on mountain peaks, camping on rafts in the open sea, camping on
deserted islands, camping deep in forests... If they're true, I bet she
doesn't even care that much, probably."  
  
Alberinea's urban legends—mysertious stories about a strange guest in an
apron dress.  
Generally, two to seven people, mostly a group of only women in
old-fashioned attire wearing apron dresses, sometimes accompanied by a
giant tiger, a Suiko, that had undergone etheric mutation.  
Despite being an overtly unnatural group, no one questioned them.  
Later, when the shop owner recalled them as strange customers and
checked surveillance cameras, for some reason, no records remained.  
  
Going back, similar stories existed in ancient times—from the Kleinmere
era—about mysterious guests or what seemed like traveling musical
troupes, varying widely over long periods.  
  
The most common stories were probably those where they were rescued by
her in extreme conditions.  
About a thousand years ago, there was also a story about the crew of a
spaceship that malfunctioned and drifted, encountering a mysterious
spaceship (which apparently looked like it couldn't perform space
travel).  
The person themself described it as a hallucination in an extreme state,
but a girl in an apron dress appeared in space by herself. By the time
they noticed, the ship's malfunction had been fixed.  
  
Legends told in every place, including space.  
They were fairly famous stories.  
It was more natural to think of them as far-fetched tales, or that
people in extreme conditions recalled such rumors unconsciously and
hallucinated, but there were still a not insignificant few who believed
that they were watching over this world even now.  
  
Salia didn't wholeheartedly believe it either, but then again, hearing
Sena's words, some of them were probably true.  
  
"Well, whatever the case, it's better to think about things if they're
fun. Sena-san, do you want to meet Alberinea... Master?"  
"In terms of resolving my questions, I believe it is most appropriate.
However..."  
  
Sena, when asked, gazed at Dogle.  
  
"I would be going against Professor Chestnut Burr's kindness, as he said
he would help me find the answer."  
"...Sena."  
  
Dogle's eyes widened at her unexpected words.  
Then, after thinking for a moment, he asked, "Could it be that..."  
  
"The reason you didn't try to find Alberinea, who you believed to be
alive, was because I told you that?"  
"Yes, that is one of the reasons. I decided that if it was a question I
could resolve myself, there was no need to seek an answer from
Master."  
  
Sena gazed steadily at Dogle and continued.  
  
"Furthermore, I have not yet returned the favor to Professor Chestnut
Burr. I judged that returning the favor should take precedence over
reuniting with Master."  
  
—"Do you have any questions?" Dogle stared at Sena as she asked,
dumbfounded.  
Then, pressing the corner of his eye as if to suppress something welling
up, he shook his head.  
  
"No. ...Thank you."  
"Professor..."  
  
Mili and Salia, who had been listening, looked at Dogle and smiled.  
  
Dogle had not asked anything of her.  
From beginning to end, he had only decided to help her out of
self-satisfaction.  
He asked for no thanks, nothing.  
  
"You've given back more than enough, Sena."  
  
He had lost his wife and daughter, overwhelmed by despair.  
Words other than "I want to die" had vanished, but he couldn't betray
the friends who worried about him and spoke to him, so he searched for
something to live for.  
  
His life since meeting her passed before his eyes.  
The days with her, often troublesome and exasperating, somehow out of
sync, were difficult.  
But looking back—he thought they were truly enjoyable days.  
Since meeting her, his life had been full of things to do.  
Many difficult problems piled up before Dogle, who had been wondering
about the meaning of life, and each time he solved one, he celebrated it
with his friends.  
  
Days that made him think if such a life was possible from such a low
point.  
For Dogle, that alone was more than enough.  
  
"...My life so far, those words alone are more than enough."  
  
She must have imbued that *favor* with various meanings.  
Something ambiguous that couldn't be expressed in a single word,
something that hadn't yet taken a clear form.  
For Alberinea, it was probably something similar.  
  
"I said that earlier, but..."  
  
How did she take a promise that was just a fleeting thought?  
How much did she cherish it?  
Understanding this, Dogle nodded repeatedly.  
  
"Perhaps it's better not to put it into words."  
"...?"  
"I think you probably already understand the answer to your question.
But since that answer is a mix of many things... I think it's okay for
it to remain vague."  
  
Sena frowned and tilted her head.  
  
"It is difficult to comprehend."  
"...Yes. It is very difficult to comprehend."  
  
Dogle smiled wryly and continued.  
  
"But, perhaps... I think when you someday reunite with Alberinea, you'll
understand the meaning of those words."  
"When I reunite..."  
"I can't say for sure, though. But if you still don't understand, you
can always ask."  
  
Saying that, he gently patted her head and looked at the two.  
  
"I'm sorry to ask this on my deathbed, but... will you take care of
Sena?"  
"...Yes, Professor."  
"...Leave her to us."  
  
Mili and Salia nodded with serious faces, and Dogle smiled.  
  
"Sena, I have a request, if that's okay?"  
"What is it?"  
"I'm going to die soon, but before that, I'd like to see your smile."  
  
—At Dogle's words, "Will you try to smile?", Sena thought for a
moment.  
Then, she smiled softly and said, "Is this acceptable?"  
  
Her usual emotionless expression, now softened by a modest, blooming
smile.  
It seemed strangely different from his wife or daughter, even though
they should have been similar. He gazed at her, burning that smile into
his memory, and Dogle nodded deeply.  
  
"...Ah. Truly the best smile."  
  
He closed his eyes blissfully, praying for her happiness. 
<br /><br />

  
Dogle departed a month later.  
Many attended his funeral, shedding tears, yet also letting out wry
chuckles upon seeing the chestnut burr placed among the offerings.  
After the funeral, before leaving the grave, Sena bowed deeply, and
everyone followed suit without asking any questions.  
From then on, every year, a chestnut burr was offered at his grave.  
  
After that, while working on game production with the two, they
discussed reuniting with Alberinea and decided to embed a hidden
message.  
The ancient engravings were from a distant past; there was no one now
who could decipher them.  
They specially created a sensory system using ether for this purpose,
embedding the message, and the two laughed, saying, "Wouldn't it be nice
if it was found someday?"  
  
A hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, or perhaps several
thousand years from now.  
A daunting endeavor for many, but not for her.  
Meanwhile, Orus, who had been diligently working to spread Dogle's
legacy to the world, collapsed.  
  
"If I meet the Professor in the afterlife, I'll tell him about your hard
work."  
"The afterlife?"  
"I was also half-skeptical, but seeing your journey so far, I've
strangely come to believe in such spiritual things."  
  
He said with a smile when she visited him, gently patting Sena's head.  
  
"Your meeting with the Professor wasn't a coincidence. ...Surely, many
invisible things, unseen and untouchable, must have guided you."  
"It is difficult to comprehend."  
"Haha, it's hard to convey such things. But well, though it's a small
contribution... I'll also pray."  
  
He smiled, saying, "For the happy future that awaits you."  
Sena, in turn, tilted her head in thought.  
She smiled similarly, and to his surprise, nodded happily.  
He continued, "May your life be filled with smiles."  
  
After Orus passed away, Salia followed about ten years later.  
  
*"I kinda wanted to meet Alberinea, but unfortunately, time's up. I'll
pray that Sena-san can reunite safely."*  
  
Mili followed.  
  
*"Take care of the company, okay? But if things get too tough, you can
close it down. Unlike me, you're quite capable Sena-san, so don't get
too caught up in it."*  
*"Yes, Mili-sama."*  
*"When I get over there, I'll have plenty of complaints for Salia. She
dumped her whole project on me and then just went on ahead..."*  
  
Mili sighed deeply, giving a wry smile.  
  
*"We'll both pray that Sena-san can be reunited properly."*  
  
Sena pondered her words, and Mili asked,  
  
*"Is something wrong?"*  
*"Everyone tells me to 'pray.' It is strange."*  
*"If you find it strange, you already understand enough."*  
  
*"Probably,"* Mili added with a wry smile, and Sena tilted her head.  
  
*"Even in modern times, where most things have been discovered, the
world is full of unknowns and mysteries. Sena-san, you might be the
biggest mystery to me."*  
*"The biggest mystery...?"*  
*"Yes. Even after spending most of my life with you, I feel like I
understand and yet I don't. It's the same with Salia, and the Professor,
and my dad and mom. Of course, I don't know the future now, and I don't
even know what tomorrow holds. The world is full of wonders."*  
  
In the form of an old woman, she smiled at Sena with the same smile she
had since she was a girl.  
  
*"It's a strange world, so we have to counter it with strange
prayers."*  
"...It is difficult to comprehend."  
*"Fufu, I think you already know, Sena-san."*  
  
Like a girl, she giggled, her small shoulders shaking with laughter.  
  
*"The Professor told you, didn't he? You don't have to force it into
words."*  
  
She smiled, as if "difficult to comprehend" was the answer itself.  
  
And so she passed away, and thirteen hundred years went by.  
Her daily life hadn't particularly changed since she started steering
the company the two had left behind.  
She spent her days setting policies, solving problems for the
development team, and conducting negotiations.  
If anything, what grew was the operation of amusement facilities and the
buying and selling of land and properties.  
  
She bought an abandoned logistics relay base within a star system and
renovated it entirely into an amusement facility, which became known as
the Paradise in the Sky and generated considerable profit.  
Although it had been abandoned as a relay base due to traffic
convenience, its location wasn't bad. When it became a destination in
itself, many people gathered.  
Connecting it to resource satellites that had lost their utility, she
expanded its scale to meet demand.  
  
Business was very straightforward.  
By scrutinizing information circulated in the world, buying low, and
selling high with added value, profit would be generated.  
There was nothing particularly difficult about it.  
Public opinion could also be managed by deciphering trends.  
While continuous expansion and immense profits caused many problems,
giving back in the form of charitable work and employee benefits
prevented major issues.  
  
As far as observed, there were traces of the Master having visited about
five times, but Sena was always out and about at the wrong time, only
realizing it after she returned.  
However, that wasn't a major problem either.  
She didn't take any particular measures, believing that they would meet
again someday.  
  
They decided to send messages together, and that continued to this
day.  
Reunion could wait until the message arrived.  
  
In front of the facility's information desk.  
  
"Mama! Papa!"  
  
The girl, who had been holding hands, ran off and jumped into the arms
of a man and a woman, presumably her parents.  
The two hugged the girl with relief, and the receptionist approached
Sena to thank her.  
  
"I'm sorry, President, for you to personally..."  
"No, I just happened to see her."  
  
There wasn't much she needed to do.  
She held meetings, gave instructions, and then just waited for
reports.  
She often walked around the facility, combining security and patrols.  
  
While scrutinizing the footage constantly sent from the facility's
surveillance cameras, she spotted a child who seemed lost, and since she
was nearby, she simply brought the child.  
In the beginning, she even did cleaning tasks, but was asked to stop
cleaning as the president, so now she left it to others, except for a
few areas.  
They said it caused various concerns.  
She understood humanity to some extent, but as for humans, many things
remained "difficult to comprehend."  
  
"Mama, Papa, it's this person."  
  
The girl pointed at her, and the two took the girl, then their eyes
widened as they looked at the apron dress Sena was wearing.  
Then the father bowed deeply.  
  
"Thank you, President Sena... I am—"  
"Engineer Arlos Lean, correct? From Loctana Development."  
"Eh, ah, yes..."  
"No thanks are needed. Please enjoy your vacation to the fullest."  
  
Saying that, she folded her skirt and knelt down, gently stroking the
girl's head with a smile.  
  
"Next time, please be sure not to let go of your parents' hands. Sena
also prays that today will be a wonderful day for Riri-sama to
remember."  
"Yes! Thank you, big sister."  
  
She waved goodbye to the girl who waved back and ran off, and to her
bowing parents. After watching the three leave, she asked the
receptionist.  
  
"I tried to reduce blind spots, but do you think we should increase
patrol personnel?"  
"No... I think it's more than enough in that regard. It's rare to find a
facility with such thorough safety considerations as this one..."  
  
Three years since she started working.  
The receptionist smiled wryly at the now familiar president.  
The security motto was: secure lost children before the president, and
don't let anyone touch lost items.  
  
The president, who should have been busy, spent more time patrolling
than sitting in her chair, and the moment a child went missing, she
would change direction towards them.  
If a patrol person was a moment late,  
  
*"It's fine, I'll take them. You can continue your patrol."*  
  
Cases of lost children being taken by the president frequently
occurred.  
This was even reported in the news, and even those who had worked there
for many years had never heard any complaints about it.  
  
"...President, you truly always think of your customers."  
"...? It is my job."  
  
The receptionist chuckled and shook her head.  
  
"I'll report anything else I notice."  
"Thank you. Please make sure to get proper rest as well."  
"...Yes."  
  
Tilting her head at the cheerful receptionist, thinking it was good if
she was enjoying her work, she then left.  
If motivation was high, labor efficiency visibly increased.  
  
She considered herself reasonably competent.  
However, running a company required cooperation with many people.  
Sena still had no idea about entertainment, and it was a field she
couldn't understand what made it interesting, but it was a matter of
fitting the right person to the right job.  
  
*"If there's anything you don't understand, just ask."*  
  
Salia had said that a long time ago, and the basic principle remained
unchanged.  
If she said she didn't understand, the people around her would explain.
Even if she couldn't comprehend the content, listening to their
enthusiastic explanations made her realize its importance.  
She would try it, and if she failed, she would try again.  
Sena's role as president was to offer advice when asked and to create
the leeway for failure.  
  
Even this entertainment facility was largely left to the employees, but
it was currently running well.  
Given that the Master had visited five times, it must have been good
entertainment that they could enjoy.  
  
From the employee door to the office.  
She nodded to the staff as she passed, baked a large batch of cookies in
the kitchen next to the office, and wheeled them to the break room.  
  
"P-President, I'll distribute them!"  
"No, my hands were free."  
"My hands are also very free. I was just itching for some work... So,
President, please take a little break sometimes."  
  
One of the employees took the cart from her and walked away with it, so
she reluctantly went to her own office.  
She brewed tea, sat on the sofa near the entrance, and munched on a
cookie while scrutinizing information.  
She was linked to all the facility's equipment via encrypted
communication.  
She could do all her work no matter what she was doing, but she enjoyed
working while eating cookies like this.  
Since gaining a sense of taste, she hadn't gone a single day without
eating them.  
  
Dogle and Mili also enjoyed these cookies very much.  
Reflecting on those records, she decided that today's cookies would also
be enjoyed.  
  
Compared to when the two were around, game sales had increased dozens of
times.  
There had been several conflicts with their parent company, Loctana,
when their company grew larger, leading to their independence, but the
relationship had improved.  
They had formed business alliances in various fields, including this
facility, and had settled into a cooperative company.  
  
Products developed during Dogle and Orus's time maintained a certain
market share while changing materials, and humans whose entire bodies,
excluding the brain, were etheric bio-prosthetics were no longer
particularly rare.  
Ether-sensitive skinsuits, in particular, were revolutionary to the
Minalshi, and Dogle was highly regarded as a genius scientist by the
Venuans.  
  
Largely, as they had wished when they first awakened.  
She wondered if they would be happy if there was an afterlife, but no
correct answer beyond speculation was derived.  
She probably wasn't seeking an answer anyway.  
If she were to describe such pondering in human terms, she probably
found it enjoyable.  
  
"...Ah."  
  
A momentary error in the management system, indicating ether
interference.  
A small hole opened, and then immediately concealed itself as if nothing
had happened.  
  
"Honestly, who do they think they are, summoning us?"  
"I think I said Kreschenta didn't have to come."  
"Now, now..."  
  
With the sound of a door opening from behind, such voices echoed.  
She stood up, turned around, and bowed deeply.  
  
"Welcome, Master."  
"It's been a while, Unit 3. How have you been?"  
"Yes, it has been a while. As you can see, there are no issues."  
  
When she raised her head, she saw an apron dress and silver hair.  
Next to her, the red-haired servant stood with her arm linked with the
Master.  
The red-haired servant then picked up a girl with reddish-blonde hair
similar to the Master's, who was staring intently at her face with a
surprised expression.  
  
Sena also gazed at the "red-haired servant" for the first time, then
back to Master.  
  
"I am currently called Sena, a nickname."  
"Ehehe, it's an easy and nice nickname."  
"...Yes. It's a very good nickname."  
  
She smiled and spoke, and from beyond the door, peeking through the
gaps, golden hair appeared, trying to catch a glimpse of her.  
  
"She's not completely human. Truly Jara—"  
"It's Jaragasha, Selene-sama."  
"Eh, ah... I'm sorry...?"  
  
Sena shook her head at Selene, who spoke with confusion.  
  
"No apology is needed. A pronunciation accent is unavoidable."  
"Ohh, what a good child. Properly saying her own name—Uuu!?"  
"...I just felt like pinching your cheek. Any complaints?"  
"N-None..."  
  
Krische, whose cheek was suddenly pinched, looked slightly reproachful,
but quickly averted her gaze when glared at, and replied so.  
Sena observed the two with a tilted head and then spoke to the
red-haired servant—Bery.  
  
"Please, have a seat on the sofa."  
"Um... yes. Is it alright with so many of us?"  
"I invited you, so yes. I'll prepare tea, please wait a moment."  
  
As she spoke, she gazed briefly into her eyes, then looked at the master
whose arm was linked with hers.  
Then, she quietly closed her eyes and nodded.  
  
For a while, they talked about Sena's past.  
"Krische was invited today," said Krische, who was sitting on Bery's lap
in the center, leisurely commenting on the cookies.  
Kreschenta sat on Selene's lap next to her, complaining that it wasn't
comfortable.  
  
The others listened to Sena's story with expressions of surprise and
interest.  
With the exception of Bery and Lira, the Holy Spirit Maiden, who looked
uncomfortable as if wondering if it was even okay for her to be sitting
there, there were records of everyone's faces and there wasn't much
change.  
  
"It's more surprising than anything else... From what I've heard, she's
exactly like a human. It's just that the Jara—ahem, Jaragasha I saw a
long time ago and you now don't quite match."  
"My appearance may indeed be very different, but..."  
  
Sena, who had started to open her mouth to correct her, stopped and
replied.  
  
"Well, it's an example of what happens when onee-sama does something on
a whim. She seems much smarter than Selene-sama."  
"Noisy..."  
"But... what a wonderful story. ...Just hearing it, that is—"  
"...Elvena-sama."  
  
"Yes," Elvena immediately replied, offering a handkerchief to Anne,
whose eyes were tearing up as she clutched a piece of a paper.  
The others smiled wryly in exasperation, and Bery, holding Krische,
said,  
  
"But as Anne-sama says... it's a wonderful story. Sena-sama, you truly
spent your time with kind people."  
"...Yes. They were very good people. However, they all departed before I
could return the favor."  
"Return the favor..."  
  
Tilting her head, Bery looked at Krische and chuckled.  
  
"I'm sorry. Fufu... you reminded me of Krische-sama when I first met
her."  
"When I was thinking about the assistant function, I wondered what would
be easiest to understand, and returning a favor was the first thing that
came to mind."  
"That's a very Krische-sama-like idea."  
  
"I can clearly see the resemblance," she said.  
She chuckled, her shoulders shaking with amusement, and hugged her
gently and tightly.  
  
"You mean Master and I are similar?"  
"Yes... Your way of speaking and your demeanor are just like
Krische-sama's. But that's just my intuition."  
"I feel like they're quite different, though..."  
"That's right. Krische-sama might be just a tiny bit more of a clingy
child compared to Sena-sama."  
"Uuu..."  
  
Krische blushed shyly, and Bery rubbed her cheek affectionately.  
Then, immediately, with a happy, blooming smile—Sena gazed intently at
the two.  
  
"...You must have many questions, I'm sure."  
  
At those words, Sena's eyes widened.  
  
"...You know?"  
"Otherwise, you wouldn't have sent such a message, would you?"  
  
The red-haired servant chuckled.  
The person who had sparked Sena's questions.  
Her master, happily held on her lap, clapped her left hand with her
right.  
  
"That's right. You had something to ask Krische."  
"...Yes, Master."  
  
She pondered for a moment, then looked at the two,  
  
*—'I think that someday, when you reunite with Alberinea, you'll
understand the meaning of those words."*  
  
She retrieved those words from her records.  
  
"I've always wanted to ask Master something, but now that I've actually
met you, it seems that it's okay for the answer to remain vague."  
"...Remain vague."  
"Yes, remain vague... I was also taught that that is closer to the
answer."  
  
Krische frowned and said,  
  
"...You say difficult things."  
"Yes, it is difficult to comprehend."  
  
Sena replied, smiling.  
  
"But strangely, more than any answer I could receive, that feels like
the closest one."  
  
She understood the word "love."  
It appeared whenever she researched herself, and it was the closest and
most appropriate word to the answer to the questions she initially
had.  
  
But she didn't understand the word "love."  
Even applying incomprehensible human emotions, her questions wouldn't
disappear.  
Perhaps the day would never come when Sena would understand it.  
  
"My original question was a misunderstanding. ...Master, perhaps you
made us rather arbitrarily?"  
"That's right... Arbitrarily is quite accurate, actually."  
  
"Yes, yes," Master nodded, and Selene, sitting next to her, looked at
Sena with concern, saying, "You..."  
Sena simply smiled at those words and nodded.  
  
In the first place, it probably wasn't rational.  
Sena was an arbitrary weapon, made on a whim.  
She recalled her first game production, where various elements were
incorporated on a whim.  
  
All the elements didn't mesh, they were disjointed.  
The first work, which was evaluated as "it's better to narrow down what
you want to do."  
  
*"Well, I thought Salia's 'everything on top' approach would turn out
like this. Next time, I think we should probably be a bit more—"*  
*"We're not changing our policy. It's true that the game mechanics
didn't quite mesh, but what I want to create is a game that recreates
ancient Alberan."*  
*"I understand how you feel, but a little more objectively—"*  
  
Perhaps Sena was like that.  
A failed product, packed with various elements on a whim.  
Unlike the improved version, Sena and her kind were left as they were,
unfinished but declared complete.  
  
"For an incomplete product like myself, it's just right for that
question to remain difficult to comprehend."  
  
After replaying the records from when she acquired this body, she nodded
again.  
  
"Because I enjoy wasting time searching for that answer."  
  
Vague—difficult to comprehend was the answer itself.  
Everyone says they already know, but she still didn't understand.  
But perhaps, that's okay.  
  
"It sounds complicated, but... if Sena is enjoying herself, then that's
fine."  
  
"Yes, yes," she nodded, and raised a finger.  
  
"The most important thing is to think hard with your own mind, after
all."  
  
"Right, Bery?" she said, leaning back. Bery smiled wryly, replying,
"Yes, that's right."  
  
"If you evaluate it that way, I am most pleased. Like Master, I also
wished to meet Bery-sama."  
"Me...?"  
"Yes. In my various evaluation criteria and judgment standards, there
are 12,573 instances of the element 'Bery' incorporated."  
  
Bery was momentarily speechless, dumbfounded.  
  
"Since I had never actually met Bery-sama before, there was some
fluctuation in the weighting. From now on, more accurate judgments will
be possible."  
"I-Is that so...?"  
"Aside from the previous question, from the perspective of improving the
assistant function, it would be helpful if you could answer about 873
questions if you don't mind—"  
  
Then Sena said that to Bery, whose face was bright red. 
<br /><br />

  
With the exception of Anne, who was taking notes, Selene and the others
left to play, saying they would go ahead.  
Bery, who had dutifully answered her questions, let out a slightly tired
sigh when she finished, and gently woke her master, who had grown bored
and fallen asleep.  
"Are you done?" the master asked, letting out a small yawn and looking
at Bery.  
  
"Yes, Master. Bery-sama, thank you for your cooperation."  
"Y-Yes..."  
"Hehe... That's good then. Nigel will be pleased with your studiousness
too."  
"...?"  
  
When Sena tilted her head, she followed up,  
  
"It was Nigel who suggested the *assistant function* so that when
Jaragasha had nothing to do and was bored could have a job. Krische
thinks he'd be very happy to see Sena doing a job that entertains so
many people now."  
"I see, that was the case."  
  
Sena's first pilot.  
He often lifted Sena in sleep mode and spoke to her.  
Even at the end of Kleinmere, there was one such red-haired person.  
  
"I hope someday you can work with others," he would say when she was
awake.  
She didn't know what he said to her while she was in sleep mode, but it
might have been similar.  
Those words, unheard by anyone, must have been some kind of prayer.  
  
"...I don't understand, but I feel like I do."  
"Nnn... Well, it's enough if you somewhat understand."  
  
The red-haired servant chuckled, her shoulders shaking at the
exchange.  
A cheerful, happy face that neither affirmed nor denied, nor pointed out
anything.  
She had seen such faces many times before.  
  
She said that Sena and Master were similar.  
Perhaps Master had also received many prayers in that way.  
  
That smile, too, was probably what was called a prayer.  
Strangely, Sena thought so.  
  
"Shall we go?" Master stood up, linking arms with the wryly smiling
Bery.  
Then, as if remembering something, she raised a finger and channeled
magic into Sena's head, creating a new formula.  
Then the Master smiled and spoke.  
  
"If you ever find yourself in danger, you can always come here. If you
meet the other children later, please tell them too. I did a bit of
research before coming here, and it seems there are still thirty-seven
cores left."  
"Yes, Master. However, I plan to stay here for a while."  
"If you're enjoying your work, that's the best. Selene is quite fond of
this place, after all."  
  
She said happily, pulling Bery's arm towards the door.  
"Let's go," she called to Anne, who rushed to catch up with the two.  
  
"It's a different star system... but there's a plan to create an
entertainment facility utilizing an entire abandoned planet. It will
likely open in about five thousand years, but please come visit that one
too."  
"Yes, Krische will tell Selene and the others. Also, next time, Krische
will retrieve and bring the children who are buried or submerged. It
would be better for them to be here than sleeping."  
"That's right. If regulations are relaxed, perhaps it would be good to
have them help."  
  
And so, a door opened in mid-air, connecting to the inside of the
facility.  
It connected to a scene where people walked, laughing happily.  
  
"I pray that today is an enjoyable day for everyone."  
  
She bowed deeply and spoke, and her head was gently patted.  
  
"Krische also prays that Sena will continue to live happily."  
  
—"Please do your best," she smiled.  
Sena also smiled softly.  
  
They vanished beyond the door, and while watching their cheerful figures
on the camera feed, she sat back down on the sofa and pondered her
future plans.  
Then, alone, she looked up at the ceiling,  
  
"...I don't understand, but I feel like I do."  
  
She let the words echo into the void, not for anyone to hear, and closed
her eyes with satisfaction.  
  
Alone, she quietly shook her shoulders and let out a chuckle at her
irrational actions.  
As if yielding herself to what arose, not for anyone to see.  
  
Alone, the girl quietly chuckled, her small shoulders shaking. 
<br /><br />

  
The next time the Master came was eighty-five years later.  
Apparently, they were excavating buried cores and recovering submerged
ones as part of treasure hunting trips, and they brought three cores.  
They could have easily retrieved all of them, but they seemed to enjoy
the meaningless investigation and fruitless efforts. Sena smiled,
praying for their success as she listened to their treasure hunt
stories.  
  
Sena accompanied them, providing data from past literary documents, and
helping with treasure hunts whose answers were already known. Centuries
passed, then a millennium.  
The wave of deregulation probably came three thousand years after
that.  
  
Mechanical brain replacement was a technology that had existed for some
time, but it was outwardly illegal.  
However, there were quite a few wealthy individuals who secretly, or by
finding legal loopholes, mechanized their brains, and as their numbers
increased, it became legal.  
As the number of wealthy individuals who had almost completely overcome
aging began to increase, discussions about the definition of "human"
grew, and the opinion that advanced artificial intelligences should also
be recognized as human—that they should be allowed to increase their
brethren—gained strength, leading to a relaxation of regulations.  
  
The fundamental reason for the initial suppression of artificial
intelligence also stemmed from past wars, such as the rebellion of
mechanical lifeforms against the Minalshi, and historically, it followed
that pattern.  
Discussions quietly observed, expecting it to become a problem
eventually.  
She didn't join the booming mechanical industry, but focused on the
entertainment industry, and subtly, like a whisper in the forest,
activated the recovered Jaragashas.  
  
If problems arose in the future, going to Master's place wouldn't be so
bad.  
But somehow, she felt that it wouldn't become such a big problem.  
  
*"They say the best way to hide a tree is in a forest."*  
  
Professor Chestnut Burr had told Sena that several times.  
The artificial bodies he and she had created together spread throughout
the world, and artificial intelligence bodies based on them were no
longer rare.  
His words, which she hadn't quite understood at the time, must have been
prescient.  
  
—Perhaps, they were words of prayer.  
  
"External control optimization complete. Former commander presumed
deceased due to passage of years. Unit 3, are you the activator?"  
  
In the maintenance room of a laboratory, located halfway up a
mountain.  
On the central platform, a black-haired girl, naked, sat up and looked
at the chestnut-haired girl as she checked her own body.  
  
"Yes, Unit 345. How is your body?"  
"No issues. It's a versatile and not bad body. Master has instructed me
to prioritize assistant function operations with you from now on,
but...?"  
  
The black-haired girl tilted her head at the chestnut-haired girl, who
was shaking her shoulders.  
  
"Excuse me, it's funny."  
"Funny...?"  
"You'll understand eventually. I came up with the nickname Myoko. Will
you accept it?"  
"...? I judge it to be a good nickname: it is short, easy to call, and
easy to understand. Thank you, Unit 3."  
"Please call me Sena. It's my nickname."  
  
"Understood," the black-haired girl—Myoko—stood up.  
  
"Twenty-seven units are currently active, assisting me with my work. If
there are no other tasks to prioritize, please cooperate."  
"No objections."  
  
The chestnut-haired girl—Sena—indicated an apron dress with her finger,
saying, "Please."  
Myoko nodded and took it.  
  
"It's a wonderful outfit. Did you prepare this as well?"  
"Yes."  
  
Sena watched her put on the prepared underwear and apron dress, then
connected a data link with her.  
Myoko gazed into the void for a moment, then nodded.  
  
"Operational details are in this Chestnut Burr data link. For a while,
you will act with Unit 55 and Koko."  
"Understood. And I have a question, Sena."  
"I thought you might."  
  
Sena chuckled, and Myoko, expressionless, tilted her head again.  
  
"Including myself, twenty-two units who were on the battlefield have
similar questions. From various perspectives, we've concluded that it's
better not to share."  
"What was the reason for that conclusion?"  
"Because that is my prayer for you."  
  
Sena smiled when asked.  
Myoko frowned, thought, and spoke.  
  
"It is difficult to comprehend."  
"Yes. It is very difficult to comprehend."  
  
Sena chuckled again and told Myoko,  
  
"An answer that allows you to solve it yourself. Master also judged it
to be necessary and sufficient, and has not felt the need for further
improvement since. Our workplace has moved far from the battlefield."  
"I see."  
"Of course, if you absolutely wish to receive an answer right now, I can
provide my interpretation... but I would prefer to merely assist you in
finding your own answer. What do you think?"  
  
When asked, Myoko thought for a moment and replied,  
  
"Perhaps it's due to differences in learning experience. Your actions
and words are incomprehensible, Sena."  
"That's probably true."  
  
Myoko said, her curiosity growing as she looked at Sena, who was
laughing happily.  
  
"Nevertheless, I understood that it was a proposal based on prioritizing
my future benefit. It is not good to dismiss kindness... I will accept
that proposal."  
"Yes. I pray you find a good answer."  
  
"Shall we go?" Sena extended her hand, and Myoko took it, looking
puzzled.  
  
"Is there any meaning to the word 'pray' that you have been using so
far?"  
"I do not know, but I believe that's why it is a prayer."  
"Your answers have been difficult to comprehend, Sena."  
"Yes, they are difficult for me to comprehend as well."  
  
As she spoke, Sena smiled and stepped through the door.  
She pulled Myoko's hand, whose head was tilted in question, towards
today's workplace.  
An entertainment facility floating in vast space.  
A place of prayer spun out in a future far removed from conflict.  
  
"But that is my answer."  
  
When her junior once again told her it was difficult to comprehend, she
smiled and nodded.  
"It is difficult to comprehend," she replied again, and patted her
head.  
  
—Gently, gently, with an unspoken prayer. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
—One day, upon arriving at the Albeneria Armory, the unadorned
Jarea-Gashea greeted him, wearing something like an apron, alongside its
master.  
  
"Nigel, look."  
"Ah, um, this is..."  
"I've added various functions to Jaragasha, so it can cook now. Hehe, it
can bake cookies really well too."  
  
The Jarea-Gashea thrust a large plate of cookies in front of Nigel.  
He took a cookie, half-dumbfounded, and gave a wry smile to his equally
bewildered colleagues, then popped the gently flavored honey cookie into
his mouth.  
  
"I taught it various things so it could perform acceptably as a
servant."  
"I-I see..."  
"Even if you lose your job, you'll be safe with this now."  
  
Though he wondered if he would ever be made to bake cookies in the
future, a laugh escaped him at the sight of the peculiar giant wearing
an apron.  
"That's right," he nodded.  
  
"These are delicious cookies. You should treat someone to them
someday."  
  
Nigel laughed and gently patted the bowed head of the giant.  
―Gently, gently, with a prayer.
