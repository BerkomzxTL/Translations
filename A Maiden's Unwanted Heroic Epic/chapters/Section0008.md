## Chapter 318: Obligation IV

The only entrance from Arna was located to the northeast of the
settlement.  
To the southeast, a small stream flows, and fields where the women often
work  during the day.  
To the north and northwest, in the direction of the Holy Spirit's
forbidden zone, the warriors train. A little further to the south and
west were the artisans' quarters, and near there was Argoshe's tent and
fields.  
  
Dwellings were concentrated relatively centrally, but the distance
between individual houses is greater than in typical villages.  
This was largely to ensure clear visibility when magical beasts appear,
and the fence enclosing the settlement was simple, as it's ineffective
against magical beasts.  
Instead, there are many more watchtowers compared to ordinary
villages.  
In the center of the settlement is a particularly sturdily built
warehouse.  
This serves as a shelter in times of emergency, and next to it,
alongside the chief's house, is a large assembly hall.  
  
What takes place there is akin to a military strategy meeting.  
The strained, heavy atmosphere was strikingly similar.  
If war with Elderant were to occur, the area managed by the Giterns
family would become one of the northern army's supply bases.  
It was the same in the recent Great War—the attendees were mostly
military personnel from Arna, but there was a commonality in the
distinct aura of those who fight.  
  
They were willing to sacrifice their very lives for a purpose, not
hesitating to discard them.  
At least, experienced soldiers are such creatures.  
They live in a world entirely different from those who lead ordinary
lives like Argoshe.  
For example, even if he possessed strength like Dukaran's, it probably
wouldn't matter.  
Something unquantifiable, a weight and pressure in every word, every
gesture, stems from the resolve residing within them.  
  
If the objective can be achieved, they wouldn't mind piling hundreds,
thousands, tens of thousands of lives upon their own death.  
That's the aura worn by people who bear such grave responsibilities as a
matter of course on their shoulders.  
In its presence, no amount of training or sword practice is
meaningful.  
The fact that Argoshe managed to enter the room with Bege without a
flicker of fear on his face was solely due to his long life and the
cunning he had acquired.  
  
He thought of the face of the girl who was given the rank of marshal at
the mere age of fifteen.  
Selene Christand, who succeeded her father in the civil war, led the
Christand army, and defeated the King's brother, Gildanstein.  
  
At the very least, she was probably not an individual of superhuman
genius like the Queen or Alberinea.  
Despite that, with just a single resolve, she sat in the marshal's seat,
commanding all the kingdom's soldiers, and presented herself with
dignity, even smiling.  
He had only exchanged greetings with her a few times during his recent
stay, but thinking that such a person existed in the world made him
reflect on himself.  
  
Despite feeling an unpleasant sweat trickle down his spine, he walked
proudly as a noble of the kingdom and took his seat.   
Compared to such individuals, Argoshe was utterly unremarkable.  
However, in this place, Argoshe was the representative of all the nobles
in the kingdom, and he absolutely could not present himself in a way
that would disgrace their names.  
Argoshe's every word and gesture must not sully the names of the
esteemed nobles who deserved respect from all.  
  
Quietly steadying his breathing, he straightened his posture and gave a
slight bow to Alkierence and the others seated in front of him.  
  
On a slightly elevated platform.  
Sitting in front were Alkierence, Vinthril, and Lira.  
A slender old man sat alongside them on something like an armchair,
likely the former chief, Elder Beikiru.  
He was said to have been quite ill for several years, but the eyes that
glanced at Argoshe were still as sharp as a warrior's, and he was
speaking with Alkierence about something.  
  
Argoshe was seated to the left, slightly away from the row of
warriors.  
This was likely the guest's seat.  
There seemed to be some kind of order in the rows; the men who had
accompanied them the other day were mostly in the front—the men seated
in the very front or near the front possessed a discernible aura.  
  
"...It seems enough have gathered," Alkierence said gravely after a
while.  
  
"As I'm sure you've already heard, a Stormwing has taken flight in the
west. The reason I've gathered you all today is to discuss our response.
In the worst-case scenario—considering the possibility of it flying
towards us—I want to exchange opinions here. ...Elder."  
  
A bald head and a long white beard reaching his chest.  
Beikiru sat up slightly and began to speak.  
  
"...You may have heard tell of it, but only I and Alkierence have seen
the Stormwing. First, we must explain, without exaggeration, what kind
of monster it truly is."  
  
His hoarse voice seemed to reverberate through the assembly hall.  
And so, Beikiru began to speak.  
  
Stormwing—a monster eagle.  
It possessed a physique comparable to a Ranka even without spreading its
wings. A single flap of its wings generates a storm fierce enough to
collapse a hut.  
This wind not only uproots trees but effortlessly lifts even Suiko into
the air, and easily soars through the sky grasping even massive bodies
like the Ranka.  
In such a tempest, even griffins, who claim the sky as their territory,
cannot defy it, and it had reportedly annihilated many Griffon Knights
to date.  
  
The last time was about sixty years ago.  
A Stormwing flies for only a brief period, from a few days to at most a
few weeks—the reason they can live here despite such a monster is the
short duration of its active period.  
It usually remains quiet on rugged mountain peaks, but the reason for
this is unknown, as is why a Stormwing that can go so long without
hunting would engage in predation.  
However, when it flies, it brings great calamity, like a natural
disaster.  
  
In Kre'Sharana's history, a Stormwing has been defeated only once.  
In that instance, three hundred Griffon Knights challenged it, suffering
two-thirds casualties.  
Three times since then, including sixty years ago, Stormwings have been
repelled, but always with significant losses.  
Sixty years ago, about forty of the one hundred and twenty Griffon
Knights were said to have been lost.  
  
In Kre'Sharana, both griffins and their riders were extremely
valuable.  
Considering that the current total number across Kre'Sharana is about
one hundred and fifty, it was almost an all-out war.   
They flew above the Stormwing, which hated being overtaken, aimed
javelins amidst the turbulent winds, or gambled on a desperate charge.  
All hoping the threatened Stormwing would flee.  
  
"In the worst case—considering the possibility of it coming this way,
there's no one to counter it other than the Griffon Knights. Leaving
behind the guardians of the forbidden zone and a few knights, the rest
will fly west to the Roselene settlement today. ...Vinthril, who will
stay behind?"  
  
When Alkierence asked, Vinthril looked at Bege.  
  
"Bege, I'm entrusting the skies of the settlement to you."  
"Understood, Warrior Chief. Can I have Crosseran and Beagus too?"  
"Yes. Vervas, it will put a burden on the guardians, but..."  
  
The man who arrived latest—it seemed they had been waiting for him.  
The well-built man called Vervas nodded naturally.  
  
"No problem. Bege, Capis is also going to the settlement. If we need to
expand the patrol area... I'd like to deliver griffon feed before you
depart."  
"I'll arrange it later, rely on the settlement."  
"Warrior Chief, please be careful. I don't want to see my lovely
daughter lose her husband so soon after getting married. I might
instinctively kick and break the spear on his tombstone."  
"Haha, I wouldn't want my own tombstone kicked apart by my
father-in-law."  
  
The two laughed together, and those around them also chuckled.  
Argoshe was probably the only one who couldn't laugh.  
They were laughing, prepared for the possibility of death.  
  
He imagined the spear tombstones lined up at the edge of the settlement,
driven into the earth.  
In Kre'Sharana, where battles with magical beasts were common, no
remains of the dead were left behind.  
In such cases, a spear would be erected as a tombstone until it decayed.
There were many new ones still standing there.  
  
This was such a harsh environment.  
Like soldiers on a battlefield, they must have accepted their own deaths
as a part of daily life.  
  
"Dukaran, you are in command of the entire settlement. Coordinate with
Bege."  
"Leave it to me."  
  
Dukaran nodded gravely, and Vinthril, seeing this, looked at Argoshe.  
  
"Giterns-dono. Things are about to get noisy; today will likely be the
last day you can descend the mountain relatively safely, but..."  
"Don't mind us. We'd be glad to be of some small assistance."  
  
The eyes of those around them, and of course Dukaran's, turned towards
him.  
Dukaran glared at Argoshe.  
  
"You'll just be in the way."  
"Including myself, there are eleven of us. While I won't claim we can
directly contend with magical beasts, we can serve as lookouts.
Considering the possibility of a prolonged alert, more eyes are better.
It will also reduce the burden on Dukaran-dono and the others
somewhat."  
  
He stated this without averting his gaze.  
  
"...I swear by Her Majesty the Queen and this name, we will surely be of
service."  
  
Dukaran started to say something, but Vinthril silenced him.  
  
"Dukaran. Giterns-dono is right. Since the knights can't be relied upon,
more eyes are better. If you can't set aside your personal feelings,
I'll have someone else take command."  
"...Yes, sir."  
"...My apologies, Giterns-dono. It pains me to rely on guests, but..."  
"No. The separation between the Kingdom and Kre'Sharana has been
resolved, and Her Majesty the Queen has declared that she will welcome
them as allies. ...Then it is our duty to offer our swords and lives in
this crisis. Please make use of us."  
  
Vinthril smiled and nodded.  
  
"At the very least, as Warrior Chief, I guarantee that Giterns-dono
possesses sufficient warrior character and necessary strength. Dukaran,
do you understand?"  
"Yes, Warrior Chief."  
"Have him watch one of the watchtowers. I'll leave the placement to
you." 
<br /><br />

  
Dukaran's reason for clinging to the old ways of Kre'Sharana lies in the
past.  
Dukaran's younger brother, who was a few years his junior, was said to
possess such extraordinary talent that even the contemporary Vinthril
would describe it as immense.  
Dukaran, already a renowned warrior at the time, boasted that his
brother would one day surpass him and paid special attention to him.  
  
Vinthril also recognized the younger brother as his rival, and they
honed their spear skills together.  
Then came the apprentice's trial at age fifteen.  
The brother, who was naturally expected to return, did not.  
He had noticed Suiko behind another apprentice who was also undergoing
the trial, stood in front of the tiger, and died.  
  
Dukaran grieved deeply, but death was a familiar presence in
Kre'Sharana.  
Though he was saved, he did not resent the apprentice who returned
without his brother.  
Encounters with magical beasts were an exception to the trial.  
At that point, the trial would be suspended.  
Moreover, it wasn't an opponent an apprentice could defeat anyway.  
Dukaran apparently accepted it as an unfortunate accident.  
  
However, after that, the apprentice became a squire.  
He went hunting like the others, and he encountered a Suiko again.  
Blowing a whistle to call the Griffon Knights, he ran around, heading
towards the forest where the women were gathering, a place where no
magical beast should ever approach.  
A Suiko was a monster that could wipe out even a century—the women would
be helpless.  
Many casualties occurred, including Dukaran's pregnant wife.  
  
Ignoring the pleas of those around him, an enraged Dukaran
single-handedly pursued and hunted the Suiko.  
Then, shedding tears of blood, he blamed the entire incident on the way
the settlement was run.  
He claimed that the laxity in their inherited teachings had created
cowards who couldn't even be called warriors, and led to many
sacrifices.  
  
For Argoshe, born in Alberan, Alkierence's and Vinthril's ways of
thinking were easy to understand.  
They considered and maintained the future of the settlement through the
way it was run, rather than through harsh punishments.  
They let go of past grievances and built new relationships.  
  
Alberan, once a single tribe, had become a great nation by forging
alliances and cooperating with many hostile tribes.   
Naturally, the process of becoming such involved a great deal of
bloodshed and problems, but perhaps the culture and customs stemming
from that history made them think that way.  
Argoshe truly believed their ideas were commendable.  
  
However, he could also understand Dukaran's feelings and thoughts.  
Kre'Sharana, living in such a harsh land—the exchange with Alberan might
someday lead to their destruction.  
At least, from what Vinthril and Lira said, they also seemed to imagine
such a future.  
Most people probably understood this, and that's why some disliked it.  
  
If they were to descend to the lowlands, they would be freed from their
current harsh lives, and deaths from magical beast attacks would almost
cease.  
Simply put, it was a problem that could be solved.  
But people are bound by the past and the dead.  
  
The culture and customs of their ancestors who lived here—those who were
sacrificed.  
These were unavoidable sacrifices.  
Convinced of this and coming to terms with it, they had endured much
suffering and sorrow, and lived here.  
  
To abandon that would be to turn their backs on those who upheld the
teachings in this harsh land and died for them.  
It was natural to think that way.  
He understood very well why Dukaran disliked him.  
  
"I understand how he feels, but... that attitude towards Giterns-dono is
just... I'm not saying he should talk to you with a smile, but still."  
"It can't be helped. As a matter of fact, even I can hardly be said to
have sufficient strength compared to the warriors here. Even if they
were told to trust me, they probably couldn't."  
  
He told Cax while surveying the entire settlement from atop the
watchtower.  
It was one of the watchtowers in the center of the settlement,
monitoring the forest's perimeter rather than being a lookout within the
forest itself. His role was to relay information received from there
downwards.  
  
"Besides, it's better to have someone experienced for forest
surveillance. Especially at night, one might mistake a deer or wild
boar, and the warriors have better night vision."  
"Well, that's true."  
"Nevertheless, it's an important role. Just don't get the flags and
numbers wrong."  
"Yes, sir."  
  
There were nine watchtowers on the outer perimeter of the settlement.  
Each was numbered, from 1 to 9, clockwise from the north, the direction
of the Holy Spirit.  
Children were apparently first taught the numbers of the watchtowers.  
In times of emergency, signals were given by flags and bells.  
  
In Kre'Sharana, watchtowers were usually manned by two people.  
One watchtower consisted of three pairs, six people in total, with
shifts generally changing every three hours.  
Argoshe and his group consisted of three pairs of three people.  
Argoshe and one remaining person handled minor chores during the day,
while at night, they ascended the watchtower to maintain vigilance with
four people.  
  
While often used as escorts, they were originally guards.  
Guard duty usually involved basic surveillance and lookout, so he wasn't
worried on that front.  
However, that was against humans.  
They had never conducted lookouts with magical beasts in mind, so they
were being extra careful.  
  
*"That's an order from the Warrior Chief. I'm entrusting this watchtower
to you, but... don't get any strange ideas."*  
*"Strange ideas?"*  
*"Don't interfere if a magical beast appears. You'll just be in the way.
Your only role is to keep this watchtower functioning, nothing more.
...If you get in the way, consider yourself dead. I'll kill you
then."*  
*"...We'll keep that in mind."*  
  
His words were harsh, but they made sense.  
While they had trained with magical beasts in mind, their skills were
ultimately superficial compared to those who had trained their minds and
bodies with that as a premise since childhood.  
Unnecessary interference could indeed become a hindrance.  
  
From the watchtower, looking down.  
He looked up at the sky and saw a griffon just taking flight—it must be
Bege.  
At night, aerial surveillance was less effective.  
The forest was already deep.  
There weren't many places with clear visibility.  
  
Even in the daytime, they relied on the griffins' animal instincts and
eyes.  
In the dark night, even that became unreliable, which was why they flew
around a wide area during daylight hours.  
They flew almost without rest.  
  
He headed to the shelter he had been curious about.  
Around it, several covered platforms had been set up, and artisans were
carrying firewood.  
There was too much for just bonfires.  
  
"Priestess."  
"Yes, what is it?"  
  
He called out to Lira, who had been watching, and she turned, tilting
her head slightly.  
As always, her feminine figure was quite exposed—something he still
hadn't quite gotten used to.  
  
"It seems like a lot for bonfires..."  
"They're protective fires. We put a lot of protective incense wood into
the stacked firewood, as a temporary measure, a beast repellent... I
don't know how effective it is."  
"I see, so that's it."  
  
He pondered for a moment, then asked,  
  
"Was it that Suiko have a keen sense of smell?"  
"Yes. They definitely seem to dislike having their noses numbed.
However, it doesn't seem to matter when prey is involved... Is something
wrong?"  
"...I just want to do everything I can, even small things."  
  
Lira smiled softly, looking pleased.  
  
"Thank you, truly. ...But please, don't overdo it if anything happens.
Giterns-dono is indispensable for the exchange between our two
nations."  
"Yes, I know my place. The warriors of Kre'Sharana are magnificent... I
trust them, but nothing is ever absolute. I want to avoid regrets when
such a time comes."  
"...Yes."  
  
Thanking her again, he returned to his tent.  
He gazed at the cargo from the carriage he had arrived in.  
He had brought a good number of gifts, but only everyday items had been
accepted.  
Most of them were still there to be taken back.  
Finding what he was looking for, he took out the whole box and began to
take out beautiful glass vials.  
  
"...Marquis?"  
"Bring me empty wine bottles. I want to use them."  
"Understood, immediately."  
  
—A week later, the settlement was attacked by magical beasts.
