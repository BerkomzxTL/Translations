## Chapter 364: The Silhouette's Hammer

*Clang, clang!* The sound of steel being struck.  
Sparks flew from the descending hammer, momentarily illuminating the
silhouette of his father's profile.  
The earliest image Kace could remember of his father—his most vivid
memories of him were always like this.  
In the dark, striking steel, like a silhouette.  
  
"Mühle, don't let Kace get close."  
"Kace, it's dangerous, don't go in."  
"Uh, okay..."  
  
It looked more frightening than beautiful, yet his eyes were captivated
as if enchanted.  
The sound of sparks flying from the steel.  
From the silhouette's steadily descending hammer, a flash of light
bloomed and then vanished.  
<br/>  
<br/>  
<br/>  

His father—Koz—never asked anything of Kace.  
At least, not a single thing during his childhood.  
If anything, it was his mother who would say, "Do this," "Do that."  
  
"Kace, choose your own way of life. Just because you're my son, you
don't need to forge swords."  
  
When he reached a certain age and gained some discernment, those were
the words his father spoke.  
It was just when he had vaguely been thinking that he would succeed his
father.  
Honestly, he felt angry, wondering why he would say such a thing.  
He had spent his life kept away from the smithy, told not to approach
because it was dangerous, and not to enter without permission. Kace had
finally thought his father would ask for his help.  
  
For Kace, who had been waiting for the words, "Help me with work
starting tomorrow," it was nothing but disappointment.  
He sulked, thinking his father had no intention of teaching him
blacksmithing, nor did he expect anything from him.  
  
From then on, he played idly outside, not caring about household
matters, but his father remained indifferent.  
He would utter a few minor complaints, like "Help your mother with some
chores," but he never asked him to help with his own work or offer to
teach him blacksmithing.  
Half-stubbornly, he repeatedly stayed out until dusk.  
  
The swords his father forged were so magnificent that they captivated
Kace even as a child.  
His father's figure, hammering everything together, was cool and
admirable.  
That's probably why he became even more stubborn.  
He boasted everywhere that he wouldn't succeed his old man even if
asked, and he talked about common dreams, like eventually going to the
battlefield, achieving great deeds, and becoming a hero.  
  
It was during this time that a man named Gallen, his father's former
superior officer, visited.  
He was one of the few people his father still called "Captain" and
treated with a smile, and he was said to be a master archer.  
His father had spoken with pride as he talked about how, at the time,
Gallen was one of the heroes known to everyone in the army, though he
was currently a hunter in his hometown.  
  
It was later that Kace learned that even Bogan Christand, the hero who
later became the general of the northern region, still showed him
respect—at the time, it must have seemed like an exaggerated,
questionable story, but the truth of such things was discernible by
sight.  
Gallen was muscular and stern-faced, but compared to his large father,
he wasn't very tall.  
If asked who looked stronger, one would instinctively answer his father
without thinking, but when the two stood side by side, their sizes
mysteriously reversed.  
His eyes, gazing at the blades lined up in the shop, were chillingly
sharp, and every slight gesture, every movement, carried an
indescribable presence.  
  
Was it intimidation, or perhaps an aura?  
As a child, Kace felt an unknown fear, and up to that point he had only
spoken to Gallen  in greetings. But that day, Koz spoke to him because
Kace had been spouting foolish dreams of becoming a hero.  
He spoke to him on his way out, hoping to get some advice from a real
hero.  
  
Just as Kace had thought from his father's way of speaking, Gallen was a
gentle person, unlike his appearance.  
After quietly listening to Kace's story, he spoke with a wry smile.  
  
"As expected of Koz's son. You speak just like him."  
"Just like...?"  
"Yes. Have you ever heard why Koz went to the battlefield?"  
"No, I haven't..."  
  
His father was injured on the battlefield, leaving him with a lasting
disability in his leg, which was the catalyst for him inheriting the
family blacksmith shop.  
He had heard many stories about his time on the battlefield and the
circumstances of running the smithy, but come to think of it, he had
never specifically asked why he went to the battlefield.  
Most men aspire to be heroes at least once—he hadn't particularly
questioned it.  
  
"You're the exact opposite, actually... Your grandfather was a strict
and serious man, apparently. He enthusiastically taught Koz all about
blacksmithing from childhood to raise him into a full-fledged
blacksmith, but Koz seemed to have found it stifling."  
  
Gallen bought Kace some grilled meat from a street vendor and talked
about his father as they walked.  
  
"He complained to his father, got into a big fight, asked  him if he
only had a future as a blacksmith from birth... He reportedly stormed
out of the house, proclaiming he would become a hero, and went to the
battlefield. The reason is the exact opposite of yours, but he's just
like you now, isn't he?"  
"Huh, no... n-not exactly..."  
"It's not that Koz doesn't expect anything from you, or that he doesn't
want you to succeed him. He himself hated strictness and left home after
fighting with his father, so he's just trying not to say too much to
you, his son, so you don't do the same foolish thing he did."  
  
Gallen chuckled, his shoulders shaking.  
  
"But parental love doesn't always get through... The very son is
sulking, thinking he's not expected to do anything, and wants to leave
home for that very reason."  
  
Kace's face turned red.  
  
"Well, everyone goes through a phase of wanting to rebel against their
parents. My reason for going to the battlefield was similar... I spat at
my father, saying I wouldn't end up as a country hunter, and stormed out
of the house. In the end, I'm now satisfied with life as a country
hunter, even with many irreparable regrets."  
"Regrets..."  
"Yes, many of them."  
  
He smiled wistfully, narrowing his eyes.  
  
"But, Gallen-sama, you were a hero... my old man said so."  
"Indeed, for a time, I gained some fame, and had many invaluable
encounters. What I gained was by no means small, but... still, it's a
life with far more regrets. At least, there were several major regrets I
wouldn't have had if I hadn't left the village like that."  
  
And so, he sat down on a wooden box in front of the house.  
  
"Of course, I'm not saying you'll experience the same regrets as me,
but... it's like a terrible gamble with only huge wins and huge losses.
My first battle, when I didn't know left from right, was a terrible
defeat, and only three people in the century I was in survived... All my
comrades, with whom I drank with and talked about dreams the day before,
died."  
"Eh?"  
"I survived because I was lucky. I just happened to be chosen out of a
hundred, and that's how it is on the battlefield. No matter how strong a
warrior is, if their luck runs out, they die easily. In that respect,
Koz was also lucky to survive... but as a result, he ended up with a
limp, and probably has various other regrets. That's why he doesn't say
much to you, so you don't make the same mistakes."  
  
He patted Kace's head lightly with a wry smile.  
It was a thick, large hand.  
  
"You're sulking about it, that's all. ...It's not that you dislike
succeeding Koz, is it? If it's just that you can't be honest, I'm
telling you for your own good. Don't become a soldier. If you just say,
'Please make me your apprentice,' Koz will gladly teach you."  
  
Saying that, Gallen drew the short sword from his waist.  
He laughed at Kace, who flinched for a moment, and handed it to him.  
  
A sharp blade—a strong, beautiful silver surface.  
It had been repeatedly sharpened and showed its age, but it was
immediately clear who had forged it.  
  
"Koz forges good swords. They are sturdy yet sharp, with a size and
balance suited to the user's skill and physique. I've seen many swords,
but there are only a few in the kingdom who can forge swords like Koz.
...How does this sword appear to you?"  
  
When put on the spot, Kace hesitated while searching for the right
words.  
If he answered what he saw, that would be the answer.  
  
"...Challenging a distant, steep mountain is certainly a proud way of
life. It appears that way to everyone. But that doesn't necessarily mean
the desired treasure lies at the end of it."  
  
The former hero spoke with a strangely sad expression.  
  
"It's not about how it looks to others, but what's truly important to
you. ...That's how you should decide your path. That's this old man's
advice."  
  
The way he spoke, he looked older than his appearance suggested.  
<br/>  
<br/>  
<br/>  

It was a disappointment, if you could call it
that.  
The hero closest to him wasn't the kind of being found in legends or
folklore.  
But when he thought about it with a calm mind, he could understand how
shallow and foolish a gamble the idea of becoming a hero on the
battlefield was.  
Even after deciding to apprentice himself to his father, his hesitation
continued for a while, but then, it happened just before he turned
fifteen—  
Kace was startled when he heard that a boy four years older than him, a
sort of leader among the kids in the neighborhood, had been killed in
his first battle. Kace made up his mind after that.  
  
However, the feeling of simply being carried along by inertia lingered
afterwards.  
Although he had decided to succeed his father by process of elimination,
it wasn't his own choice.  
He didn't have his father's passion, and it felt like it just happened
naturally because he was born the son of a blacksmith.  
  
His father was a craftsman worthy of respect.  
He would spend days finishing a sword he had forged himself, only to
smash it to pieces if there was even a single point he wasn't satisfied
with.  
He would sacrifice time even for eating or sleeping, melt it down, and
start hammering the steel from scratch.  
  
Did he not know the meaning of the word "compromise"?  
He would swing his hammer, scattering sparks, with such intensity that
Kace wondered.  
  
Kace didn't share his father's level of passion.  
He had helped and learned from his father, a top-notch blacksmith, and
thought he could forge decent swords himself.  
In fact, the swords Kace forged were superior to those made by ordinary
blacksmiths, and he didn't think he was making bad swords, but his
father didn't recognize them as proper saleable goods.  
If he forged five, four would become scrap metal, and the remaining one
would be stuck in a barrel and sold cheaply as a mass-produced sword.  
The only reason Kace didn't feel it was harassment was because he knew
the passion his father poured into the inanimate steel.  
But still, he felt a sense of resignation that he couldn't be like his
father.  
  
"Kace. Why do you think this is good enough?"  
"...Isn't it good enough? It cuts, it's sturdy, and it'll last a decent
while. You're too particular, Dad. Ordinary people don't demand that
much, and they don't have the eye for it. For them, it's more than good
enough. We have leeway because the Christand family favors us, but I
think it wouldn't hurt to make more of this quality and earn some
money."  
  
In the cluttered smithy, Koz sighed, looking at Kace's newly completed
sword.  
Kace continued, exasperated with Koz, who had immediately started
complaining without giving him a moment to breathe.  
  
"Of course, your swords are the best, Dad. I can't imitate them, but
it's not worth wasting so many to make just one. It would be different
if they were decorative swords worth ten gold coins, but sometimes we
even lose money. Even this sword should be incomparable to mass-produced
ones, right? It's certainly not perfect, but—"  
"Failing when striving for perfection and forging with the mindset that
'good enough' is fine are completely different. I'm asking about your
mindset. You have good potential. The quality of this sword isn't bad;
in fact, it's superior to those of ordinary blacksmiths. But you're not
aiming for anything beyond that."  
  
Koz set the sword down and sat on a chair.  
  
"A sword is something a warrior entrusts their life—or something even
more important—to on the battlefield. That's why we, who forge them,
must face them as if staking our lives, and finish them with all our
heart and soul."  
  
And then he sighed and shook his head.  
  
"If you face it with all your might and as a result don't reach
perfection, then it can't be helped. Humans have limits. In fact, no one
can forge a truly perfect swing. However, it's important to do your best
beyond that. It's not about money."  
"I understand that ideal, but we wouldn't be able to make a living,
would we?"  
"We're making a living now, aren't we? There will always be someone who
sees the effort we put into a finished sword. You're just trying to take
the easy way out."  
"That's because you're a comrade-in-arms with the Margrave, and that's
how it started. It's safer for our business to focus on mercenaries like
caravan escorts and forge more good swords than others. It's not
guaranteed that we'll be favored in my generation, is it? The Margrave
might even be transferred."  
  
Now, Bogan Christand had become the general of the northern region.  
Koz was a comrade-in-arms who had shared meals with him under Captain
Gallen.  
Until they gained favor from the nobles under Christand's command
through that connection, their household finances were in dire
straits.  
Due to Koz's meticulousness, they had been impoverished during Kace's
childhood, and he certainly didn't want that for his own generation.  
Of course, he naturally wanted to forge good swords, but even so, Koz
still seemed excessive.  
  
"Isn't it good enough if it's not a bad sword? Blacksmiths in other
towns polish them up and sell them for gold coins, that's the kind of
quality they have."  
"I'm telling you that's not the issue. Why don't you understand?"  
"I've explained it many times, even after understanding it. You can
pursue your ideals, Dad, and that's amazing, and I respect it. It won't
hurt you if I do blacksmithing that earns money. If we have more leeway,
you'll be able to concentrate even more. What's wrong with—?!"  
  
Koz stood up, grabbed Kace by the collar, and roared.  
  
"I'm saying this because I think you can become a craftsman even better
than me!!"  
"..."  
"Don't make excuses like 'it's for Dad,' and forge swords by staking
your life. The swords you finish like this, casually, are swords I only
managed to forge when I was ten years older than you, giving it my all.
You're blessed with talent. That's why I'm saying this, because I
believe you'll definitely be able to forge swords even better than mine
in the future. ...The swords I forge are certainly the best for me. But
ultimately, they are the best *for me*—you can definitely go beyond
that."  
  
His gaze was so intense it felt like it held murderous intent.  
Kace flinched for a moment before looking away, then Koz sighed and let
go.  
  
"...Dad expects too much of me."  
  
Kace muttered, as if spitting it out, and returned to his room.  
He didn't think he lacked talent.  
However, he believed that to go further, one needed a certain kind of
madness.  
He didn't have his father's passion, his obsession, or his
self-discipline.  
Kace, who could compromise, would never be able to surpass Koz, who
never allowed himself any compromise.  
He was the kind of person who could become disheartened like that, and
for several years, nothing changed.  
  
The turning point was the adopted daughter of the Christand family.  
The Great Hero, Alberinea—Krische Christand.  
  
"That child said she would sharpen it herself, but I thought I'd ask you
to do it along with my sword. She’s been unwell after the battle, so I
wanted her to rest and forget about it for a while."  
"I see. But this is..."  
  
His encounter with Her, who would later be called Alberinea, was as the
daughter of the Christand House.  
She visited with Selene and a servant, and his father forged a sword for
self-defense.  
It was a short sword like a savage's machete, emphasizing portability
and ease of maintenance.  
  
About two years passed.  
By the time the memory of his father forging such a sword had faded from
even Kace's mind, it was Selene who visited, carrying her sword.  
There were no chips in the blade, and the curves were smooth.  
The smooth shape was maintained, but only the edge had become rounded.  
It was blunted like a well-used kitchen knife rather than a sword.  
  
"...It's incredible, isn't it?"  
  
There were no major chips, and it was so beautiful.  
There were no noticeable scratches on the surface, yet only the very tip
of the blade had lost its sharpness, as if it had been blunted, and its
luster was unusually dull.  
Although it was visibly heavily used, it didn't seem like it had been
used as a sword on the battlefield.  
  
"...'Incredible' isn't even the right word. She charged almost alone
into the enemy, and that's what happened to it."  
  
She sighed in exasperation.  
Then, with a sad look, she lowered her gaze to the sword.  
  
"I'd like you to clean it up as much as possible. She was worried
because she had used it a bit roughly."  
  
Koz nodded, "Understood," and Selene left, saying, "Please do."  
For a while, his father gazed at Krische Christand's sword.  
  
"Amazing, this is..."  
"It's like a kitchen knife. Not a sword for rough fighting."  
  
Then he handed it to Kace.  
  
"What do you think? Don't you want to forge a sword for someone who
wields a blade like this? A sword into which you pour your entire heart
and soul, your entire life?"  
"Well..."  
  
Kace started to speak, then stopped himself.  
  
"I regret it. I forged it with the intention of it being for
self-defense... Of course, it's not a bad sword, but it's certainly not
a suitable sword for someone of Krische-sama's prowess. If I had made it
harder, it wouldn't have been like this, and there wouldn't even have
been any chips."  
  
Indeed, that was probably true.  
It wasn't chipped; the edge was crushed.  
It was the result of being swung with pinpoint accuracy.  
  
"It's the result of unconsciously compromising, assuming it was just a
self-defense sword. I failed to do my best for someone who wields the
best swords. These chips aren't from Krische-sama; they're chips I
created. ...As a blacksmith, it's the most shameful thing."  
"That's a bit much... just from talking a little, to that extent—"  
"Of course. There's no way to know. But... for example, if someone
casually dropped by one day and ordered a sword, would you be able to
understand how well that person wields a sword?"  
  
Kace frowned and shook his head.  
  
"You don't know the opponent's skill, their talent, anything. But the
person who visited today might be an unimaginable swordsman, or might
become one someday. ...That's why you must always do your best and
deliver the best sword to them. That's the most important mindset."  
  
Koz said, looking at Kace.  
  
"I'm not talking about business with you. I'm talking about a way of
life."  
"...A way of life."  
"You're a full-fledged adult. You can manage anywhere. If you truly want
to master the path of business, wanting to forge for money, I won't
complain. But don't live by inertia."  
  
Saying that, Koz drew Selene's longsword.  
It was slender, yet thick and sturdy.  
Despite countless scratches, it had only one major chip.  
  
"...It's not about age or ability. People who define their own way of
life and move straight forward are as beautiful as elegant steel. When
such a person walks a difficult path, we forge with a prayer that we can
be their support. ...This is that kind of job."  
  
He sheathed the sword and looked at Kace again.  
  
"What we forge is not steel. It's our own soul, hammered into the steel.
With every swing of the hammer, we keep asking if this is good enough,
until our weak hearts disappear... until it is sublimated into a form of
beauty."  
  
His eyes were straight and strong, like a warrior's.  
  
"Only those who walk a difficult and painful path are truly given
something. ...Just once. You too, try to forge one swing without
compromise, just once."  
  
Then he stood up and patted Kace on the shoulder.  
  
"You'll understand if this path is worth spending your one life on. As a
father, I want you to live a fruitful life."  
<br/>  
<br/>  
<br/>  

His father was an artist, he thought.  
He still felt that he was different.  
  
He understood to some extent what his father was saying.  
He had watched his father work since he was born.  
Not for money, nor for honor, his father was a craftsman more sincere
than anyone.  
Sometimes he took on jobs for what could be called a pittance.  
  
Sometimes, he was deeply thanked, and a few years later, asked to work
again, and it wasn't uncommon for payment to be in gold coins.  
But it was a business dealing with weapons.  
Often, those clients never appeared again, and many would give up
halfway, or sometimes even sell the sword without any gratitude.  
  
Precisely because he understood how much effort his father poured into a
single sword, there was an indescribable feeling of helplessness and
indignation.  
Even when sincerity wasn't returned with sincerity, his father said
nothing.  
Whatever Kace said, he would simply dismiss it with a simple: "It's a
sword I sold."  
  
His father's swords were beautiful.  
A swing without compromise was simple in theory, but not easy in
practice.  
The more skill one gained, the more flaws became visible, and leaving
flaws meant compromising.  
The elegance of his father's uniformly hammered steel was truly Koz's
soul itself.  
  
The more he saw people treat it roughly, the more he wondered if it was
worth all that effort.  
Many people didn't understand the value of his father's work.  
They didn't understand, couldn't comprehend, the value of steel
meticulously crafted to suit the opponent's physique, skill, and
purpose.  
  
His father's steel had more value than the dozens of gold coins for a
flashy "masterpiece" that many called beautiful.  
But still, Kace wondered why it was necessary to go to such lengths.  
  
Kace knew how to sell his father's swords for much more.  
His father, of course, also understood.  
If they were decorated, with properly prepared scabbards, and the steel
polished like makeup, the rich would flock to buy them.  
Such discussions had happened many times, and that was probably the true
value of his father's steel.  
  
That was why, even though he thought his father's path was beautiful, he
couldn't take the plunge.  
Kace couldn't accept, like his father, "It's a sword I sold."  
He would, however, if it were to someone who understood its value.  
  
—A little over a year later.  
After the civil war known as the War of Succession ended, Bery, a
servant of the Christand family, Krische, who had obtained the title of
Heavenly Sword, and two female subordinates all arrived.  
  
"...Sorry. Even though Koz-san worked so hard to forge this sword for
Krische... Krische intended to cherish it forever."  
"Oh, no, please don't worry. A sword used this much must be truly happy.
Swords are consumables to begin with; they wear down with use and
sharpening."  
  
As it was a blade, it was only natural for it to wear down with use and
sharpening.  
However, the degree of wear was unimaginable.  
While it might be understandable if it were a kitchen knife used in the
family for generations, this was not the wear pattern of a blade used on
a battlefield.  
The civil war had lasted about half a year. The sword would have broken
before wearing down like that.  
It was a miracle that the sword had maintained its shape.  
  
Considering the now much-thinner blade as much as possible, she must
have handled it like a kitchen knife, cutting meat, avoiding bone, and
certainly not clashing blades.  
  
"To begin with, it was a little too slender for battlefield use. That
was my mistake."  
  
Just as when he had sharpened it before, Koz's words came from the
heart.  
If it had been misused and broken, that would have been unavoidable.  
While it had been hammered to be unbreakable when used correctly, it
naturally had its limits.  
  
However, despite her extraordinary skill, Koz's sword clearly couldn't
keep up.  
That must have been something his father could never forgive.  
  
From that day on, his father swung his hammer as if he had forgotten
about eating and sleeping.  
He was simply so engrossed that no one could even call out to him.  
  
Since he had seen it before, he had tried hammering the same curved
sword several times, experimenting. He ordered iron ore from various
regions, checking the impurities.  
He refined it by hammering the heated iron mass in the furnace,
expelling impurities.  
While simply increasing purity, it wasn't enough to simply be highly
pure.  
The balance of impurities mixed in determined the value of the steel.  
  
And it shouldn't be too soft, nor too hard.  
That exquisite balance was what made a sword a sword.  
Soft ones were less prone to chipping and were durable, but their edges
would dull easily and wear down quickly.  
The curved sword he had forged before was like that.  
  
On the other hand, if it was too hard, it would chip and break easily.  
Simply making a hard blade was something only an amateur would do.  
A blade that wouldn't wear down when cutting flesh, wouldn't dull when
cutting bone, and yet also possessed the tenacity to never break—it was
like standing a spear on its tip.  
A divine balance was required.  
  
And the red-hot steel didn't tell him what state it was in.  
He judged by the nuance of color, the change in sparks, the feel of the
hammer's swing, and the resonance of the sound.  
His father's mind was directed at the steel, so much so that he wouldn't
notice if called.  
In the shadows, sparks flew.  
Like something not human, he swung the hammer mindlessly.  
  
—Even in the midst of that madness, his father was beautiful.  
  
"How is he, Kace? How's Koz doing?"  
"...As you can hear, he's been the same from morning till night."  
  
While looking at the charcoal stock behind the shop, Fasero, the master
of the leather workshop with long, tied-back white hair, called out to
him.  
Some leather products, such as scabbards and fasteners, were
commissioned from his workshop.  
  
"Your old man was diligent, but he's even more so. ...Even more so for
Krische-sama, who became Her Majesty's blade, I suppose."  
"Even so, he's overworking himself. He's getting on in years, and Mom
and I are worried he'll break down."  
"Can't be helped. That's how craftsmen are."  
  
Fasero laughed.  
  
"There are also people like merchants who work for small change, but
they can't be called craftsmen. A craftsman is someone who dedicates
everything to their skill."  
"I've heard that so many times from Dad that I'm sick of it."  
"You hear it that much because you don't understand, don't you?"  
  
Saying that, Fasero sat on a nearby barrel.  
  
"The clothes you're wearing, the barrel I'm sitting on, even your
house—don't you think they're magnificent?"  
"…?"  
"How many people do you think were involved in making them?"  
"Well..."  
  
When Kace hesitated, unable to answer, Fasero said,  
  
"For thousands, tens of thousands of years, various craftsmen have
dedicated their lives to their skills, and we’re supported by them. From
large things to small things, even trivial-looking tools, various
craftsmen must have racked their brains to create them."  
  
Looking up at the sky with distant eyes, Fasero smiled.  
  
"It's because of such people that we can eat and live. That's why
craftsmen work with respect for their predecessors. ...Doing shoddy work
would be like throwing mud in their faces."  
  
"In your case, it might be a little hard to understand," he said,
looking at Kace.  
  
"Closer to home, in my case, it's my master. I fell in love with my
master's work and entered this path. But for you, it's your father...
You don't quite understand the blessing of being shown top-notch work.
Still, how about it, isn't your old man cool?"  
"...Well, of course I respect him."  
  
He respected him more than anyone. He thought he was a true craftsman.  
However, whether he wanted to become like him was a different matter.  
He sometimes thought in his heart that it wasn't necessary to go to such
lengths.  
  
"Your grandfather died young, you see. Koz came back from the war
injured, and he died a few years later. ...Koz regretted not being able
to properly inherit all of his father's craft."  
  
“Human life is short,” Fasero said.  
  
"To advance the craft built by predecessors one step further. That is a
way to repay our predecessors. That itself isn't something that can be
done with ordinary effort, but he probably always swings the hammer,
even for his father who fell halfway through the path. For him, I guess
it's now."  
"Now...?"  
"It's the moment of that repayment. His life amounts to completing this
one swing... He must think so. And he wants to show you that moment."  
  
Fasero stood up and strongly patted Kace's shoulder.  
Then he said,  
  
"If you have time to idle here, watch your old man's work closely. It's
a big job that contains everything he's done so far."  
"...Yes."  
"He's not good with words, so he won't say it, but that one swing is
probably the one he wants to show you more than anyone. ...Stop thinking
about foolish things and watch him closely."  
  
Saying that, he ruffled Kace's head and turned on his heel.  
  
"Tell Koz that the best sword is waiting. It's Krische-sama's sword.
We're all going to respond with our best work too."  
  
That was the trigger.  
Kace, who had stopped lingering in the workshop thinking he would only
be in the way, started spending all his time there.  
His mother smiled wryly, telling him not to worry about the shop, and
his father, without a word, accepted Kace's attempts to help with the
work.  
  
Hard at the edge, yet not too hard overall.  
The dilemma was in the refining process before forging. The aim was not
perfect homogeneity, but a balance of hardness gradients.  
Harder at the edge, gradually softening towards the back.  
A blade hard enough not to dull, yet soft enough to absorb impact.  
And on top of that, it mustn't have any rough spots or irregularities.  
  
And what was troublesome was its shape, unlike a straight sword.  
In the process of creating the "く" shape, it must not be disturbed.  
It could only be finished by luck, using a base created by extremely
meticulous refining, and then by layering rare training and skill to
finish it by luck.  
Such forging was probably beyond human capability.  
  
The beauty of his father, simply becoming one with the hammer,
mindlessly, was probably there.  
To create something that a human couldn't create, he even abandoned
being human.  
His father's silhouette told Kace that his body and mind existed only
for that purpose.  
The flying sparks were impurities—the human being known as Koz the
blacksmith.  
  
However, there were limits, after all.  
His father, engrossed as if he had forgotten eating and sleeping, was
already in his old age, and then,  
  
"D-Dad!"  
  
One day, he collapsed as if he had lost consciousness.  
<br/>  
<br/>  
<br/>  
"He's overworked. ...Honestly, this man."  
"...It’s my fault. I should have forced him to rest more."  
  
His mother, whose face had been pale, now seemed relieved by the
doctor's words and stroked Koz's forehead as he slept in bed.  
She looked at him with a troubled expression, like a child.  
  
"He wouldn't have listened even if you told him, anyway. It's good that
he got a chance to rest by force."  
  
He asked his mother, who smiled wryly.  
  
"Mom... what do you think?"  
"About what?"  
"Dad's work. You never stop him."  
  
His mother thoughtfully shook her increasingly white hair and smiled
softly.  
  
"I married your father because I loved his work, you see. I don't
understand the technical aspects at all, but..."  
  
She said with a troubled expression, gazing at Koz.  
  
"But I think your father's work is incredibly beautiful. He's just so
earnest and sincere... I fell in love with his way of life. My happiness
is to watch and support him by his side, always."  
  
She smiled wryly, saying, "There's nothing to think about."  
  
"Krische-sama, who became the kingdom's greatest hero, specifically came
back to your father for another job. He's truly happy that his work
reached such a person. He doesn't complain like you do, but he's also
been through a lot of hardship and pain."  
  
His mother chuckled at Kace, who was speechless.  
  
"...I'm happy about that too. I can't stop him. Completing this work
perfectly is probably your father's greatest happiness."  
"Mom..."  
"Ah, no, that's not quite right."  
  
His mother looked meaningfully at Kace.  
  
"Perhaps your father's greatest joy is for his beloved apprentice to see
his perfect work."  
  
Then, she asked Kace, "Can you really afford to sit around?"  
  
And so, Kace swung the hammer in the workshop.  
He couldn't do work like his father's, but he could at least help.  
He put the good quality iron ore he got from Arna into the furnace and
hammered out impurities from the red-hot iron mass.  
  
It required not just skill, but a certain amount of luck.  
The ideal was to hammer out only unnecessary impurities, leaving only
what was needed.  
He wouldn't know if the iron ore was a hit until he hammered it. But
with perfect material, his father would surely do perfect work.  
  
Tenacity on one side, and hardness on the other.  
He hammered the iron ore flat like a plate, folded it, and then threw it
aside, saying, "This isn't it."  
What he sought was not his ideal, but his father's ideal. With every
strike, his father's scowling face, with a furrowed brow, flashed in his
mind.  
  
It was a strange feeling.  
He swung the hammer, and sparks flew. He saw the red-hot iron mass.  
The entire world was just that.  
The furnace illuminated the dark world, and dancing sparks shimmered and
scattered.  
  
His arm, swinging the hammer, oblivious to time, seemed to know no
fatigue.  
It descended onto the iron mass as if questioning it, and only the
echoing and sparks responded.  
"Good enough" or "high quality" were words nowhere to be found.  
  
Only "authentic" or "defective"—that was all.  
Whether it was worthy of his father's hammer, or not—that was all.  
He spent all his time blacksmithing, from dawn to dusk.  
He felt even mealtimes were bothersome as he entered the world of
silhouettes.  
  
When he found it, he thought, *the sound is different*.  
The flying sparks, everything, burst exactly as he had hoped.  
A shiver ran down his spine, a sensation akin to a chill.  
He understood that this was what he had been searching for, and he swung
the hammer again and again, making sparks and sounds resonate.  
  
And then, just as he put down the hammer, fully satisfied, savoring the
afterglow—  
  
"Do you want to finish it yourself?"  
"Ah, Dad... were you watching?"  
  
By the entrance of the workshop—Koz stood with his arms crossed, leaning
against the wall.  
  
"...Don't be silly, this is your job, Dad. Even if this were a straight
sword, I can't finish it right now."  
  
Kace stood up, feeling a momentary dizziness.  
Koz instinctively supported him.  
  
"I'm tired. You've rested enough, haven't you? Do your own work."  
"...I see."  
"It should be good enough today that even you can't complain."  
  
Saying that, Kace sat on another chair and drank some water.  
Koz took his place at the anvil and gazed at the extended steel for a
while.  
Without a word, he narrowed his eyes quietly and steadily, then picked
up the hammer.  
  
"...Do you like blacksmithing, Kace?"  
"It's hot and tiring, not a good job."  
"I see."  
  
Koz smiled wryly and said,  
  
"I think so too. I inherited the family business, but there are many
times I think it would have been better if it were an easier job."  
  
"I prefer watching," Kace said, then laughed, "Me too."  
  
"Someday, you too, show it to your own children."  
  
And so, a silhouette of his father swung the hammer.  
Sparks sprung and sounds echoed.  
In a rhythmic dance, like blooming flowers, tiny lights flickered.  
  
Just as Kace was, his father too must have grown up watching such
silhouettes.  
And someday, like his father, Kace too would become a silhouette.  
  
With his father's hammering in his mind, scattering sparks, dissolving
into the scenery.  
  
"...But well, it's not a bad job."  
  
When Kace said that, the silhouette paused its  hammer for just a
moment.  
Laughing, it responded with sparks.  
<br/>  
<br/>  
<br/>  

Beyond a cluttered street lined with many brick
workshops—the blacksmith's sign bore the simplified crest of
Christand.  
A boy, caught trying to go play and ordered by his mother to mind the
shop, lay sullenly on the counter.  
  
When the door opened, he looked up and saw a silver-haired girl.  
She wore a black cloak, and inside, a very elegant one-piece dress.  
She was three or four years older, a remarkably beautiful girl, but he
didn't understand why she would visit such a blacksmith's shop. H tilted
his head, asking what she wanted.  
  
"...? Welcome."  
"Hello. Is Kace-san here?"  
"He's here, but... Grandpa's working with my old man."  
  
Saying that, he gestured behind him.  
The sound of hammers had been echoing endlessly.  
  
"What do you want?"  
"Um, Krische would like you to forge a sword as a gift."  
  
Saying that, she unbuckled her belt, and two swords appeared before the
boy.  
The boy frowned.  
They were oddly shaped barbarian swords, like the ones also displayed in
the shop.  
They were said to be used by the hero Alberinea, and were a somewhat
popular item for self-defense.  
  
One of the swords she showed him, though well-maintained, was quite old,
while the other, from its sheath to everything else, was a very
elaborately crafted piece.  
He was surprised she was carrying two, but their strange combination was
a mystery.  
  
"It's for a child in the dojo, and he seems to want a curved sword
similar to this one for self-defense."  
"We don't forge decorative swords like this here. We refuse even if
offered a lot of money."  
  
When he said that, pointing to the elaborately crafted curved sword, the
girl nodded and pointed to the other sword.  
  
"Ah, yes. This simpler one is fine. Are you his grandson?"  
"Yep. The name's Koz."  
"Koz..."  
"It's my great-grandfather's name. He's the amazing person who forged a
sword for that Alberinea, you know. If you use swords like this, you
must have heard of him, right?"  
"That, yes..."  
  
His great-grandfather was famous for having forged a sword for
Alberinea.  
Being given that name was the boy's secret pride, but his biggest
complaint was that his father and grandfather never told him to help
with blacksmithing.  
Recently, he had been sulking because of that and playing idly
outside.  
  
"But still, they never teach me the work. I hate being just a
shopkeeper. They're working now, and it'll take some time, so why don't
you look at the shelf over there? We have similar swords, and we've been
busy lately, so I don't know if they'll take orders."  
"Is that so..."  
"Well, the ones on that shelf are top-notch, so you can rest assured."  
  
Saying that, the boy went to the back.  
He thought he had forgotten to ask her name, but dismissed it and went
into the workshop.  
  
Opening the door, the first thing he always felt was the heat.  
In the dimly lit room, only the furnace glowed brightly, and a
silhouette swung a hammer.  
A clanging sound echoed, and sparks bloomed and scattered.  
  
The silhouette quietly watching his grandfather's work was his father.  
At times like these, if he called out, the most he'd get would be "Wait
a moment."  
It was a delicate task that looked bold; if he spoke before a break, he
would be scolded.  
  
But he didn't dislike waiting like that.  
Watching the silhouettes and sparks, that unique space, felt like being
lost in a different world.  
The red-hot steel was all there was, and with every echoing hammer
strike, silence spread.  
It was as quiet as if all other sounds had vanished from the world.  
  
Anyone could see that he shouldn't interrupt.  
The precise trajectory of the hammer's swings was indescribably
beautiful.  
  
"A customer, Koz?"  
  
After a moment, his father asked.  
He didn't look at him, but at the red-hot steel.  
  
"Oh, yeah. Some weird noble-looking nee-chan came. She wants a
commission from Grandpa."  
"Name?"  
"I forgot to ask, but she's silver-haired and super beautiful. She wants
a sword like Alberinea's, for a gift."  
  
At those words, the silhouette's hammer stopped.  
Then, after a moment, he stood up and stroked the boy's head with his
rugged hand.  
  
"Koz, for the next job, stay in the workshop and watch carefully from
beginning to end."  
"...Me?"  
"Yes. ...It seems my turn has come."  
  
The silhouette said that with a smile while gazing at the hammer in his
hand.
