## Chapter 339: ※Map of the Area Around Alberan

*AN:*  
*The book version of "The Girl's Unwanted Heroic Tale" is now on
sale!*  
  
*To celebrate the New Year, I'm releasing the in-story map I made.*  
  
*Most of the locations mentioned in the story should be
recognizable...!*  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

・Map (Basic)  
This version omits text information.  
Circles represent major cities, roughly 100,000 people each.  
  
![basic_map](Images/basic_map.png)  
・Map (Battlefields)  
Approximate locations of battlefields.  
Battlefields are grouped together, such as the Hopeless Hunting Grounds
(Hilkintos battle) and "The Maiden's Unwanted Heroic Epic."  
The names are purely personal preference.  
*(TN: It's the names of the chapters where things took place. Sorry for
the lack of artistry on the map.  
1: The Unhinged Girl  
23: Bloody Innocence  
60: A Small Rebellion  
70: The Back of the Back  
102: Storm and Beast  
110: One Who Obstructed  
152: Heavenly Spear and Shield  
187: Heavy Rain  
197: Indigo and Purple  
213: The Flower Blooming Girl  
241: A Maiden's Unwanted Heroic Epic)*

・Map (Cities)  
Approximate locations of cities.  
Most cities appearing in the story are included here.

・About the Alberan Kingdom.  
The scale isn't perfectly accurate, so it's a rough approximation, but
the land area is about 500,000 square kilometers (approximately 600km
long and 800km wide), slightly smaller than modern-day France.  
While the setting is loosely defined, I avoid giving specific numbers,
but considering real-world comparisons, the population is set in the
pre- to mid-Medieval period.  
I vaguely thought it was around 3-4 million people before, but
reconsidering the population and soldier ratio, it feels more natural to
have around 5 million, so that's what I'm currently using.  
There are many forests, so the population is fairly concentrated in
urban areas.  
Thanks to magic, the harvests are good, and it's a relatively prosperous
and relaxed country.  
  
In terms of population:  
Elsren \> Gulshan \> Alberan \> Elderant \> Arna  
In terms of land area:  
Elsren \> Gulshan \> Alberan ≈ Elderant \> Arna  
  
This isn't relevant to the story's entertainment value, but it's just a
general idea! Please use it as a reference.
