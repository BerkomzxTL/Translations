## Chapter 317: Obligation III

The five settlements—the settlements of Kre'Sharana—were quite far apart
from each other.  
One reason was the inability to secure a single large, habitable area,
but a major factor was also the dispersion of potential damage.  
Even Suiko and Ranka were still considered "manageable" as magical
beasts.  
In the depths of these mountains, there were also monsters called
Stormwings, capable of stirring up storms with a single flap of their
wings and annihilating settlements.  
In the past, they were said to have nearly wiped out Kre'Sharana,
despite being protected by such strong warriors. The widespread
dispersion of settlements happened after that.  
Of the seven settlements that existed at the time, two are said to have
been destroyed by them.  
  
The settlements are separated by rugged, monster-infested mountains.  
Because of this, communication between settlements is carried out by
griffins, and human traffic is mostly non-existent, limited primarily to
exchanges among warriors.  
  
The timing was quite bad, as the Warrior Chief, Vinthril, had apparently
been touring each settlement with a griffon, acting as a proxy for Chief
Alkierence.  
  
"It's been a while, Giterns-dono."  
  
It was a night about three weeks after Argoshe's arrival.  
They were seated in a circle in a tent illuminated by magical lamps, and
upon seeing the face that appeared, Argoshe stood up and bowed.  
  
"Vinthril-dono, it's been a while."  
  
A sharp, refined face—long, trained limbs.  
It was Kre'Sharana's Warrior Chief, Vinthril.  
His subordinates, who had been drinking, also straightened up, and Bege,
in particular, practically sprang to attention.  
  
"You're already back..."  
"I heard Giterns-dono had arrived, so I moved my schedule up a bit. I
heard, Bege, that you've been hanging around Giterns-dono's place almost
every day recently, drinking."  
"Not exactly 'hanging around'... maybe once every two or three days."  
"...What good is a warrior like you in such a state? Tomorrow, for the
first time in a while, show me your spear; I'll check if it's dull."  
"Ugh... Understood."  
  
Just moments before, they had been talking about how Vinthril would be
back in another two or three days, and they wanted to get their last
drinks in.  
Seeing him scratch his head like a child caught doing mischief, Argoshe
and the others laughed.  
  
"My apologies, he's skilled but also a heavy drinker, unfortunately.
We've caused you trouble."  
"No, no, Bege-dono has told me many things about Kre'Sharana. It is I
who should be mindful of him... And it was I who invited him to tell me
various stories."  
"Ha... Giterns-dono truly is a man of honor."  
"Not at all... It's the truth."  
  
"How about some wine?" Argoshe offered, and Vinthril gave a wry smile
and nodded.  
Argoshe handed him a cup, poured wine, and they toasted to their
reunion.  
  
For a while, they exchanged drinks and talked about their recent journey
and exploits in battle.  
A little over a year had passed, with the War of the Five Great Nations
in between.  
They hadn't seen each other since Argoshe brought them to the royal
capital.  
He had largely finished greeting other acquaintances besides Bege, and
everyone was friendly.  
Vinthril, too, exchanged words with a constant smile.  
  
"Lira told me. It seems Dukaran was rather impolite. ...Before hearing
his side, I wanted to speak with Giterns-dono first."  
  
After a while, Vinthril broached the topic.  
It was probably his most important business—he was glad that Lira, and
now Vinthril, were so considerate.  
  
"It wasn't so much impoliteness. Knowing the circumstances, it's only
natural... I was aware that there would be those who disapproved of this
exchange. I believe it's unavoidable."  
  
Argoshe smiled, giving the same reply he had given Lira.  
  
"Furthermore, Dukaran-dono is said to be one of Kre'Sharana's most
respected warriors. If I am not recognized by such individuals first,
this exchange will not go well. It wasn't an actual injury, and this is
also part of the exchange... If you can view it patiently."  
"I expected Giterns-donoto say that... I apologize for the trouble. The
problems within the settlement have compounded, making things even more
difficult."  
"Haha, please, don't worry about me at all. If I ever come to you
crying, then I would appreciate your help."  
  
He took a sip of wine and muttered, "It's difficult, isn't it?"  
  
"Everyone wants to improve the future, yet their methodologies differ,
and even their goals diverge. Each time, I wonder what the correct
answer is. I also question how I should manage the territory entrusted
to me... I arrive at conclusions that are neither wholly right nor
wholly wrong, and I repeat these questions and answers daily. That
hasn't changed."  
  
If you bestow favors upon one place, another place that didn't receive
them will suffer.  
It's difficult to balance things well and enrich the territory, yet
monetary wealth doesn't automatically equate to happiness.  
  
"It would be good if everyone was happy in the future. But who is
'everyone'?"  
  
Vinthril straightened his posture slightly, and the others followed
suit.  
They simply gazed at Argoshe, who was looking down at his wine cup.  
  
"...Everyone, you say?"  
"Yes, even though no two people are the same, before you know it, you
start thinking of them as a single entity. I run around my territory,
spending time and interacting, trying to understand someone, even just a
little... and yet, it's hard to say that I truly understand."  
  
He chuckled, "I probably only understand the tip of the iceberg."  
  
"Even as a father, I get lost wondering where my daughter's happiness
lies, thinking this way or that way might be best, and yet all of them
feel both right and wrong. I constantly wander, questioning whether I,
who struggles with even a single person's happiness, truly have the
right to make choices. ...Even as I believe this exchange will benefit
both sides, if asked if it truly will, I have no clear answer to give
right now."  
  
That was probably why he felt no anger towards Dukaran's attitude.  
It seemed beneficial for Alberan.  
However, if asked if a truly happy future for Kre'Sharana lay beyond
that, he couldn't confidently affirm it.  
  
"I've looked at books, invited scholars, and I believe I've gained some
historical, cultural, and academic knowledge. But that's all just
theory; I don't truly understand what makes the people who actually live
in Kre'Sharana laugh, rejoice, get angry, or feel sorrow... I don't
understand anything. If I were to offer superficial words, asking for
their cooperation for the better future of both our nations—this
nation—no one would listen."  
  
He took another sip of wine and continued.  
  
"First, I must learn and understand Kre'Sharana's culture firsthand. If
I can find something that allows us to connect beyond that... for now, I
believe this is simply that period of time."  
  
With that, Argoshe looked up, surveyed the quiet tent, and then glanced
left and right.  
He said in a flustered tone,  
  
"Oh, I'm sorry. I tend to ramble when I drink."  
"No. I, too, am grappling with the same struggles right now. ...And
Giterns-dono, you are my senior—this is truly insightful
conversation."  
"Senior, you say..."  
"The number of people Giterns-dono governs must be quite significant
compared to this entire country. To be guiding them in a positive
direction, that is something to be proud of."  
  
"No, no," Argoshe said, pouring more wine into his cup.  
  
"I am a man of meager talent... I simply bumble around clumsily. I owe
my current state to the many people around me who have helped me. To be
praised so directly by an outstanding person like Vinthril-dono makes me
feel light-headed."  
"Perhaps that's precisely where it lies."  
"…?"  
"It's my bad habit. ...I pride myself on having earned the position of
Warrior Chief through my own strength, and I arrogantly believe I can
guide everyone in the direction I deem correct."  
"That's... not a bad thing considering your position,"  
  
"No," Vinthril said with a wry smile.  
  
"Before Krische-sama, I am like a child. Looking at the world, there are
mighty heroes like Kokys-dono. I should have realized how much of a frog
in a well I was, yet even now, as Warrior Chief, I was thinking of
admonishing Dukaran for his impoliteness, without even hearing him out.
...That would likely have led to a meaningless argument and given
Giterns-dono even more reason to view him as an enemy."  
  
Vinthril took a sip of wine, lowering his gaze.  
Then he looked straight at Argoshe.  
  
"I don't think Giterns-dono is as ordinary as you claim. But I wish to
learn that strength, the strength to laugh at your own lack of talent
like that. As Warrior Chief, I speak grandly to others, but I don't
possess the strength to accept my own smallness."  
  
His eyes held a powerful presence that could make one flinch just by
being directed at them.  
It wasn't an intentional intimidation, but rather, the strong and severe
self-discipline that evoked the rugged mountains of Arbyagel was what
ignited the power in his gaze.  
The old Argoshe would have withered under the intensity of those eyes.  
That he could avoid such a pathetic display now was because he had
become good at pretense, at deflecting—because he could objectively
observe the feeling akin to jealousy, the feeling of being outmatched.  
  
"My 'strength' might be more akin to resignation. Seeing the people of
Kre'Sharana reminds me of my younger brother."  
"Your brother?"  
"Yes. Gifted with talent, strict with himself, noble and kind... He
possessed qualities admirable in a noble, truly my aspiration. However,
he fell in his first battle, dying young."  
  
Argoshe didn't consider himself a diligent worker.  
His younger brother was more dedicated to self-improvement than
Argoshe.  
Where Argoshe learned one thing, his brother learned two.  
Despite being blessed with such talent, he seemed to constantly strive
for more—quickly surpassing Argoshe and moving even further ahead.  
  
Even after it was decided that Argoshe would inherit the family, his
brother never uttered a word of resentment.  
He remembered well how his brother, who respected him and looked up to
him since childhood, would always show a smile, unchanged.  
  
"After inheriting the family and being entrusted with the territory,
whenever I'm troubled, I always think: if my brother were here, he would
surely have done better than me. To make up for that even a little, I
clumsily run around, merely putting on a show to fulfill my
obligation... To be told so directly by someone like Vinthril-dono 
makes me feel a bit ashamed."  
  
For example, if his brother were alive, if he had inherited the family,
if he were here, what then?  
He would not have been scorned by Dukaran; he would have shown a
dignified presence.  
He certainly wouldn't have uttered words like "coward" after seeing his
brother.  
Strength resides in the eyes.  
Just as Alberinea and the Queen possess it, just as the people of
Kre'Sharana possess it, their eyes speak more than anything about what
is genuine and what is fake.  
By eyes that, when directed straight, could make one shrink.  
  
"I, at least, do not see your conduct as a mere pretense or
adornment."  
  
Vinthril smiled.  
  
"Strength is surely not just one thing. If trained skill and physique
are strength, then sincerity like Giterns-dono's and the ability to
possess a broad, calm heart are also strength... Do you truly believe
Krische-sama was the sole impetus for this exchange?"  
"…?"  
"Not everyone who accompanied that journey was convinced. Even if they
thought it was for Krische-sama, the Holy Spirit's ally, not a few were
negative about exchange with Alberan. ...Seeing your consideration and
thoughtfulness towards us, some became enthusiastic about this exchange.
Bege here is one of them."  
  
Bege, who had been addressed, scratched his head.  
Argoshe looked at him in surprise.  
Bege was one of the first among the journey's companions to speak to
him.  
  
"As the Warrior Chief says... rather, most of them weren't thinking
about the exchange with Alberan at all, and the main reasons were
Krische-sama and pure curiosity. From Giterns-dono's perspective, they
were barbarians who suddenly appeared... but to be welcomed so
hospitably changed their view of the lowlanders."  
"...Bege-dono."  
"Well, if you ask if there wasn't a single unpleasant thing about that
journey, that's not true... but that wasn't Giterns-dono's fault either.
Speaking personally, Giterns-dono was the catalyst. If it had been
someone else, it wouldn't have gone like this, and it wouldn't be
surprising if they were complaining like Dukaran's brother right now."  
  
Bege, looking a little embarrassed, drained his wine cup.  
  
"If a person who can change the hearts of those who don't care about
Alberan during a journey isn't respectable, then what kind of person is,
I wonder.  
At least, I think Giterns-dono is a person worthy of respect.  
If Giterns-dono thinks we barbarians just don't have good judgment,
well, that's fine too..."  
"That's not..."  
  
As Argoshe hastily denied it, Bege laughed in a manly way and
continued.  
  
"I like that about Giterns-dono, but I think you could have a bit more
confidence. The current situation is precisely because of
Giterns-dono... it wouldn't go like this with anyone else. At least,
that's what I think."  
"..., Thank you."  
"Besides, the Warrior Chief and Lira-sama seem quite concerned, but
Dukaran's brother is just being stubborn. ...Eventually, when he starts
talking to 'Argoshe Giterns' instead of some unbearable noble from
Alberan, it'll be an easily resolved problem. ...'The beauty of the self
doesn't even reach the Holy Spirit,' you know."  
  
"He's not a bad person either," Bege said, pouring new wine into his
cup.  
Vinthril, though giving him an exasperated look, offered his own cup and
let him pour the wine.  
  
"...You speak too easily."  
"Giterns-dono isn't so small-minded as to worry about such things.
Rather, I think he's the kind of person who worries more about those who
worry too much. Right?"  
  
Argoshe could say nothing, offering only an ambiguous smile.  
Seeing that, Vinthril gave a wry smile.  
  
"I also... thought I knew that Giterns-dono was such a person."  
"No, no. I'm very happy to know your feelings."  
"...No, my apologies. Indeed, it must be difficult given your
position."  
  
Vinthril gazed at his wine cup, deep in thought.  
  
"As Bege said, he's not a bad man. He's strict with himself and others,
and he's respected by many as a warrior among warriors. He's also one of
my respected mentors... but due to past events, he's perhaps a bit too
intense."  
"Past events..."  
"Yes. It might sound like an excuse, but..." 
<br /><br />

  
A month and a half after arriving in Kre'Sharana.  
The water-drinking potatoes had taken root in the field, their vines
spreading around.  
Their growth seemed remarkably fast, probably related to the atmosphere
and the dragon's magical power filling it.  
  
Argoshe and his companions, who had been outsiders, were gradually being
accepted, thanks to Vinthril, Lira, Bege, and others.  
If they met, greetings were exchanged, and they were spoken to.  
Occasionally, opportunities to talk about the kingdom in front of a few
people increased, but even if some expressed a longing for the lowlands,
they likely hesitated to openly ask about it, mindful of the gazes
around them.  
The reactions were often not very good, so the conversations mostly
centered on stories passed down in Alberan.  
  
Old tales, starting with the Maiden of Liberis, were easily accepted and
popular among them.  
Despite centuries of separation, the kingdom also had a culture that
honored warriors, and because they were all human, there were points of
connection.  
He recalled the face of his daughter, who, having never heard such
stories, would look at the bard with sparkling eyes, begging for more
tales and prolonging their stay.  
He used to scold her not to bother him too much, but now he understood
the bard's joy in readily sharing his stories.  
While not bad, Argoshe wasn't particularly skilled at storytelling, yet
there was nothing more joyful than an audience that responded to his
every word.  
  
Of course, not everyone was accepting.  
Sometimes, mischievous children would throw mud balls, and there were
those, young and old, who did not think kindly of lowlanders.  
In a settlement that wasn't very large, he sometimes met Dukaran, but he
was still mostly ignored.  
However, he occasionally felt a gaze from afar, so it wasn't as if there
was absolutely no interest in him.  
  
Whether it was aversion or some other emotion directed at him, it could
eventually turn into goodwill.  
It meant he was being recognized as a fellow human.  
When he traveled around in his younger days, many people saw Argoshe as
a noble and created a barrier between noble and commoner, keeping their
distance.  
  
While he was seen as just one of many nobles, everyone responded
formally and kept their true feelings hidden.  
As this gradually changed from his role as a noble to Argoshe the
person, everyone slowly began to open up.  
If they were directing some emotion towards Argoshe as an individual,
rather than just a noble from the lowlands, it was by no means a bad
thing.  
  
He wasn't planning on doing anything immediately.  
He hoped that this interest would gradually lead to curiosity about
Argoshe himself, and that whether it was aversion or dissatisfaction,
they would eventually engage in conversation and interaction.  
Until then, he would open his heart and wait, simply performing his
duties as usual.  
Without hiding or flinching, in the proper manner of a noble.  
  
Waking up in the morning, he wielded his sword, ate breakfast, and
tended to the fields.  
He made appearances throughout the settlement, learning and noting down
Kre'Sharana's culture and customs, identifying commonalities and
differences.  
Occasionally, he would gather people to tell them about Alberan's
customs and stories, then have dinner.  
At night, he would drink wine or herbal tea with whoever visited his
tent, sleep, and wake up again in the morning to wield his sword—Argoshe
wielded his sword every morning.  
  
In the past, it was an effort, but now it was a habit.  
  
Since he was able to hold a sword, he had diligently trained every day,
excelling compared to many.  
Argoshe was the one who first taught his younger brother the sword.  
Regardless of whether one went to the battlefield or not, a noble must
not neglect their sword training, ready to be a shield for the weak if
need be.  
He would grandly spout words he'd half-heard from Zain's sword master,
who was occasionally invited, teaching sword grip, swings, and
mindset.  
  
It wasn't just the sword.  
To his brother, who looked at him with respectful eyes, saying "Elder
brother," Argoshe taught the way of a noble, something he himself didn't
even fully understand, puffing out his chest with the superiority of
having been born earlier.  
  
A noble, being above the people, must be a fitting presence to be above
the people.  
One who trains mind and body more diligently than others, serves the
King not out of desire, and devotes their entire being to the obligation
of delivering the great King's protection to all weak commoners.  
*Only through the beauty of that way of being are we permitted to call
ourselves nobles*—words from his father, other nobles, and respected
figures, spoken as if they were his own.  
  
His brother listened to and recited the ideal image of a noble that his
brother described every day, and then worked tirelessly to approach that
ideal—when did he start to fear such a brother?  
At some point, Argoshe himself stopped wielding his sword for the sake
of the ideal noble he aimed for, and instead began to wield it to avoid
losing to his brother.  
All his time spent poring over books, everything, was to avoid being
scorned, to avoid being looked down upon by his brother.  
  
After he realized he couldn't win against his brother, he pretended to
be an understanding older brother.  
By praising his brother unreservedly and laughing with admiration, he
tried to show the magnanimity of his own character.   
He certainly loved him.  
But every time they met, a sense of inferiority always seeped into the
depths of his heart.  
It was as if something was gripping Argoshe's heart, making him resent
his brother even as he smiled.  
  
He feared his brother's eyes, eyes that respected him as his older
brother.  
When he was told he would become the head of the family, he was afraid
because he imagined those eyes might one day turn to disappointment.  
What would his brother think, assisting an older brother inferior to
himself as the head of the family?  
He even felt a sense of relief when his brother said he would become a
soldier.  
He thought that if his brother went far away, this feeling would ease.  
  
—He realized it only after losing him.  
It was as if he had lost even the visible signposts.  
At some point, he realized he had been wielding his sword to avoid
losing to his brother, and he was at a loss, having forgotten even why
he wielded his sword.  
  
Remembering his brother's face, who spoke of him as a model noble,
respected him, and recalling the many grandiose words he had imparted to
him, he felt ashamed.  
Since then, he had continued diligently every day.  
He wielded his sword to be the kind of noble he had once described to
his brother.  
  
Not for superiority, not for display, not to protect trivial pride.  
Whether he would wield it in the future or not didn't matter.  
If need be, as a shield for the weak, a noble must not neglect sword
training.  
He wielded his sword so as not to betray the words he had imparted.  
He wielded his sword so he could proudly give the same answer to his
brother, who had lost his life believing those words.  
He wielded his sword so that as an older brother, he could answer, "You
fulfilled your obligation as a noble, for the people."  
  
In the past, it was an effort.  
To be at the top, to not lose, to not be looked down upon.  
A sword wielded as if to escape something.  
  
After realizing, it was a habit.  
Just as one who wakes in the morning awakens their eyes with cold water,
or stretches lightly.  
A sword wielded to be the noble his brother loved.  
  
Not to compete, not to compare, not to strive for greater heights.  
Wielding a sword was simply fitting for a noble's morning.  
That thought alone naturally led him to grasp his sword in the
morning.  
  
"Good morning."  
"Ah, good morning."  
  
In the lowlands, Argoshe woke up around the time the sun was rising or
just before it.  
In this mountainous land, the morning sun was blocked by the mountains,
and the sky was still close to night.  
They would emerge from their tents only after half the sky was
illuminated by sunlight.  
With somewhat sleepy faces, they held their swords and lined up.  
  
They hadn't set any particular rules.  
In the morning, apart from the breakfast duty, they were given freedom
until mealtime.  
In what was likely a stressful environment, he told them to relax, but
at some point, they too began to join the morning practice.  
At first, each did their own thing, and as their numbers grew, they
sought Argoshe's instructions, treating it like training.  
  
"Diagonal cut to horizontal sweep, diagonal cut to upward slash, twenty
each side. Thirty lunging thrusts, thirty reverse-grip thrusts. After
that, as usual, we'll switch to spears."  
"Yes, sir."  
"The first ten times, slowly and carefully, checking your movements.
Now, begin."  
  
As he clapped his hands together, each person began to swing their
sword.  
The important thing was to make it ingrained unconsciously.  
The faster one tried to swing, the more their awareness went only to
their arm.  
If one relied on centrifugal force, the sword could be swung with just
the arm, but with only the arm, the sword couldn't be swung slowly.  
Without using the entire body, one couldn't draw a beautiful sword
flash, nor could they convey weight to the sword.   
Whether one was a magic wielder or not, the basic body mechanics were
the same.  
  
Without any particular commands, each person proceeded quietly.  
Half of them couldn't use magic, and even among those who could, there
were differences in sword proficiency, talent, and magic handling.  
While it might look better to have them swing their swords in unison,
counting "one, two," this method made their individual differences
clearer.  
  
"Troruss, too much tension in your shoulders. The torso is crucial."  
"Yes, sir."  
  
He demonstrated, swinging his sword.  
The diagonal cut to horizontal sweep, the upward slash to thrust,
repeated tens of thousands of times.  
A natural flow of power, stripped of waste, performed slowly.  
  
"An imagined rope extending from your spine—that's your arm. And the
sword is tied to the end of that rope, swung by the movement of your
body. Be that conscious of relaxing your shoulders. Stiff arms impede
the power transmitted to the sword."  
"...Thank you."  
"The arm's role is to guide the power transmitted from your legs and
torso. ...Essentially, think of it like the reins of a horse."  
"Reins..."  
"You make it run, but the horse runs. No matter how much force you put
into the reins to turn right or left, it's meaningless, and you can't
overpower a resisting horse with brute strength. The important thing is
to guide the horse to its destination smoothly... The horse is your
legs, and the power of your torso. Given your skill in horsemanship, you
should understand."  
  
He smiled at Troruss, who nodded, patted his shoulder, and moved on to
the others.  
Teaching others helped his own training.  
Vague understandings deepened by being rephrased into words that could
be conveyed to someone else.  
Many things that he couldn't see when he wielded his sword just to avoid
losing to his brother were now visible.  
  
His brother, surely, had never lost sight of it since childhood.  
He believed his brother had wielded his sword as a noble, not just
recklessly.  
The incredible efforts his brother made were simply habits for him.  
He must have genuinely believed that it was only natural for a noble,
and Argoshe felt utterly ashamed of himself for having been intimidated
by it.  
  
His brother had not wielded his sword for comparison.  
That was why he looked at Argoshe, his older brother, with eyes of
respect.  
  
"…?"  
  
Just as their training was transitioning from sword to spear, the
settlement grew noisy.  
He tilted his head as he saw griffins taking flight, then tilted his
head again.  
  
He strained his ears and heard the faint sound of a bell from far
away.  
And in the western sky—he saw smoke, perhaps a signal fire, rising into
the air.  
  
"…Did something happen?"  
"It seems so. Cax, stop the training and cooking breakfast for now.
Also, prepare all weapons and armor so they can be donned at any
time."  
"Yes, sir! You heard him. For now, we'll make do with fruit for
breakfast."  
  
Had some settlement been attacked—regardless, it wouldn't be immediate,
but in such a land, it was better to be more vigilant than usual.  
  
As he donned the simple gauntlets and breastplate he had brought just in
case, a griffon appeared from the sky.  
Mounted on it was Bege, with a serious expression.  
  
"A report just came in that a Stormwing flew in the west."  
"A Stormwing..."  
  
It was a magical beast akin to a giant eagle.  
Literally, a monstrous bird that could stir up a storm with a single
flap of its wings.  
It was the most feared magical beast in this land.  
Even griffins couldn't approach it, and even thrown spears couldn't
reach it due to the raging storm it created.  
It was a monster among monsters, capable of leveling forests and preying
even on other magical beasts.  
  
"It's an unbeatable monster. We can only hope it doesn't come near us,
close to the Holy Spirit... Either way, the entire mountain range will
be restless for a while. For now, Giterns-dono, please come here; the
chieftains are holding a meeting."  
"Understood. Cax, I'll leave the rest to you."  
"Yes, sir!"  
  
As he spoke, he felt a cold chill down his spine.  
A Stormwing was a terrifying entity in itself.  
Even other magical beasts would turn their backs on a Stormwing.  
The escaping magical beasts would then ravage other territories, which
would cascade throughout the entire mountain range—and of course, one of
those ultimate destinations included the territories of the people
living on this mountain.

Meanwhile, at that time—  
  
"How is it? Today's dessert?"  
"Mmm, it's pretty good..."  
"Fufu, thank you."  
  
Kreschenta sat on Bery's lap, in her nightgown, arms crossed, leaning
back against Bery's ample bosom, moving only her mouth.  
The knife and fork were fully automated—because Kreschenta had just
woken up.  
  
"You really are completely unkempt in the mornings. Even if work starts
at noon, couldn't you at least change your clothes?"  
"Now, now, she seemed quite busy yesterday... she's tired."  
"I am tired..."  
"You spoil her like that..."  
  
Her eyelids fluttered sleepily, stifling a yawn.  
Anne and Elvena chuckled, their shoulders shaking, and Krische, looking
envious, pulled her chair closer.  
  
"Um, Bery, Krische wants, um..."  
"Krische, she's like this because you, her older sister, are so
pampered. Do you understand?"  
"Eh...?"  
"Fufu, don't tease Krische-sama. Krische-sama, here."  
"Ehehe, aah..."  
"You really are..."  
  
Unaware of the distant troubles, the mansion was peaceful today as
well.
