## Chapter 316: Obligation II

The settlement of Kre'Sharana was entirely nestled in the mountains.  
Due to the rugged terrain and the abundance of magical beasts, it was
impossible to secure a single large plot of suitable land for living, so
the settlements were scattered in five main divisions.  
  
At the authoritative apex was the chieftain, who wielded strong power,
but institutionally, it was a council system.  
There was an Elder Council, comprised of previous chieftains and
influential retired warriors.  
For matters concerning Kre'Sharana as a whole, this council would be
convened, and decisions were always to be reached through discussion
there.  
Even if opinions diverged, no voting took place; the chieftain's opinion
generally held precedence.  
However, if the Elder Council disagreed, they could select a new
chieftain candidate, and everything would be decided by a duel between
the new candidate and the current chieftain.  
  
Yet, if the chieftain was merely respected, no one would contemplate
replacing them.  
In practice, there weren't many instances where this was invoked.  
Although opinions were somewhat divided regarding the resumption of
relations this time, it seems Alkierence's opinion ultimately
prevailed.  
  
It was a simple yet effective system.  
While it might pose challenges for a large nation like Alberan, for a
small community like Kre'Sharana, where the relationship between the
people and the authorities was close, it was intuitively easy to
understand.  
Although there was a risk of division due to conflicting opinions, this
system offered even greater stability precisely because Kre'Sharana
emphasized freedom from all desires.  
  
Below the chieftain and elders were the Warrior Chief, the Guardian
Chief, and the Great Warriors.  
Each time a generation passed, twelve selected warriors were called by
this title, with the top among them being the Warrior Chief, and the
next in line serving as the Guardian Chief, the gatekeeper to the path
of the Holy Spirit.  
Bege, who guided him, was one of them, an extraordinary warrior.  
Primarily, they were Gryphon Cavalry—leaders who managed the aerial
warriors, and in times of emergency, they commanded the warriors under
the chieftain and Warrior Chief.  
  
For them, the aerial warriors who rode griffins were objects of respect
and admiration.  
Great Warriors who became Warrior Chiefs or Guardian Chiefs were always
chosen from among the aerial warriors.   
However, beyond that, there seemed to be no other institutional class
distinctions among warriors.  
As long as a warrior possessed the strength defined by Kre'Sharana,
their skill in handling griffins was the selection criterion for aerial
warriors.  
Naturally, there were warriors with superhuman strength who were not
adept at riding, and that was likely the reason.   
Basically, adults seemed to evaluate pure individual strength more than
whether someone was an aerial warrior or not, accepting the differences
as roles.  
  
Below them were the squires—those whose strength was deemed insufficient
for warriors, but their quality and training were incomparable to that
of common soldiers in the kingdom.  
In fact, even squires not recognized as such were individually close in
skill to the children of noble families, born into martial households
and rigorously trained.  
The astonishing demographic ratio where approximately ninety percent of
the population possessed magical power was sufficient to have
Kre'Sharana, a community the size of a small town, recognized as an
independent nation.  
Even among the surrounding great nations, anyone who learned of this
would be forced to acknowledge it as a country with formidable military
power.  
At the very least, considering its geographical factors, it was not
difficult to imagine that a small force of less than two battalions
could easily repel an entire army.  
  
It was also believed among them that the dense magical power emitted by
the Holy Spirit strongly influenced the birthrate of magic-wielders, and
this ratio had reportedly increased year by year.  
In the future, scholars specializing in this should be brought in—at
least in this land, much knowledge unavailable in Alberan could
undoubtedly be gained.  
From an academic perspective, this place was a treasure trove.  
  
Exchange with Kre'Sharana would undoubtedly bring much fruit to the
kingdom, and considering that, his role was indeed important.  
Wielding a hoe and digging the earth, he wiped the sweat from his brow
with a towel.  
  
"There's no need for His Lordship to do such field work..."  
"The more hands, the better. At least in this place, I am the most
ignorant and useless, so I must help with manual labor at least."  
  
He knew that if he acted pretentiously, he wouldn't be accepted.  
Removing his usual cloak, jacket, and shirt, deeming decorations
unnecessary, Argoshe wielded the hoe with his bare upper body exposed.  
Even though it was for planting the potatoes they brought this time, his
escorts often repeated the same sentiment, some with concern, some
exasperated, at the sight of Argoshe—a long-standing noble of the
kingdom, and a Marquis at that—doing such field work.  
  
They knew that Argoshe was never arrogant or pretentious, a noble unlike
other nobles, and they genuinely revered this aspect of their lord.  
However, even they found it somewhat difficult to accept their respected
lord doing manual labor.  
  
"But, my lord..."  
"What, it's a good experience to work under the sun and sweat like this
occasionally... It feels good. More importantly, how is it?"  
"Ah... yes, it was a bit rough, but the soil is good. It's loosened up a
lot, and if it's like this, it will take root and sprout quickly. Shall
we plant it tomorrow?"  
  
Cax replied with a hint of exasperation.  
He was one of those who had served Argoshe for many years as the head of
the escort unit.  
He was shrewd and a top-notch swordsman.  
Recognizing his potential, he was promoted, but he was originally born
into a farming family in the countryside and was very knowledgeable
about soil.  
Here, he was in charge of the field and directing it.  
The other three around him were also from farming villages.  
This time, unlike their usual escort duties, he had specifically
selected and brought a small number of people with particular knowledge
of mountains and fields.  
The remaining escorts were foraging and hunting in the forest.  
  
Argoshe had intended to create a field from scratch, wishing not to
burden them, but Lira advised against it, saying it was too much, so
they were lent one of the abandoned fields.  
It was at the edge of the settlement, far from a water source, and not
known for good yields, but whether it had been worked on before made a
big difference.  
At Cax's strong recommendation, he decided it was not good to be
stubborn and used this place.  
  
"But aside from the water-drinking potatoes... we won't know about the
other potatoes until we plant them. The temperature is more different
from the plains than we expected."  
"This is like a preliminary test... As long as we don't harvest nothing
at all, I'm fine with it."  
  
Water-drinking potatoes—a type of potato called Garish.  
They weren't particularly delicious, but they were called water-drinking
potatoes because they could grow even in barren land as long as there
was water.  
Since they were originally a southern variety, they were said to be weak
to snowy winters, but the winter in Arbyagel was surprisingly warm.  
They were selected after discussions with scholars and farmers, and
several other varieties were also brought, but this was the main one.  
  
"It's hot, though. Perhaps it's the high humidity."  
"Indeed... Before even considering excessive clothing, I can clearly
understand why the people here dress like that."  
  
He had intended to avoid summer and choose the snowmelt season, but this
was truly a summer mountain.  
The wind blowing down was quite pleasant, but when it didn't blow, the
air felt sticky.  
It was tolerable if he stayed still, but when he moved like this, he
sweated so much that his clothes were immediately soaked.   
The main reason why those who initially hesitated to take off their
clothes followed Argoshe's example was this heat.  
  
Especially from the snowmelt plains to here—the temperature difference
was significant.  
It would take a while to get used to it, he thought, as he drained the
water from his leather canteen.  
He then refilled the water in the bucket he had brought and frowned at
the meager amount remaining.  
  
"Keep going for a bit. I'll go fetch water."  
"Oh, if that's the case, I'll—"  
"It's fine, it's fine. Wielding a hoe and fetching water are the same
job. Let's take a break when I get back."  
  
He wanted to say, "You all rest," but they were all good-hearted
people.  
If Argoshe was working, they would continue their tasks, as if to say
they couldn't relax, so a system of "everyone works, everyone rests" had
been established.  
If they had military experience, they would probably obey orders, but
even though their kindness was troublesome, it was also welcome.  
He always thought he had gathered truly good subordinates.  
  
With a sword at his hip, he shouldered a carrying pole—a long staff—and
headed towards the well.  
It was a short walk to the well from here, but not a significant
distance.  
It was in the corner where the artisans gathered.  
He was using the well at the edge of that area, but there were already
over a dozen men there. All but about three were young, likely
apprentices training in the nearby forest.  
  
They were dousing themselves with well water and quenching their
thirst.  
Several noticed him, and a large man, apparently their instructor,
recognized him and approached.  
  
"Are you the man from the lowlands?"  
  
It was the language of Kre'Sharana, close to archaic in the kingdom.  
  
"Yes, it's a pleasure to meet you. I am Argoshe Giterns."  
  
Thanks to diligent study with a teacher since his previous guidance, he
had acquired a certain level of their language.   
Originally, the archaic language was the prototype of the Western common
tongue—though there were some differences, the sentence structure was
similar, and it was not as difficult as, for example, the culture-bound
Shaanese language.  
  
Perhaps he was surprised that Argoshe replied clearly in their
language.  
He raised one eyebrow but smiled.  
  
"I am Dukaran, a warrior. I heard you came from the lowlands and are
plowing fields like a woman... The rumor seems to be true."  
  
The boys behind him snickered.  
He was certainly not being welcomed.  
The intent to mock was clear, but he smiled nonetheless.  
  
"That's right, Dukaran-dono. It might be strange in Kre'Sharana, but
it's common in the lowlands. Please bear with it for a while if it
bothers you."  
  
He hadn't expected to be welcomed as a guest.  
Rather, he had anticipated that there would be people who would adopt
such an attitude.  
He was being received much more favorably than he had imagined, so it
didn't particularly bother him.  
  
The large man, Dukaran, walked closer and stood before Argoshe.  
Argoshe was neither tall nor short, but Dukaran's physique was nearly
seven feet.  
He was powerfully built, with the strong presence characteristic of a
formidable warrior.  
Argoshe had trained himself to some extent, but he was certainly not an
opponent he could defeat in battle.  
Like his height, Dukaran was an opponent he had to look up to.  
Among those Argoshe had seen since coming to the settlement—including
those who had accompanied him on his recent journey—Dukaran was likely
among the top.  
  
His coarse, unkempt hair and untrimmed beard.  
From his deeply chiseled features, his sunken eyes were sharp.  
  
"I thought you would be some softling, but you seem to have trained
yourself to some extent. Are you the leader of the lowland folk who
visited this time?"  
"Yes, if I may be so bold. I have been entrusted by Her Majesty the
Queen with the future exchanges between our two nations, so I hope you
will remember me."  
"Hmph. But a mere name is meaningless. What's important in Kre'Sharana
is a warrior's name. I would very much like to know your skill."  
"!"  
  
He let go of the carrying pole he was shouldering and instinctively
moved backward. Dukaran's drawn scimitar was sharp, sweeping through the
spot where Argoshe had been.  
  
"I'll decide whether to remember your name after that. ...It seems quite
flashy, but is the sword at your hip just for show? Come on, wield
it!"  
"Please forgive me. It is certainly not for show, but neither is it
something to be wielded lightly in such a place."  
"Are you deaf? I told you to wield it. Or are the people of the lowlands
a bunch of cowards who can't even draw their swords, even when so
thoroughly mocked?"  
  
What should he do? He certainly couldn't draw his sword in earnest in a
situation like this.  
It would be utterly preposterous for him, who had repeatedly told his
subordinates to avoid trouble no matter what, to be provoked and draw
his sword.  
The previous flash was merely a provocation, swung because he knew
Argoshe could avoid it.  
  
He wondered what the intention of his words was.  
As Argoshe understood, Dukaran likely gauged Argoshe's skill to some
extent in that brief moment.  
At best, Argoshe would last one clash; at worst, he would lose without
even that.  
Drawing his sword out of pride, knowing he would lose, was an easy
choice.  
  
It was probably true that they didn't look favorably upon this
exchange.  
From Dukaran's perspective, Argoshe was an easy opponent to defeat.  
Was the goal to easily defeat him and mock him?  
Either way, he doubted they would welcome a fool who challenged a losing
battle out of pride with applause.  
  
Fighting or fleeing amounted to the same thing—so drawing his sword here
would only be self-satisfaction.  
A coward who is mocked by an unbeatable opponent and flees, and
self-defense to avoid being called such.  
A battle to tell himself that he faced an unbeatable opponent for
honor.  
  
However, a noble's sword was not meant to protect such pride.  
  
"If I face you, I can fully comprehend your strength, Dukaran-dono. I
would last but a single clash, no more. You must understand this without
even a fight. I see no meaning or reason to do so here."  
  
At least, the Giterns family sword, inherited from distant ancestors,
was not to be drawn for such trivial matters.  
  
"How dull. It truly seems like a gathering of cowards."  
"Everyone is cowardly to some extent. ...However, if you would still be
willing to train me, it would be an invaluable opportunity. I will make
time again."  
"What's the point of teaching a coward? It's a waste of time."  
"—What are you doing!"  
  
He looked up at the resounding voice.  
From the direction of the settlement, a girl mounted on a griffon.  
  
"...Lira-sama."  
  
It was Lira, carrying a basket of fruit, with a stern expression.  
Dukaran clicked his tongue and scratched his head.  
  
"Drawing your sword against a guest in such a place... Dukaran, what is
the meaning of this?"  
"It's the result of my attempt to reach out, in my own way... but it
seems it was worthless."  
"...I understand that you are not satisfied with the exchange with
Alberan. But for a warrior of your caliber to be swayed by temporary
emotions and act in such a way... what do you intend to teach them with
such behavior?"  
  
She approached, riding her griffon, and pointed at the boys behind him
as she spoke.  
Then she dismounted, telling her griffon not to eat the fruit, placed
the basket on the ground, looked at him, and bowed.  
  
"I apologize, Giterns-sama. ...You've seen a shameful display."  
"No. I understand that many do not view this matter favorably. It is not
something for the Priestess to apologize for. Furthermore, Kre'Sharana
values strength... It's only natural for them to want to test me."  
"But..."  
  
Dukaran turned his back and spoke to the boys in Kre'Sharana's
language.  
  
"Hey, let's go. Back to training."  
"Dukaran!"  
  
With his small scimitar slung over his shoulder, he looked at Argoshe.  
  
"What's the point of interacting with such cowards? Kre'Sharana will
only rot... I ask you, please keep them away from the children. If one
rotten apple is mixed in, the whole barrel goes bad."  
  
Lira called his name again, but Dukaran walked away without looking
back.  
While some glanced at Lira with concern, they too eventually followed
Dukaran.  
  
"...I apologize."  
"Please don't worry about it. It was somewhat expected... Past
resentments run deep. I believe it will take decades from now for us to
gradually grow closer."  
"...Yes." 
<br /><br />

  
The man named Dukaran was one of Kre'Sharana's warriors, second only to
the Guardian Chief.  
Although not a griffon rider, he was a respected figure in Kre'Sharana
and was known as a hero who had once hunted an Suiko alone.  
  
"...Even though he is a strict person, he is usually adored... He is not
a bad person. It's just that he has always resisted Kre'Sharana's
current policies, and then, this matter also piled on..."  
"...I see."  
  
He listened while resting, sitting side-by-side in front of the field,
eating the fruit Lira had brought.  
His subordinates also listened intently without speaking, apparently
sensing that there had been trouble.  
  
"There's no need for the Priestess to worry so much. Originally, the
resumption of this exchange was decided and began suddenly, sparked by
Alberinea... It was inevitable."  
  
Dukaran was somewhat of a conservative figure.  
Unlike Alkierence and Vinthril, who held more conciliatory views about
not pursuing those who left and engaging in cultural exchange with Arna,
Dukaran prioritized protecting the ancient traditions of Kre'Sharana.  
  
Kre'Sharana's strict rules.  
It was said that not a few people already longed for the lowlands and
fled from the mountains to the plains through their interaction with the
flatland nation of Arna.  
Especially in Kre'Sharana, where being a warrior was highly
valued—individuals who could not even become squires due to mental
reasons, rather than injury, illness, or physical reasons, were treated
as cowards in the settlement for their entire lives.   
Although it was said that this had softened considerably now, it
certainly could not be called a good life.  
  
Those who left had reasons for leaving their homeland.  
Alkierence believed that eliminating these reasons was necessary for the
survival of the settlement and wanted to give more opportunities to
those who could not become attendants.  
People grow.  
If they understood their own cowardice and wished to retrain their
bodies and minds to challenge the trials again, their resolve should be
honored and accepted.  
  
However, conservatives like Dukaran objected to this.  
They believed that value lay in a single opportunity in life, and that
this was true for actual combat as well.  
The essence of the trial was to pass through a simulated life-or-death
situation, and granting a second opportunity would distort that resolve,
giving them the mental leeway to think they could just try again next
time.  
Could a warrior who passed the trial with such ambiguous resolve truly
be called a warrior—could one entrust their back to them in a
life-or-death situation?  
Even if the settlement were to survive for a thousand years by such
means, would it still be Kre'Sharana, or another country? That was the
question they posed.  
  
Both arguments were understandable, and while such discussions had been
ongoing, Alberinea arrived.  
And spurred by that, the resumption of exchanges was decided.  
It was no wonder the rift deepened.  
  
"If Alberinea were here, perhaps she could solve it by some unexpected
means..."  
"That's... fufu, perhaps so."  
  
Lira shook her shoulders and gave a wry smile.  
She was like a storm that swept up everyone around her.  
Though she herself was utterly calm and child-like, she befriended
dragons, resolved centuries of estrangement, and easily defeated
invasions from three great nations.  
She didn't even need to don the armor she maintained for emergencies;
the recent turmoil was a distant past—a peaceful atmosphere flowed as if
nothing had happened.  
  
If it were her here instead of himself, perhaps her unreasonable nature
would have easily resolved everything.  
At the very least, no one would complain to Alberinea, and few would
even think of complaining to her.  
Everyone would realize that if she tilted her head with a curious,
bewildered expression, her childish logic would undeniably counter adult
reasoning.  
  
If one desires something, one should challenge a dragon.  
Ancient resentments cleared with a single declaration, "It's good to
make up."  
If they attack, just defeat them—she was such an unreasonable being.  
Everyone around her would be swept up, and yet she would resolve
everything, or so he thought.  
  
"Haha, but that's asking for the impossible, isn't it? However, this is
probably the right way. If we rely completely on Alberinea, we might
never be able to interact except through her... The fact that a path has
been forged is more than enough. ...Please don't worry, I intend to
dedicate the next few decades to the well-being of both our nations."  
"Giterns-sama..."  
"There might be similar problems in the future, but please don't let
them trouble you. In a future where our two nations can join hands, such
problems will surely become but small, funny anecdotes of the past."  
  
Lira gazed at him intently, then smiled and nodded.  
  
"Thank you. To hear you say that truly... I wish I could be someone who
commands as much respect as Her Majesty the Queen, but I still lack the
power..."  
"What are you saying? Priestess, you are more than capable... Just now,
I was helped thanks to you. Rather, aren't we burdening you considerably
with our presence?"  
"No, not at all. When there are no rituals, I usually just take care of
these children or help with other tasks... In fact, I often have the
least to do in the settlement."  
  
As she spoke, Lira took a fruit and offered it to the griffon behind
her.  
The griffon chirped with its distinctive high-pitched cry, crushed the
fruit, and happily swallowed it.  
  
"Speaking of which... are griffons cared for by women?"  
"Yes. Women often care for them until they reach a certain size.
Warriors tend to be too strict with their training. Young griffons are
especially clingy, and if they don't get enough attention or are treated
too harshly, they quickly get upset..."  
  
She chuckled as she tickled the griffon's neck.  
The griffon rested its chin on Lira's shoulder affectionately and
chirped, "Kyu-kururu."  
  
"Warriors actually ride them once they can understand words to some
extent and grow larger. After a mount is chosen, warriors usually stay
at the breeding ground for about half a year, living with the griffon.
It might take a month, or nearly a year... of course, there's quite a
bit of individual difference."  
"I see, it seems much more difficult than with horses..."  
"Indeed. As they grow older, they also tend to become more
temperamental... and on top of that, you have to train them strictly, so
it's quite challenging. Sometimes they get angry and cause serious
injuries."  
  
Lira recalled, "My brother even broke his arm once."  
  
"The Warrior Chief too?"  
"Yes. The griffon he's riding now, Ritgund, was apparently especially
wild... He was reportedly kicked. I was just a small child then, but I
remember him smiling at me, who was worried. He said that if he could
ride that one, nothing would be more reassuring."  
  
She smiled, nuzzling the griffon's cheek.  
  
"Because they are partners with whom you entrust your life, you must
face them with all your heart and soul, understand and acknowledge each
other. A griffon rider is someone who exchanges emotions and souls with
their beloved mount. That's what they say... it resonates with many
things."  
"Yes. ...That is precisely the case right now."  
  
He nodded and stood up.  
  
"I am fully prepared to break an arm or two. Right now, we are each
other's griffons... Thinking of what happened earlier as a step toward
understanding each other, it's not a big deal."  
  
He called out to his subordinates, "Let's continue," then smiled at Lira
and extended his right hand.  
She grasped it and stood up.  
  
"I'm afraid I might cause you some trouble for a while, Priestess..."  
"No, the pleasure is all mine. ...Fufu, I understand well why Her
Majesty the Queen specifically chose Giterns-sama."  
"…?"  
"I'm sure she thought, 'Giterns-sama can be trusted,' and felt at
ease."  
"Haha... that's rather difficult for me to answer."  
  
He had been entrusted entirely with diplomatic relations with
Kre'Sharana from the window of foreign affairs—how did the Queen truly
regard him?  
He wanted to believe it was a sign that she didn't dislike him, that he
was at least somewhat trusted, but it wouldn't be surprising if the
reason was simply that his territory was close to Kre'Sharana.  
Or perhaps she had very deep considerations—she was Alberinea's younger
sister, after all.  
At the very least, understanding her inner thoughts was difficult for
Argoshe.  
  
Lira shook her head, smiled, and then bowed deeply.  
  
"Please continue to favor us with your presence, Giterns-sama."  
"Yes, likewise. ...For the future of both our nations." 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
On the day of depature for Kre'Sharana—That night, in the mansion's
bathroom in the royal capital.  
  
"How is it, Kreschenta-sama?"  
"Mmm... it's not bad..."  
  
With Krische on her right and Kreschenta on her left, the red-haired
servant soaking in the bath smiled wryly at the two languidly
relaxing.  
Then, as if an idea struck her, she asked,  
  
"What do you intend to do about Kre'Sharana?"  
"Hmph... they seem dumber than I imagined. I'll just humor them
appropriately, and if I can eventually get griffins and magic crystals
out of them, that'll be enough, I suppose."  
"That's rather rude. Aren't they respectable people?"  
"Talking to them gives me a headache. Are their heads filled with
muscles...? I feel like I lost out by taking them seriously."  
  
"Well, whatever," Kreschenta said listlessly.  
  
"It seems Marquis Giterns likes them. And it's close by, so once things
settle down, it seems fine to just leave it to him. He looks like a
good-natured person, and he'd be perfect for the people of Kre'Sharana,
who don't have a single 'n' of negotiation in them."  
"Fufu, his aura was similar to Anne-sama's. He seemed like a kind
person."  
"It would be troubling if he's similar to Anne-sama in odd ways, though.
Well, at worst, even if they get angry, they'll just retreat into that
lizard mountain anyway, so it doesn't really matter. If I flatter them
appropriately, they'll probably try hard and manage it well
eventually... my shoulder."  
  
As instructed, Bery massaged her shoulder with one hand.  
It was a soft shoulder with no hint of stiffness, but Kreschenta often
enjoyed massages.  
  
"Don't call them lizards. You shouldn't speak that way."  
"That's right, Kreschenta. Regalave-san is a bit different even if he
looks like a lizard. He has big, flapping wings, and his neck is very
long."  
"Krische-sama, that's not..."  
"…?"  
"N-no..."  
  
Bery gave a wry smile, saying "It's nothing."  
Kreschenta blinked her sleepy eyelids, let out a small yawn, and glared
at Bery.  
  
"More importantly, I'm very tired today because of that. You wouldn't
understand, but diplomatic work is very demanding. During your stay,
it's your duty as a servant, more than ever, to ensure I can rest."  
"Of course. I will do my best to help you with your hard work."  
"Good, you understand..."  
  
Dozing, dozing off, in the comfortable bath.  
Thus, he would never know that the exchange with Kre'Sharana had been
entirely left to Argoshe Giterns.
