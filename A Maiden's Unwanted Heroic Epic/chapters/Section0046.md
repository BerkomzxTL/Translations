## Chapter 356: The Mad Rabbit's Twirl-Slash – Middle

A small house and lot in the castle town.  
It had a small garden and a stable, and many similarly constructed
buildings surrounded it.  
  
Boji and the veteran soldier, Taruta Baurlzon, stood in the garden,
practicing with wooden swords.  
Taruta, with his considerably taller stature and slender limbs, towered
over Boji, who was relatively tall.  
His white hair and beard, while showing signs of age, revealed a body
like old wood beneath his clothes, hinting at the strength of a seasoned
soldier hardened by years of training.  
  
His lover, Sarani, with her black hair tied back, anxiously watched from
the side, and Boji nodded.  
  
“You’re Boji, right?”  
“Yes.”  
“It’s been barely two months… and you think you can beat me?”  
“I won’t disappoint you, sir.”  
  
Boji said this with a direct gaze, and the old soldier nodded.  
  
“Very well. Are you prepared?”  
“Prepared?”  
“There are no second chances in this match. If you make a fool of
yourself again like last time, swear you’ll never see Sarani again.”  
“Grandpa, don’t…”  
“Be quiet.”  
  
Then, he thrust his wooden sword forward.  
Boji was speechless, causing Taruta to laugh.  
  
“Your answer? You can turn back now, if you want.”  
  
Considering the meaning of those words, Boji closed his eyes.  
  
“…Understood. I swear it.”  
  
Upon hearing this straightforward answer, Taruta quietly closed his eyes
and resumed his stance.  
  
“I’ll let you have the first move. Come at me anytime.”  
“Yes.”  
  
Sarani held her breath, and Boji regulated his breathing, deeply,
slowly, and quietly—calming his rapidly beating heart like a tolling
bell.  
  
In the swordsmanship dojo, the most important lesson wasn't
swordsmanship itself, but the mental preparation:  
to engage calmly, as if in practice, even in real combat.  
  
He shrugged his shoulders, relaxing the tension.  
He lowered his center of gravity to his firmly planted feet, then
relaxed, centering it.  
His weight wasn’t on his chest or waist, but just above and below his
navel.  
  
The first thing to adjust was his posture.  
A steady abdomen stops trembling.  
When the trembling stops, the heart calms.  
A calm heart broadens the vision, and shallow breaths deepen.  
  
The old soldier before him was skilled with a sword, but not as skilled
as Kalua or Alberinea.  
Thinking about facing them made this much easier. He knew he could at
least make a move.  
  
Five ken separated them.  
It was a bit too far for Boji to attack, but within striking distance
for the old man.  
However, since he’d been given the first move, Boji would choose the
distance.  
  
“…?”  
  
Disengaging his stance, Boji casually closed the distance, moving like
he was walking.  
The old soldier, momentarily confused, stopped his unconscious reaction
to attack, and within that moment Boji had closed the gap by two steps,
to one ken.  
  
From four ken, his sword could reach, even bridging the gap in skill.  
  
“Hah!”  
“G…!”  
  
Boji lowered his posture, taking a powerful step forward.  
A sweeping strike from the right—a deep, heavy blow that couldn't be
avoided with just body movement.  
The old man leaped backward.  
  
Instead of landing next to his right side, Boji kicked off, moving
behind the veteran.  
A true battlefield warrior; the old soldier's jump was small, minimizing
his exposure to Boji's sword, but it allowed Boji to get behind him.  
  
*‘Kurukuru shutto, tontaddon.’*  
  
Alberinea's strange onomatopoeia, which had echoed in his head day and
night, flowed into his mind as he easily circled behind the old man,
crouching low and springing up to deliver a powerful thrust.  
  
It hit—  
  
“Ugh, g…?!”  
  
Just as he thought that, a blow to the stomach.  
A sharp pain, along with risiing stomach acid, caused him to collapse
and crouch.  
  
He saw that the old soldier held his wooden sword reversed.  
Without turning around, the tip, thrust backward, had dug into Boji’s
solar plexus.  
  
“Boji!!”  
  
Sarani, screaming, rushed over and held Boji's shoulder.  
Unable to react, as Boji crouched, the old soldier turned around.  
  
“…That was Alberinea’s style of swordsmanship.”  
  
Then, he smiled quietly, as if he had seen something familiar.  
  
Then, they were led into the mansion’s drawing-room and seated on a
sofa.  
The old soldier—Taruta himself—poured alcohol into cups and placed them
before Boji and himself.  
  
“Do you drink?”  
“Yes, sir. I’ve calmed down quite a bit…”  
  
The pain in his stomach was indeed subsiding.  
  
He nodded generously and raised his cup, to which Boji responded.  
After taking a sip, he spoke to Sarani.  
  
“…This is a day to celebrate. Let’s have a good dinner.”  
“Yes… sir.”  
  
Sarani smiled relievedly and looked at Boji.  
Boji also smiled and nodded, and she went out to do some shopping.  
  
“Well…”  
“I wouldn't call that masterful swordsmanship. It was still clumsy and
lacked sharpness.”  
“Yes.”  
“But it was a sword wielded to win. You made maximum use of the
advantage of being given the first move, boldly closing the distance to
deliver a decisive blow… This wasn’t a sword for honor or show, but a
sword truly for achieving victory. It seems you're receiving excellent
training at that dojo.”  
  
Boji bowed his head, relieved.  
If given the first move, he'd been told to close the distance boldly.  
He had wondered if that was cowardly, but…  
  
*‘Fools die young. You know, the moment you're given the first move,
you've already lost control. If a lesser swordsman attacks
straightforwardly, don’t you think you could easily defend against
it?’*  
  
When it was explained that way, Boji understood.  
It was like being forced to attack an opponent who is ready to defend.  
The side that moves doesn’t always hold the initiative.  
In fact, the side that moves as instructed might be dancing to the
waiting side’s tune.  
  
*‘Usa-chan’s basic principle is to always maintain the initiative. If
you’re as skilled as Usa-chan, it’s a different story, but even the
secret technique, Kurukuru Shutto, is essentially about maintaining
control. First, you need to regain control before attacking.’*  
  
Use everything at your disposal.  
Throw anything that's on the ground; use the sand if necessary.  
Even fleeing to your comrades is a strategy.  
  
The dojo taught him that mindset.  
  
Children usually wield swords because they want to look cool.  
Even now, he sought that form, naturally pursuing a fair fight.  
However, the dojo always taught him not just how to fight, but how to
win.  
He was surprised to be praised for his underhanded closing of the
distance, but he also understood it was the way of a soldier.  
  
He was young and considered himself relatively talented.  
Compared to several instructors of the Black Flag Special Unit, he was
probably better with a sword.  
But if it came down to a life-or-death struggle, Boji was probably the
one who would die.  
That was the difference between a soldier and a swordsman.  
The difference between someone whose life is based on exchanging blows
and someone who isn’t, is vast.  
  
“Peace has come. I suppose it’s wonderful… but in times of peace, there
are always things that are lost. Do you understand?”  
“…Preparedness?”  
“Yes. You are a fine young man. You’re immature, but you made up your
mind, and for what you must protect, you challenged an opponent you
couldn't beat, with the intention to win… I could entrust Sarani to
you.”  
  
He said this quietly, and tilted his cup. Boji looked away and spoke.  
  
“…I was far from your level.”  
“Nonsense. That reverse-grip strike… that was a fifty-fifty chance. If
you were even a little calmer, you could have blocked it, or even if you
hadn’t, you would have had a fifty-fifty chance of blocking it. The
moment you forced a winless fight into a fifty-fifty situation, you'd
won. At the very least, you did your best, and I acknowledge that.”  
  
Taruta laughed and continued, mentioning it wasn’t a life-or-death
fight.  
  
“You have a future. If you’re dissatisfied, keep training relentlessly.
Don't forget that determination… if danger threatens Sarani in the
future, you'll be able to protect her… unlike me.”  
  
Then, he lowered his eyes self-deprecatingly.  
  
“I, too, came from a peasant family. My hometown village was burned down
by bandits, which is why I aspired to be a soldier. To prevent such
lawless individuals from burning down villages again…to be able to
protect what I should protect…I wanted to be that kind of person.”  
  
Hearing those words, Boji gasped.  
  
*‘…If my memory serves me right, I think Commander Baurlzon was the one
punished by Krische-sama.’*  
  
He recalled Mia’s words and shifted his gaze.  
  
“I still can’t forget it. The time I was stuffed into a barrel by my
mother, forced to silence my cries. The screams echoed all night; among
them was my mother's voice. …I couldn't do anything, just crying
silently in the barrel, trembling with fear… it was two days after it
was all over that I was finally taken out.”  
  
He was remembering.  
The fingers pressing against his temple trembled.  
  
“…I wondered if people were capable of such things to one another. Human
malice is unfathomable. Even after weeping and screaming, my mother's
suffering didn't disappear, and her life wouldn't return… I wielded my
sword day and night for revenge, and joined the army. But…I was a coward
who hid in the barrel while my mother was being violated.”  
  
He sighed and looked up.  
  
“Are you familiar with the Royal Succession War?”  
“Yes, sir. I’ve heard about that many times…”  
  
“That was in my mid-twenties. Opposite to your masters… I was on the
side of His Royal Highness, the King’s younger brother. At the Dragon’s
Maw, we were in the position of pointing our swords at Her Majesty the
Queen… and that’s where I saw Alberinea’s swordsmanship.”  
“…”  
“As you can see, I’m still alive… I’m a coward… all the brave warriors
who fought were killed. …That's the kind of swordsmanship she has.”  
  
He confessed to himself that the experience was something he learned the
hard way. 
<br /><br />

  
His village was burned down, leading him to dedicate his life to
revenge, but some time later, he learned that the bandits who attacked
his village had been captured and executed by the military.  
Having lost his target for revenge, he pondered what to do next,
deciding to prevent more people from becoming like them.  
Luckily, he was tall, so he lied about his age and joined the army at
fourteen.  
Despite being beaten by his instructors, he repeatedly insisted on going
into battle, and at fifteen, he was assigned to a permanent Century
whose primary duty was maintaining order and suppressing bandits.  
  
Only a handful of people could become professional soldiers.  
No one had the resources to permanently employ tens of thousands, so
generally only centurions and above were treated as professional
soldiers; the military budget provided by the King was calculated
accordingly.  
Below that rank, soldiers were typically considered reserve troops,
mobilized and organized in times of war; but the warrior nobility
believed that those entrusted with national defense should not take
their responsibilities lightly.  
It was common to use their own funds to permanently employ soldiers up
to the rank of sergeant; in some cases, such as the Christand Army, all
personnel up to corporal were permanently employed. In addition, some
employed soldiers as private troops.  
  
Taruta was assigned to one such permanent Century.  
It was a brave unit employed and commanded by the spear-wielding hero,
Bolzo Belsen.  
As a professional soldier, much was demanded of him.  
Except for Taruta, everyone had been there for at least ten years, all
seasoned veterans.  
  
When he was first assigned, he was quite spoiled and they thought,
“What’s this kid doing here?”  
Likely, assigning him to that unit was a whim and kindness intended to
teach Taruta, who was all talk, a lesson in reality.  
They likely intended to make him give up, thinking he was incapable, but
he stubbornly persevered, and after engaging in several bandit
suppression missions, Taruta was accepted as one of them.  
  
*‘Even if you’re the last one left, fight on as a dead man.’*  
  
He was repeatedly told this within the unit.  
Unlike other Centuries, this one should never flee.  
He was taught to dedicate himself to the unit and to what he should
protect, even at the cost of his life.  
  
Of course, there were many ruffians, and many greedy and vulgar
people.  
It wasn’t that all of them were kind, but it was certainly true that
they were a gathering of brave warriors who dedicated their lives to
their principles.  
Even those who were fighting the night before would help each other and
give their lives on the battlefield.  
Their bonds were as strong as those of brothers and sisters, and they
considered the unit to be their family.  
  
As the youngest member of the unit, as he spent time with them, Taruta
came to deeply respect them as fathers and brothers, and it was around
that time that the Royal Succession War began.  
A war among the royals.  
He didn’t know which side was right, and even if one side was right, he
wouldn’t have left the unit to take sides.  
The unit was the new family he had found, what he had to protect above
all else.  
  
Some time later, the commander was placed under the command of General
Wiring in the central army for the Battle of Bernaich.  
After winning that battle, he took command of reinforcing the
mountaintop fort.  
Of course, Taruta and the others were there as guards.  
  
He didn't think they were particularly complacent or lax.  
Despite the victory, the Wiring army suffered many casualties in the
pursuit.  
They had to protect the engineers, and they were fully vigilant against
ambushes.  
  
The engineers were soldiers in name, but they mostly comprised
carpenters and craftsmen.  
Of course, they had learned how to use swords and spears, but their main
job was construction and related wood processing, making them
practically amateurs in battle, and therefore unreliable.  
Even with proper training, developing the mentality of fighting to the
death isn’t easy, and even less so if the training is perfunctory.  
Rather than allies, they were more like those who needed protection.  
  
Those kinds of battles, where you must protect something, are
difficult.  
In a simple battle, the extreme case is just protecting oneself.  
Killing the opponent in order to not be killed is simple; there’s no
need to hesitate.  
  
Protecting comrades is fine too.  
Comrades who eat at the same table, family.  
If that’s the case, the body would naturally move without hesitation.  
  
However, having to protect complete strangers creates hesitation.  
Even if it is a place, not a person.  
You may understand its importance logically, but doubt may arise in your
heart.  
  
*‘Is it truly something I should protect, even at the cost of my own
life?’*  
  
That kind of doubt.  
And the moment doubt arises, the soldier changes from an organizational
component to just a person.  
  
“This isn’t like hunting bandits. The opponent is the Christand army.
Although defeated, they haven't collapsed, and if they appear, they’ll
be like death itself—attacking with a surprise attack at the cost of
their lives.”  
“Yes.”  
“Even a small hesitation could cause you to be completely overwhelmed.
Don’t think about unnecessary things like protecting the engineers or
guarding the commander. Protect yourself, that’s all you need to do for
now.”  
  
As dusk approached and the campfire began to illuminate the night, the
squad leader of that time said that.  
A young man who was inexperienced in battles despite his experience
hunting bandits.  
It was probably out of concern for Taruta.  
  
He knew how powerful the Christand Army was.  
The near annihilation of an entire army corps in the pursuit was not
normal.  
The extraordinary swordsmanship of Krische Christand, who had served as
the rear guard in the retreat, was also known to them, and some had even
gone mad from the horrific carnage of the pursuit.  
  
The Christand Army was not just a collection of defeated remnants.  
Only a few were arrogant in their certain victory, most were still
wary.  
  
The reason why Bolzo Belsen, who had won his commander position through
his skills and not his lineage, was placed in Bernaich was likely
because General Wiring had the same wariness.  
A skilled spearman with vast combat experience, with no room for
complacency.  
They had thoroughly scouted the surroundings and had set up more than
enough sentries.  
After giving a brief order, he slept during the day and woke up after
sunset, coming out to check on the sentries himself.  
  
He was a wonderful warrior without any arrogance.  
A kind person who would pat a soldier’s shoulder while laughing.  
Of course, to Taruta, a simple soldier, he was someone on a different
level, but he had never heard any bad rumors about him.  
  
He remembered that day well.  
It was probably when he was heading toward his comrade’s tent to inform
them of the sentry change time.  
A scream echoed from the east of the mountain.  
Then came the shouts of enemy attack, followed shortly after by the
sound of a bell.  
  
There was no warning from the patrol; it was a sudden surprise attack.  
Taruta, who initially froze, immediately ran towards the tents. The
sleeping soldiers quickly jumped up, grabbed their swords, and
assembled.  
  
"Taruta, get the others to the commander!"  
"Y-Yes!"  
  
Ignoring the fact that he wasn't even wearing armor, the centurion
captain ran back the way he came, calling out to the squad leaders, then
returned to his own squad.  
The area around the fort was only about half a ri.  
He met up with the squad leaders on the west side and returned to the
center in a very short time.  
  
However, the enemy, who had attacked from the east, had already cut
their way to the center.  
It was an unbelievable sight.  
Only one figure was visible—Krische Christand.  
Her silver hair fluttered as she danced, mowing down soldiers.  
Though they were Taruta's comrades, she effortlessly killed men who
would have been impossible for Taruta to defeat, killing them with a
single strike.  
  
Taruta froze, as did the squad leaders, it seemed.  
Confused by the absence of the soldiers she was supposed to be leading,
they were bewildered when screams and the sound of bells came from the
south side of the fort.  
Leaping over the fence, her Century charged. They instantly killed and
threw down soldiers on the watchtowers, wiping out the nearby
sentries.  
  
Though their numbers shouldn't have been large, the darkness amplified
the fear.  
Throwing burning torches from the wooden bonfires onto the tents and
supplies, their astonishing speed made them seem far more numerous than
a mere hundred men.  
At the time, it seemed to Taruta as though many times that number were
ambushing them.  
It was only later that he learned it had been a surprise attack by
Krische Christand with only a single Century.  
  
She single-handedly created a diversion against an entire army to
distract them, and then launched a flanking attack with her Century.  
Even witnessing it, common sense refused to accept what was happening.  
Only the commander and the major commanding officers on top of the fort
likely had a grasp of the situation.  
  
"So, you are Krische Christand! Your surprise attack was masterful, even
for an enemy… I, Bolzo Belsen, will be your opponent!"  
  
Turning at the sound of the voice, he saw Commander Bolzo Belsen
descending from the fort.  
  
Many voices and orders echoed around him, but they sounded distant to
Taruta.  
The other soldiers were similarly frozen; most were standing still.  
Realizing that his voice wouldn't reach them amidst the chaos and that
he couldn't control his troops, he decided that he should first draw
attention to himself by engaging her.  
  
The closer one gets to someone of higher skill, the better one can
understand the difference in ability.  
The commander, known for his spear skills, had witnessed her abilities
from atop the fort; he couldn't have been acting rashly.  
  
Nevertheless, he descended before her to draw the attention of others
and to be able to use his spear to its full potential.  
They had overwhelming numbers.  
Even if they couldn't defeat her, stopping her movements would lead to
victory once the confusion subsided.  
To calmly buy time, the commander took the best course of action.  
  
After killing three people around her, she responded not with words but
with action.  
  
She moved with a low posture, almost crawling on the ground.  
She unleashed a sweeping strike to the right.  
Ignoring the reach of the spear, she entered inside its range.  
  
The commander, realizing this instantly, leaped backward.  
However, she quickly turned around, circling him to get behind him.  
The commander's skill was as rumored.  
The instant he realized he was at a disadvantage, he tried to stab her
in the back with the butt of his spear, but she easily slipped under his
arm, slicing him open as she twisted her body, delivering a swift strike
to his neck. A moment later, blood spurted, and the commander's body
collapsed.  
  
—If a hundred men were there, a hundred would die; that was a demonic
sword. 
<br /><br />

  
"That…"  
"The sword you used earlier. Did you learn it from Alberinea?"  
"……Yes."  
  
As he answered, the old soldier nodded while sipping his wine.  
Alberinea had used the killing blow in battle—though she called it a
frivolous name like "kururushutto"—but from the perspective of those on
the receiving end, it would not have seemed frivolous at all.  
  
"A terrifying, bone-chilling… beautiful death dance. I still remember it
vividly. Otherwise, you would have won that earlier fight. After all
these years, I think I understand Commander Bolzo's feelings."  
  
He chuckled wryly and continued.  
  
"Of course, it was a hastily learned technique… Alberinea wouldn't have
done it like that. However, it was undoubtedly a good sword technique. A
sword of determination, wielded in a battle where defeat seemed certain,
yet refusing to give up. I won thanks to the difference in training and
luck, but I never reached that level."  
"……That's not true."  
"While my mother was being violated, I was trembling in a barrel… I'm a
weak man."  
  
The old soldier looked at the beautiful sword displayed above the
fireplace.  
His eyes narrowed, a melancholic expression on his face.  
  
"Even if you carry a beautiful sword at your hip, wear brave armor, and
act like a soldier, it makes no difference."
