## Chapter 328: The Creation of Heaven and Earth, an Eternity of Journey – The End

The first year passed in a flash. It was a year of both bewilderment at
my new body and environment, and joy at reunions.  
  
The first ten years also flew by. It was a decade during which I began
going out to shop, seeing various towns and cultures.  
  
The first hundred years also passed in an instant. As an observer, I
watched from afar a world without the Great Queen.  
  
I think I must have once lived in what could be called the center of the
world.  
The heroic tales and chronicles of the continental unification of Her
Majesty, the Great Queen, Krische-sama, and Selene-sama.  
Living in that small house at the heart of the Alberan Kingdom, which
would be etched into history and become legend – it's not entirely
inaccurate to say that.  
Indeed, saying "I think I must have" is probably more unnatural.  
  
When you look down at a storm from the heavens, the center of the
swirling vortex is calm. My own lack of strong feeling might be because
I spent my time by the side of those who were the storm itself. Perhaps
there was a fundamental dissonance from the beginning.  
  
For example, Argan-sama's death, from the perspective of the outside
world, was just one small event among many; something that those outside
would hardly notice. Even as someone close to Her Majesty the Queen, a
servant falling ill wouldn't even be worth mentioning. But from my
perspective – and from the perspective of those who lived in that house
– it was a cataclysmic event, and the resulting ripple effect spread
across the entire world. I felt, somewhere deep inside, that this was
only natural, yet when I thought about it, it was utterly unnatural and
absurd.  
  
The house was a kind of divine country. In the mythology of Alberan, the
enraged chief god, Oldoris, stomped his foot, shattering the smooth,
beautiful land to create hills and valleys, mountains and rivers; and
the tears shed by the goddess of beauty, Sha-Selene, became the rain
that formed rivers and seas.  
Furthermore, the gods’ emotions alone created the sun, the moon, the
stars, day and night, the seasons. As a child, I was amazed and
awestruck, but as an adult, I came to think they were terribly
troublesome gods. Beings who could remake the world with a single
emotion. To those who lived there, it could only be a nuisance; it was
only natural to fear and worship the gods, begging for their
forgiveness.  
  
"God" is a word that represents something unreasonable, and "Alberan"
represents the children of the gods. The "Alberan" I saw were pure and
innocent, like ageless children, wishing only for happiness within their
close, small world – beautiful girls. Many loved them, but conversely,
many hated and feared them, and each time, it saddened me. I wondered if
they were blind, but perhaps I was the blind one.  
  
Beings who could remake the world with the sorrow of a servant's death.
Beings who casually unified the continent in their spare time.  
They truly were, in the literal sense, beings of myth – Alberan, who
could shake the heavens and earth with a single emotion.  
They must have seen me, who unknowingly entered their divine country, as
something completely different.  
  
If a single emotion can change everything in the world, anyone would
find it terrifying. And perhaps I vaguely understood that they would
feel that way.  
  
The Alberan Kingdom of that time was undoubtedly a divine country. If
that was their intention, Kreschenta-sama could have brought about
eternal peace and stability for hundreds, thousands, even countless
years. However, for others, it also meant accepting all the absurdities
that did not conform to the will of the gods, being forced to endure all
the injustices.  
  
Watching the collapse of Alberan, which had seemed so unshakeable, and
the transition to the era of Kleinmere, I felt a certain amount of guilt
and loneliness, yet I could also accept that this was for the best.  
I think Krische-sama, who likely had similar thoughts, decided this was
the best path. Whether this was conscious or unconscious remains
unknown.  
  
"Ehehe, it was so long and hard to pronounce, so Krische gave him the
nickname 'Sleepy-eepy'. His eyes were so incredibly narrow that when
Krische first met him, Krische thought he was asleep while standing."  
"I see… Fufufu, that's so like Krische-sama."  
  
Walking behind Krische-sama and Argan-sama, I looked around. Alberan
hadn't changed much from before, except perhaps for the slightly
different crests displayed here and there. The crest of the capital, a
crescent moon overhead – Kleinmere. It signified the legacy of
moonlight, and the emperor, as the name suggested, was an acquaintance
of Krische-sama's. The grandson of the second director of the Magic
Research Institute (the first being Krische-sama); I'd never spoken to
him, but I had seen him a few times when he was still young.  
  
Krische-sama said that he was "quite clever," so he must be a genius
among geniuses.  
She'd described him as being "not unintelligent", which, for an ordinary
person, means brilliant, a genius. I'd never heard her use the phrase
"very intelligent" about anyone besides Argan-sama, and the term
"clever" is itself rare, excluding Count Faren. I recalled this, and my
thoughts drifted to him; it felt quite poignant.  
  
"He's the Emperor now… He's grown so much."  
  
"He started about here," she said, placing her hand on her hip, and
Argan-sama and I laughed. Krische-sama and Kreschenta-sama never forgot
anything they'd seen or heard. They could even recall what they'd done
on any given day decades ago, reciting their daily schedules
effortlessly. They could memorize every word of a book with a single
glance – strictly speaking, they could forget, but that was only like
having to search for a book in their mental library (one I’d like to
peek into).  
There wasn't anything they couldn't recall.  
  
Perhaps it was due to their phenomenal memory. Krische-sama, in
particular, had a strong tendency to remember her first impressions of
people and, if they were children at the time of their first encounter,
she would continue to treat them like children no matter how old they
grew. Kreschenta-sama said that "that's one of her clumsy points" (which
Kreschenta-sama herself did not have) but somehow, that made her seem
very much like Krische-sama.  
  
In Krische-sama's memory library, the cover of each book probably has a
drawing of their first meeting. Argan-sama had said this merrily some
years ago.  
  
I write in my diary every day, so I can always check it. My diary alone
was quite a large volume. Selene-sama made me a storage area for my
diary (though I had some qualms about making my master work for me), and
occasionally, I would shut myself away to read it. Even then, it would
take several days to read through. Every single word, every scene, every
single phrase—considering that even more detailed contents than those
diaries were constantly in her head, that's simply astonishing.  
  
The bookshelves in her mental library probably stretch as far as the
horizon. In the center, where Krische-sama is seated, her desk is surely
piled high with cookbooks and Argan-sama’s sayings.  
Just imagining that scene made me happy. The words Krische-sama used to
reprimand Kreschenta-sama were mostly from Argan-sama, and every time,
Kreschenta-sama's anger would turn towards Argan-sama; this was a
regular occurrence in the house.  
"Argan-sama doesn’t teach good things," was the common opinion of
Selene-sama and Kreschenta-sama. Watching Argan-sama skillfully evade
their accusations with her clever words was a secret pleasure of mine.  
  
Those days of fear and trembling were long gone. In the house, arguments
and squabbles were constant, centered around Argan-sama and Selene-sama.
But what a peaceful life it is. After overcoming so much internal
strife, war, and tragedy, all that remains is childish arguments.  
The eternal house, quietly standing outside the world.  
The words conjure up a noble image, but it doesn’t contain any
extraordinary elements, simply the everyday and ordinary; and everyone
desires that.  
Every time I realize that, I feel a deep sense of relief.  
I’m comforted to feel that everyone cherishes this trivial daily life.  
  
"It feels strangely surreal, walking through this town."  
"Surreal…?"  
"Even though I lived here for ten years, it feels like I’m here for the
first time. I remember going shopping with Krische-sama almost daily
while we were in Gurgain…"  
  
Argan-sama spent most of her time in the royal territory and in the
mansion.  
Due to her position, this was inevitable; if we're speaking about how
many times she’d been outside, Argan-sama had the least.  
  
"Walking through town, shopping—such commonplace and ordinary things
felt so completely out of reach back then… fufufu"  
  
Argan-sama’s eyes softened as she gazed at the cityscape around her.  
  
"…I remember thinking that someday, I'd want to leisurely stroll through
the town, just casually looking around and shopping, without any
particular reason."  
  
"And now, one of your dreams has come true," I said, chuckling
happily.  
  
If there was something to be done, Elvena-sama and I would take the
initiative. We felt we shouldn’t bother Argan-sama, who was the most
efficient worker. Hearing her words, however, I suddenly realized that
it might have been the opposite.  
  
Looking back, Argan-sama treasured those seemingly pointless moments
more than anyone.  
  
‘Argan-sama, where are you going?’  
‘It seems that the Ojou-sama has forgotten her lunch basket, so I was
thinking of delivering it…’  
‘Leave it to me! I’ll go instead!’  
‘U-um… I’ve pretty much finished my work and Kreschenta-sama won't be
getting up for a while, so Anne-sama, please take a break—’  
‘It’s okay! Argan-sama should rest…!’  
‘…W-well. Then, I’ll leave it to you…’  
  
Perhaps there were days when she wanted to take a leisurely stroll
outside. She enjoyed making time in his schedule for things and using
his time generously without having to do anything in particular.  
  
Kreschenta-sama often called Argan-sama frivolous and wasteful with her
time, and in a sense, this was an accurate assessment. Argan-sama
herself often said she was frivolous, and now I understand that this
wasn't false modesty but her true feelings.  
  
She would finish her work with superhuman speed, then spend an endless
amount of time indulging Kreschenta-sama’s whims, having tea, playing
with Gururun… Argan-sama luxuriously and lavishly wasted her time.  
I worried if she was alright, considering how busy she was, but maybe
that’s precisely why she did her daily work.  
  
I simply thought that upon arriving in the royal territory, she easily
adapted to and even improved her surroundings. I assumed that Argan-sama
would be able to adapt to any environment effortlessly and naturally.  
But surely, compared to her time living in Gurgain, there must have been
some inconveniences, difficulties, hardships, and things he had to
endure.  
I realized this belatedly, and my eyes widened in realization.  
  
"Ehehe, from now on, Krische’ll take you to many more towns. It seems
like peace has returned, and Krische wants to go with Bery to Arna, and
many other places, mountains and seas…"  
"Yes. I’d like to see many different places."  
"Yes! Space, and… ah, the moon is nice too. It’s only sand and rock, but
the stars are clearly visible; even this planet looks like a sparkling
jewel. Krische's sure Bery would be pleased too!"  
"My, my. Fufu, that sounds wonderful."  
  
And as I looked at Krische-sama, I realized something. Krische-sama must
have understood Argan-sama.  
  
We had avoided this area until there were as few people left who knew us
as possible, but since we could go out, Krische-sama had been suggesting
travel destinations more often than usual. She would take
Kreschenta-sama along, ostensibly for shopping, and would scout
beautiful locations around the world in advance.  
She would explain things to Argan-sama, saying things like, "this is how
it is, and you can see a very beautiful view", and that's what
Krische-sama's idea of a "beautiful" place is. For Krische-sama, the
scenery that made Argan-sama happy was a beautiful sight.  
  
Even just walking through town, Krische-sama's eyes sparkled
brilliantly. It was as if the surrounding scenery was brilliantly lit,
and its brilliance was reflected in her gaze.  
  
She bustled around Argan-sama.  
"That shop over there, this shop over here", she'd say enthusiastically,
dragging her around.  
Just watching them from behind warmed my heart, and the emotion nearly
welled up in my eyes before I quickly shook my head.  
  
The collapse of Alberan, a great war that engulfed the entire continent,
happened not so long ago. Although I decided to not get involved, I
couldn't be completely indifferent; I was a little worried about what
was happening.  
However, Alberan, when I visited it after so long, was almost exactly as
I remembered.  
  
In that place, Krische-sama and Argan-sama had the happiest of smiles on
their faces. Without hesitation or worry.  
  
I thought there might be some lingering unease. Considering everything,
this was the best outcome—Krische-sama and Selene-sama had worked hard
from their side, behind the scenes with Aleha-sama and others. They did
what they had to do, bringing a century of peace to a continent ravaged
by war.  
For a time, they built a peace that would be remembered in history.
However, even then, I think there was some slight guilt.  
Depending on how you look at it, they abandoned a greater peace for
their own happiness. It could be seen that way, and some people might
think so. Because the kingdom was divided, war broke out, and people who
might not have died did, in fact, die.  
  
The guilt I felt for remaining here. If the war had continued to drag on
and turn into a quagmire, that guilt would have become far greater. That
is why I was happy that the war ended so quickly and that we were moving
on to the next era.  
I recalled the image of a young boy looking at Krische-sama with adoring
eyes (he had very narrow eyes, just like his nickname suggested), and I
wondered if this peace was also a tribute to Krische-sama. Was I
overthinking?  
  
In any case, this peace and happiness wouldn't be ours alone.  
  
"Ah, there’s Koza’s shop. It seems to still be there."  
"Crescent Moon at Dawn… the simplified crest of Christand?"  
"Yes. It’s a shop that serves regular meals alongside lodging. It gets
tastier every time, and the simplified crest was added on Krische's
seventeenth visit. They don’t use very expensive ingredients, but Selene
and Kreschenta both said it was delicious… Anne liked it quite a bit,
didn’t she?"  
"Yes. It was a wonderful restaurant."  
  
As the name suggested, next to the sign depicting the dawn and a
crescent moon was the simplified crest of Christand.  
The shop, visible to the right, was exactly as it had been. The
seasoning was a bit strong, just the way I liked it. Unlike the
delicate, artistic, and refined cuisine of Argan-sama (and Krische-sama
and the others she taught), this was food for commoners. But this is
that. That kind of food was delicious. Considering the price, it was a
remarkably delicious restaurant, and we all ate there several times.  
  
"I see… hearing you say that makes it sound quite appealing."  
"Ehehe, Selene said she’d like to try it again if it’s still there, so
Krische thought we’d have it for dinner tonight…"  
"That sounds lovely. I’d like to try it as well."  
"Then it’s settled. Krische bears responsibility for allowing the
simplified crest, so she’d like to confirm that the taste hasn’t
deteriorated after the change of ownership. Koza said that if it’s bad,
don’t hesitate to complain." 
<br /><br />

Watching Krische nod repeatedly, I offered a wry smile.  
I remember when they were granted simplified crests, how Koza-sama and
Beltz-sama embraced, tears in their eyes.  
The shop, a renowned establishment in the castle town, continued to
thrive, its fine storefront retaining its aged appearance from that
time.  
They’ll surely serve nostalgic dishes.  
  
Each of them undoubtedly chose their own happiness and pursued their
desires.  
But I think that the present exists because so many wished for
Krische-sama’s happiness.  
  
"Over there, you see, is Mia and Kalua’s dojo. It’s quite large—"  
  
Seeing these familiar sights, as I took in the simple happiness of each
day, a deep sense of gratitude towards those people welled up within
me.  
  
These scenes, too, won’t last forever.  
They will surely fade someday, but that’s not a sad thing.  
  
They’ll simply melt away like a soft memory, fading in a gentle
farewell, never truly disappearing. 
<br /><br />

  
—I don’t have much longer.  
  
One day, while drinking tea in Gallen-sama’s room, I heard those
words.  
  
"Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about what will happen after I die."  
"Gallen-sama, such things—"  
"It’s not a pessimistic thought. It’s simply that people die eventually,
and I’ll be leaving Krische and you all a little sooner than others…
that’s all."  
  
As he said, his voice held no darkness, the usual gentle tone.  
The usual soft smile, like a fleeting laugh.  
  
"Grace and Golka… seeing Krische, who had lost her parents, I lamented
the shortness of my own life back then. I wanted to watch over that
child, to take the place of her parents… but there’s nothing I can do
about age. Krische, who killed a bandit for the village, was feared, had
nowhere to go… I argued with Galla, who was looking after Krische in
Grace's stead, many times about what to do."  
  
He sipped his black bean tea and gazed at the ceiling.  
  
"That’s why I entrusted her to Bogan. …If I were younger, I would have
considered leaving the village and living elsewhere with her, but
considering my age, I don’t have much time left. That child is
intelligent, talented, she wouldn’t have struggled to live… but because
of that, I wanted her to find someone she could rely on."  
  
Then, narrowing his eyes, he continued.  
  
"I wanted someone who would love her and watch over her."  
  
To me, it sounded like a prayer.  
  
"Back then, I couldn’t have imagined myself like this. …Krische was
always by my side—I truly thought she would be with me until the very
end."  
  
His voice, slightly hoarse, was a little strained, yet his words
continued joyfully.  
  
"But it turns out I’m alone. Krische lives happily in the mansion,
laughing amidst many people… and I’ve become an old man who occasionally
visits, doting on my grandchildren, just like any other."  
"Gallen-sama…"  
"While I find that a little lonely… it’s strange, but I’m truly
happy."  
  
Then, with a wry smile, he looked at me.  
  
"Now, I’m just one among many who loves her, and one among many who are
loved by her. The number of people she loves and who love her is
countless, and I’m no longer a special person to her. Krische will
grieve our parting… but that grief will fade amidst so much love,
becoming just one among many memories."  
  
I wanted to tell him that wasn’t true, but I couldn’t. Gallen-sama was
about the same age as my father, but my father is still youthful, while
Gallen-sama seemed much older. He wasn’t a noble, he didn’t possess
magic, and even if he lived a few more years, it wouldn’t be decades.  
No matter what I said, it wouldn’t be comforting, and he wasn’t looking
for such words. He had already accepted all of it.  
  
"Her Majesty the Queen is a wise ruler, though young. The recent war is
over, and peaceful days will continue… as long as that continues, she’s
a kind granddaughter who cherishes such days. Of course, things won’t
always go smoothly, but she’ll be surrounded by many kind people,
including you, and nothing like what happened in that small village will
occur. …I can’t see the future, but her future is quite bright…
surrounded by much love."  
  
His voice held an immeasurable amount of love. Unlike Argan-sama, he
wasn't by Krische-sama's side—but surely, he cherished the same deep
feelings in his heart, even from a distance. I felt that and lowered my
gaze.  
  
"Do you think farewells are sad things?"  
"……At least, right now."  
"Of course, there are sad farewells… but there are many that aren’t. I
had many subordinates. I haven’t seen many of them since leaving the
army, but many are probably happy in peaceful lives, not as soldiers.
Whether they’re alive or dead, I don’t even know."  
  
He said that’s what farewells are.  
  
"Such farewells are a part of life. It’s not limited to death. I won’t
see them again. But each of them has walked their own path, and that
parting, as a result, isn’t a sad thing. Don’t you have friends like
that?"  
"That… yes."  
  
Karen-sama, who was like a sister to me, returned to her family home and
got married, according to a letter I received.  
Her husband was a lower-ranking noble, but a fine young man, a wonderful
match, according to her cheerful letter.  
I probably won’t see her again.  
I felt a little lonely, but it wasn’t sad.  
  
"That’s how it is. The longer you live, the more farewells you’ll have.
Death is just one of those farewells, and if it’s a good farewell, then
that’s fine."  
  
Gallen-sama gazed at me kindly.  
  
"It makes me happy that you, a young lady, are here with this old man…
but there’s no need to grieve. It’s the same with Krische, and even
though I sense my death isn’t far off, I laugh, and feel happy to be
drinking tea with a kind girl like you. You’re young, you may not
understand yet, but it’s really not bad."  
  
Tears were falling without me realizing, and Gallen-sama stood up with a
wry smile, gently stroking my head.  
  
"Many farewells will become vivid memories, fading and wavering with
time, becoming recollections, and you’ll suddenly remember them when you
see something, and unknowingly smile… eventually, you’ll see such a
sight, just like me. At that time, like this—"  
  
His touch was firm, yet strangely soft.  
  
"I'd be happy if you remember drinking tea while listening to an old
man's ramblings and laugh about it."  
  
—As one of those trifling memories. 
<br /><br />

  
The moon, spoken of in so many words, has no beauty.  
When a crescent moon hangs, the sky is deep black; when it’s full, it's
deep blue.  
It is always the moon that dictates the color of the night sky.  
It's not as dazzling as the sun; its outline is clear—its modest
brilliance is its charm.  
I gaze at it every day, captivated by its beauty.  
  
I, too, understood it somewhat academically, but for me, the moon was a
distant landscape, a painting of sorts.  
Something I could never touch, an imaginary concept, a beauty.  
  
—To think that I am in such a place feels strange.  
  
The horizon was clear, without any blurring of the distant landscape.  
The sense of distance seemed distorted.  
Perhaps it was due to the abundance of sand and rock, or perhaps because
the distant view was so clear.  
  
Even though the sun is visible, the night sky is above.  
In the distance, a blue—the sphere we live in—shines like a jewel
against the backdrop of stars and void.  
It floats serenely.  
  
"Is that black bean tea?"  
"Yes, I felt like it."  
"I’ll have some too. I haven’t had much since I came here…"  
  
I nodded at Selene-sama’s words and poured black bean tea into a cup.  
After putting away the tent and other things, and finishing preparations
for our return, we took a moment to relax.  
She sat down next to the wooden box I was sitting on, took a sip of the
black bean tea—and frowned.  
  
"…Isn’t it a little too strong?"  
"Oh, shall I dilute it?"  
"No, it’s fine… you like it strong, don’t you?"  
"Gallen-sama liked it this strong… so I made it like this."  
  
"I see," Selene-sama laughed, wrapping her hands around the wooden cup
and looking towards the blue planet. Argan-sama was taking a walk with
the two of them bouncing on her shoulders, and Lira-sama was performing
some kind of Kre'Sharana ritual with Elvena-sama.  
With serious faces, they hopped around, piling up moonstones to build a
mysterious tower.  
  
That’s usually how it goes at the end of a trip.  
I often found Selene-sama relaxing next to me, looking a little tired,
away from the energetic two and Lira-sama who started the mysterious
ritual.  
  
"It’s beautiful, no matter how many times I see it. I’ve seen many
beautiful sights…"  
"Really. To think we’d ever come to a place like this. I got carried
away."  
"Fufufu, everyone was talking about you not coming back until dinner
time."  
  
It’s strange, but apparently everything is lighter on the moon.  
Heavier stars have stronger gravity, lighter stars have weaker
gravity.  
Selene-sama, who went for a walk happily hopping around, was lost for
half a day, apparently.  
  
"But it is a lonely place. The sky is beautiful, and it’s fun to float
around, but other than that, there's only sand and rock…"  
"Yes… it’s fun to visit, but I wouldn’t want to live here."  
  
Apparently, you can’t even breathe normally, and there are no living
creatures at all.  
The landscape, devoid of any vegetation, was bleak except for the starry
sky.  
  
"I enjoyed it quite a bit, and I think I’m good for the next twenty or
thirty years. Unlike the sea or mountains, it’s not something I want to
visit every year… I want to relax at the mansion for a while. My body’s
sense of things is off."  
"I imagine your body feels incredibly heavy."  
  
I smiled wryly, and Selene-sama nodded and took a sip of the black bean
tea. I also squinted at the bitter taste, and slowly looked up at the
starry sky.  
I captured it, sealing it away in my memories.  
  
"Drinking black bean tea while looking down at the earth from the moon…
repeating such silly things, before I knew it, a hundred years passed.
I’ve spent my time extravagantly, and I feel sorry for wasting it."  
"Indeed, it’s a life I couldn’t have imagined when we were on the other
side."  
"Me too. I’m shocked at how lazy I’ve become. I wonder what Aleha and
the others would think if they saw me messing around like this."  
  
I laughed at Selene-sama sighing and fell into thought before saying,  
  
"…When I was dying in the other world, I felt very happy."  
"…?"  
"Happy memories from the past floated up, surrounding me… I imagined the
scenery of the future I hadn’t yet seen. If I didn’t wake up, it would
have been fine."  
  
That’s exactly what Gallen-sama had said.  
Just a pleasant, happy time—a slow, gentle life.  
  
"When Gallen-sama passed away, I was very sad… but now that I’m in the
same position, I realize that Gallen-sama was truly happy. And I think
it’s probably not just Gallen-sama… when I went to Alberan the other
day, I felt the same way."  
"Ah, you were rather gloomy even during meals."  
"Yes… fufufu, it’s just the two of us here. We’ve flowed to a different
place than many others, and we’ve parted… but when I take in familiar
sights and food, I feel…"  
  
I watched the two of them joyfully bouncing on Argan-sama's shoulders in
the distance.  
  
"I think it’s the result of many people trying to leave something
behind. In their last moments, they might have thought of us now and
departed with a smile… I somehow feel that way."  
  
Alberan remained unchanged, a beautiful white city.  
The sounds of children’s energetic voices rang out from Kalua’s
swordsmanship dojo. At Koza’s shop, I savoured the same delicious food
as before. Of course, everyone has their own reasons.  
But I think one of those reasons was surely this:  
  
"So that the journey to the new world wouldn’t be lonely… A gentle
prayer."  
  
Gallen-sama's gentle face was reflected in the black bean tea.  
  
"…As a blessing for our eternity of journey."  
  
Closing my eyes, a smile naturally spread across my face.  
  
Most people were now in my memories.  
Sadness still comes, but even greater warmth fills my heart.  
With the ever-increasing happy memories, many things will fade and
become hazy, losing their form. But those gentle memories will surely
continue to emit a faint light in my heart.  
  
"You’ve been spacing out, what were you thinking about?"  
"No, it’s just that… when I drink black bean tea, I suddenly remember
Gallen-sama, and…"  
"Please don’t suddenly start crying all of a sudden. It always makes me
wonder what’s going on."  
"I, I’m sorry…"  
  
My eyes darted around. Selene-sama smiled wryly and gently stroked my
head.  
  
"But well, I agree with you. We were able to enjoy the moon in such a
foolish way with those fools thanks to those people. Alberan ended
ideally, and a new era has begun… I'm sure preparations were made for
that, but it wouldn’t have gone smoothly without it."  
"……Yes."  
"If even a little of that foolish child's whims could be made happy…
It’s thanks to people who thought that way. We can be here now, not just
because that child was amazing, but because many people watched over us,

"We should be be grateful," she said with a gentle smile.  
  
"...But I'm sure you would never forget that."  
  
Her hand, firm for a woman, was strangely soft.  
Remembering Gallen-sama’s hand, I shook my head.  
  
"No, I can’t say that for sure. I forget what I ate three days ago… it’s
been a hundred years since I came here, and as a summary of the hundred
years since I came here from the other side, I’m thinking of making a
book using my diaries."  
"…, Didn’t you make a similar book about fifty years ago? A ridiculously
thick one, three volumes."  
"That was a collection of stories from when I was on the other side, so
it’s a little different. This time, I’ll include the hundred years since
I came here, including gratitude."  
"R-Right…"  
"This time, it will probably be five volumes. Actually, I’ve already
decided on the title—"
