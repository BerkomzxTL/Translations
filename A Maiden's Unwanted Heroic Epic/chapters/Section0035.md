## Chapter 345: Charm IV

Roland deserved gratitude for weaving lies until her father's final
moments.  
Thanks to him, her father departed with a glimmer of hope in his
heart.  
He was a man of vile character, likely holding no affection for her
father.  
He must have been mocking him inwardly, but he never showed it to her
father's face.  
  
For better or worse, Roland was a merchant, a man who wouldn't do
anything that didn't turn a profit.  
If there was money to be made, he wouldn't hesitate to grovel, to
prostrate himself on the ground.  
Whatever it was, he used everything else as a means to achieve his
goals.  
Lazura thought there were things to learn from such a mindset.  
  
―The inn where Roland stayed was a grand one.  
Located northwest of Gurgain, it was the largest inn in Selcourt, where
Lazura and her family had lived, used for secret meetings and trysts by
nobles and the wealthy.  
Neither the innkeeper nor anyone else mentioned anything, even if they
realized Lazura was a noble.  
  
"—For now, rest assured. As you can see, I have personally covered and
compensated for the debts, and of course, I have no intention of
charging interest on this. However, the debts due to the surge in magic
crystal prices are simply insurmountable... Even if I take over the
contract for now, it's a significant loss. Despite my past dealings with
your father, if I accept this out of goodwill, I too would have to hang
myself."  
  
Various documents containing information on the Argan family's assets,
and certificates of debt.  
Lazura quietly observed them.  
Regarding the magic crystal contract, Roland had taken over on behalf of
the Argan family.  
He had estimated the loss if he were to take over the contract, and that
estimate was directly included in the debt.  
The estimate showed that even selling the mansion, including the family
treasures, wouldn't be enough.  
  
However, if one simply considered the numbers, it wasn't exorbitant; it
was reasonable.  
In fact, it was even a little cheap; one could call it fair.  
Most of it was predictable.  
In short, that difference was the price of Lazura and Bery.  
  
Originally, Roland had orchestrated the dismantling of the Argan
family.  
He must have pulled various strings behind the scenes to minimize his
losses, and perhaps there were hardly any losses to begin with, but
there was no point in contemplating how much profit he gained.  
In business, her father lost, and Roland won.  
That was all there was to it, and that outcome could not be overturned
no matter what.  
She closed her eyes, relaxing her shoulders.  
  
"I am prepared, Roland. Facing a young girl who has lost her father and
is holding a debt... At this point, there's nothing to fear, is there?
Don't hold back, you can speak bluntly."  
"As expected of the sagacious Lazura-sama... You catch on quickly. And
such admirable resolve."  
  
He spread his hands wide exaggeratedly, a bestial grin on his face.  
Triumphant, looking down, he gazed at Lazura, basking in his pleasure.  
  
"I genuinely respect your remarkable spirit, and that's not sarcasm.
...Where will I be sold? Haven't you already decided?"  
"Yes, there are plenty of candidates. As for Bery-sama, there are
several people who wish to take her in... Of course, I've informed them
of her age and physical condition, but they still say it's fine."  
  
Lazura furrowed her brow.  
Roland deepened his smile, not bothering to hide his malice.  
  
"I thought you would make such a face. Lazura-sama aside, Bery-sama is,
of course, of a certain age... Whether she finds a good match is largely
a matter of luck. Of course, I intend to carefully vet the partners,
but... the world is a terrifying place. There are those who, under the
guise of benevolent kindness, possess unspeakable, abominable tastes."  
  
He laughed at Lazura, who involuntarily clenched her fist.  
He was well aware of Lazura's resolve—and even then, Roland mocked
her.  
  
"If you have any human compassion, would you grant me just one wish?"  
"Of course, I too feel distressed. For the daughter of the esteemed
Baron Argan to meet such an unfortunate end."  
  
It was admirable how well he could speak.  
Suppressing her anger, she quietly bowed her head.  
  
"I don't care what happens to me. Whatever the person, whatever I
endure, even if I'm killed, I won't complain. ...But please, save only
that child somehow."  
"This is troublesome. With Lazura-sama bowing her head like that, I have
no standing."  
  
Roland said, with a hint of laughter.  
  
"How about this? You both participate in a gathering in the capital."  
"...A gathering?"  
"Yes, please raise your head."  
  
Roland watched Lazura with amusement.  
  
"It's a gathering of the capital's wealthiest individuals... a kind of
social event. It varies from balls to other festivities, but how about
Lazura-sama finds a partner herself there?"  
"...Bery too?"  
"Yes, it's possible... that you might meet a kind person who would take
both you and your younger sister. It would depend on negotiations with
that person, but... if you can choose your partner with your own eyes,
Lazura-sama might find it easier to accept."  
  
It wouldn't be a proper gathering.  
A place where only people like Roland would gather.  
  
"As you're thinking, it's a place outside the sun's reach... To put it
bluntly, it's like a brothel where children of nobles and merchants with
'circumstances' are gathered. However, with Lazura-sama's beauty and
intelligence, there will surely be those who will want to buy her
freedom, even if it means taking on the debt."  
"...You're telling me to become a prostitute."  
"Yes. Of course, as for Lazura-sama, there are many excellent suitors
even now... Your beauty is well known in the north, so if you have any
resistance—"  
"No, that's fine. Take me."  
  
There was no need to think.  
Even as a prostitute, she would be quite high-class.  
There were countless poor people in the world who sold their bodies just
to eat.  
  
"As expected of Lazura-sama... I am truly moved. If, by any chance,
Bery-sama's guardian is not decided, I will consider taking her in at my
own expense. ...Rest assured, my tastes are quite normal in that
sense."  
"..."  
"If her health improves, she will surely grow into a beautiful woman,
just like Lazura-sama."  
  
He mocked Lazura's resolve, everything.  
But there was no point in raising her voice and cursing him.  
  
"Now then, I must get to know Lazura-sama well to introduce her to
high-ranking individuals. I would certainly like to examine your body...
and I must also teach you various bedroom manners so as not to be
rude."  
  
Besides, she hadn't lost everything.  
Her name alone remained, and there was someone Lazura had to protect.  
As long as that was true, as long as she believed that—even if she
prostrated herself on the ground, even if she licked shoes, her noble
way of being would not be defiled.  
  
"...Yes. Do as you please."  
  
She spoke, then stood up and looked at the bed.  
She had been prepared even before being summoned. She wouldn't be shaken
now.  
Just exposing her naked body and being embraced.  
When put into words, that was all it was.  
She only needed to be dignified, so as not to shame her name.  
There was no need to lament. 
<br /><br />

  
Returning to the mansion after dark, she saw the faces of the servants,
full of concern and pity.  
She smiled and announced that her marriage had been decided, thanked
them for everything, and then went straight to Bery's room.  
  
"...Nee-sama."  
"Honestly, are you still awake?"  
  
The window in the room was open, and the air was chilly.  
It had been the same when she left.  
Perhaps she had been looking outside.  
From when Lazura left until she returned.  
Her face seemed to already understand what Lazura had been doing.  
  
She gently stroked Bery's head, who was looking down slightly.  
Then, she thought for a while about what to tell her.  
  
A kind lie probably wouldn't even be kindness.  
  
"Next week, we will ride in Roland's carriage and head to the capital.
...To put it plainly, we'll be slave sisters. We're selling
ourselves."  
  
In her usual tone, as usual.  
She decided to tell her that way.  
  
"We had a bit of bad luck, but well, it's not a bad deal. When you
consider people who have to sell their bodies in exchange for bread,
these are overly favorable terms. Your Onee-sama is the most beautiful
woman in the world, and even if I'm not as clever as you, I'm still
smart. I'll find a rich partner, get bought out, and then live a life of
ease with you."  
  
Bery listened in silence.  
Perhaps she wasn't thinking about her own future at all.  
  
"Don't worry. I'll take care of you—"  
"...Nee-sama."  
  
What she was thinking about was Lazura.  
  
"Please don't worry about me. ...If it were just you, Nee-sama, couldn't
you find a suitor without having to sell yourself in such a place?"  
  
Her sister was smarter than anyone.  
Lazura hesitated again, then gave a wry smile and nodded.  
  
"..., Yes, perhaps."  
"Then please do that. I don't want to make Nee-sama any more..."  
  
She looked up, placing a hand on Lazura's cheek.  
Straight, honest, earnest brown eyes looked into hers.  
  
"...Please don't let me make you any more unhappy, Nee-sama."  
  
Lazura touched the small, trembling hand and narrowed her eyes.  
She truly felt fortunate to have such a sister by her side.  
  
"I'm happy because you are here, Bery. Because you are here, I can still
be happy."  
"That's not—"  
"—If you're not here, I can't move forward."  
  
She pressed her cheek to Bery's hand and smiled quietly.  
Lazura was still a child, not an adult.  
Or perhaps, even as an adult, one remained that way forever.  
  
Without anything to protect, she wasn't strong enough to stand alone.  
There was someone who cared for her more than she cared for herself.  
Only such a happy reality allowed Lazura to stand firmly on her own two
feet.  
  
"What you're saying isn't wrong. It would probably be easier. But for
me, it's not even an option to consider. ...More than anything, I
wouldn't forgive myself for such happiness."  
  
She caressed her sister's cheek, as the girl was holding back tears.  
  
"I swore on this name before Father. That I wanted him to leave
everything else to me. But it's not out of responsibility or obligation.
I simply chose the way of life I believe in, decided by me, a life where
I don't shame myself..."  
  
Then, she smiled.  
  
"I declare it. It will be hard, and I will cause you pain. ...But if you
recognize me as a noble, please let me keep my vow."  
  
Her sister, with a distorted face, clenched her fists with downcast
eyes.  
Lazura hugged her small body, then slipped into the bed with her.  
  
"...Even if you lose everything, a noble's name remains. That's how I
want to live. ...But even this great Onee-sama, who usually acts so
proud, is actually still a child. I can't live that way alone."  
  
No matter what happened to her, she wouldn't defile her name.  
It would be easy to say.  
But humans were weak and fragile, and their hearts sometimes wavered.  
Lazura didn't trust herself enough to assert that she could uphold that
vow.  
  
"That's why I need you. ...Do you understand?"  
  
She cupped Bery's cheeks with both hands this time, wiping away her
tears with her fingers.  
Large, light brown eyes were fixed on Lazura's.  
The tears that flowed, purely and sincerely for Lazura, were more
beautiful than anything in this world.  
  
No matter what happened to her, she wouldn't defile her name.  
She didn't think she could uphold such a vow.  
But for a girl shedding such beautiful tears, she felt as if she
could.  
  
"As long as Nee-sama... needs me."  
  
Perhaps her sister understood those strong words far more deeply than
Lazura imagined.  
She, who cursed herself more than anyone, was now to be protected and
kept alive even further.  
The look in her eyes as she gazed at Lazura, she thought, was love—and
also deep hatred.  
  
In return, the words her sister continued with were,  
"...Will you stay with me forever?"  
  
A sweet, pleading request.  
A childish request from a girl who wouldn't allow herself such a
thing.  
The first and last small selfishness for herself, spoken by a girl who
had desired nothing.  
Something that, depending on how one heard it, could be easily
dismissed.  
  
"...Of course, as long as you wish for it."  
  
That question was probably a kind of contract.  
What future had her sister envisioned in a situation that even Lazura
found pessimistic?  
  
She nestled closer, pressing her face into Lazura's chest, as if in
relief.  
A contract to fall together into the deepest depths of the earth.  
To share life and death—for her sister, she thought, those words were
heavier than any pledge of a lovers' suicide.  
  
The love of a sister who didn't even wish to live was deeper than
anyone's, heavier than anyone's, clinging tightly.  
It was a reckless love, almost like an obsession. 
<br /><br />

  
The following week, they rode Roland's carriage to the capital.  
The long-serving retainers who had remained until the end shed tears as
they saw them off.  
That's why Lazura smiled as she bid them farewell.  
  
Their circumstances would worsen.  
They would likely be treated cruelly.  
But that was all there was to it.  
If there were people who worried about her, there was no need for her to
worry herself.  
  
She would probably be bewildered by the sudden change, but one
eventually gets used to things.  
And while not as talented as her sister, she was quite capable and
good-looking.  
If she was going to be a prostitute anyway, she might as well aim for
the top and enjoy it.  
Lazura believed that she could find one or two things to enjoy
anywhere.  
  
During the journey, her sister was compliant.  
She ate all her meals, even if forced, and rested properly.  
Sometimes she would lie with her head on Lazura's lap, snuggling close
as if seeking comfort.  
  
Lazura knew why she did that, and it made her cherish her all the
more.  
  
"Look, Bery. Those are the Twin Mountains."  
  
Whether she was awake or asleep, Bery, holding Lazura's arm, quietly
looked out the window at the sound of her voice.  
Two mountains stood side by side.  
It had been a long time since they had entered the capital region.  
Before Bery was born, when she was a child, held by her stepmother in a
carriage—was it to attend some banquet?  
She didn't remember much, but she remembered the scenery.  
  
Lazura, excited about her first long journey, and her stepmother,
smiling gently.  
When Lazura said, "Two mountains," her stepmother replied, "Those are
the Twin Mountains."  
With such a small travel memory.  
  
"Beyond those is the capital region... The climate will get a bit
warmer, so it might be easier for Bery to live there. However, it's a
bit hilly when we pass through, so try not to get motion sick."  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."  
"They're called that because they're like twins. I think, yes, they were
originally one mountain and then..."  
"According to the books, an ancient dragon split into two."  
"Yes, that's it."  
  
Lazura nodded, holding up a finger.  
  
"First one, then two... Even if not twins, sisters are similar. Should I
name the slightly taller one Mount Lazura?"  
"...It's Mitskronetia."  
"Don't interject so calmly. Your Onee-sama will call anything whatever
she wants. The smaller one is Mount Bery."  
  
Lazura laughed and put Bery on her lap.  
  
"Fufu. ...Are sisters like two halves of a whole? Just as there's a me
you envy, there's a you I envy... Yet, we just stay by each other's
side. It's sometimes cruel, but also a happy thing."  
  
The one who stayed closest, showing her many things.  
Bery was like Lazura's mirror image, with many things being the exact
opposite.  
Their personalities, their strengths, many things were different from
Lazura.  
Yet, strangely, there were parts that connected them, making it
impossible to think of her as a stranger.  
  
"I'm not perfect, but I feel perfect as long as I have you. As your
Onee-sama, I am flawless and fearless."  
  
—So you just need to stay by my side.  
  
Her sister didn't answer those words, simply pressing her face against
her.  
Her sister would take it as consideration.  
As an insult to her resolve, which even welcomed death.  
However, it was Lazura's undeniable true feeling.  
  
A weak heart that only wished to live, that wanted to throw everything
away.  
Choosing the easy path was always simple, and her body felt as if it
could float away.  
Only the heavy, clinging love of her sister, who was throwing herself
away, pushed her feet firmly onto the uncertain ground.  
  
"I love you, Bery."  
  
Gently caressing her, Lazura closed her eyes too.  
Feeling the weight of her sister.  
  
The carriage journey continued quietly.  
Upon reaching the capital, they were assigned a room in an inn located
in the first-class district.  
While her dresses were being tailored, Lazura was taken by Roland to
various banquets to make appearances and greetings.  
It was probably like introducing newly arrived merchandise, in that
sense.  
  
When the dresses were finished, they visited one of the large
mansions.  
The evening gown tailored for her was made of fabric so thin it was
almost transparent, like underwear.  
It was merely a slightly refined prostitute's dress; it remained
vulgar.  
It was Bery's first dress—Lazura regretted that she hadn't forced her to
wear hand-me-downs when they were still at the mansion.  
Because if Bery heard the word "dress," she would surely recall this
moment.  
  
"—Oh... truly beautiful. You both look wonderful."  
  
Roland laughed gleefully upon seeing them, and Lazura gave him a cold
look.  
Bery glared at him with hatred.  
  
"Bery-sama, you mustn't make such a face. It's understandable that you
resent me... that's fine, but if you are rude to others, Lazura-sama
will be in trouble. I won't tell you to smile, but please don't look
like that in public."  
"...Yes."  
  
Lazura placed a hand on Bery's shoulder and sighed.  
  
"It's refreshing to wear a dress I wouldn't normally wear, thank you for
the lovely dress. If it's a gift, I'd be happy to receive a few more...
It's hard to make one dress work for everything."  
  
Roland nodded, impressed.  
  
"Normally I'd want you to buy them yourself, but... since it's
Lazura-sama's request. They won't be newly tailored, but I'll find a few
old ones and have them refitted."  
"Oh, it's worth asking."  
"...Most young ladies brought here like this either simply wallow in
sadness, or they're scared and fawn, or they become desperate... well,
something like that. It's rare to find someone like Lazura-sama who can
accept reality with dignity and look to the future. ...It's dazzling to
someone of my low standing."  
  
He was a man who mocked and looked down on nobility.  
However, she thought that once, it might have just been envy or
jealousy.  
His self-deprecating words, meant to mock, also seemed to contain a hint
of his true feelings.  
  
"Yes, even flattery is welcome."  
"...I insist, it's from the heart."  
  
He was petty and vulgar, the worst kind of man.  
But that was only Lazura's perspective.  
For such a man to reach this position, he must have endured considerable
hardship and humiliation that Lazura, born a noble, could not
understand.  
To a man who had nothing, nobles who grew up in the sunlight while being
fed pleasantries must have been objects of hatred.  
  
She hated him, and naturally wanted to kill him.  
However, she understood him enough to feel that they were even, and she
also pitied him.  
  
She believed this man would not hesitate to lick someone's shoes if
there was a benefit.  
But no one truly enjoyed doing that.  
It was undoubtedly unpleasant; he simply said he was used to it,
probably because he had lived such a life long enough to become
accustomed to it.  
  
It was easy to look down on him as trash, lacking dignity and pride, but
that was not the correct view, as her father once described.  
If one didn't look with the intention to learn, one wouldn't gain
anything.  
At least, this man was also someone Lazura should learn from.  
  
"I am a merchant... and I believe my judgment is sound. Objects and
people, everything in this world is a mix of good and bad... I have
lived by discerning their value. It is precisely because I believe
Lazura-sama possesses such value that I act as I do... It is neither
sentiment nor flattery, but a merchant's principle."  
  
With exaggerated gestures, like an actor.  
Roland bowed, like a clumsy, comical jester mocking everything.  
  
"To be frank, I am reluctant to let you go. ...But I don't want anything
so valuable near me. As you know, I am a humble and insignificant
man."  
  
Lazura smiled.,  
"You'll live a long life, Roland. ...As long as your eyes don't cloud
over."  
"Your advice is appreciated. I will engrave it in my heart."  
  
It was meant as pure praise.  
Otherwise, she wouldn't understand why her father had died.  
  
After that, she attended gatherings with Roland.  
They were banquets that featured somewhat vulgar entertainment, but
nothing more.  
She participated quite normally, greeted people, and if she was favored,
she went to a separate room and sold flowers.  
Or perhaps later, at an inn somewhere.  
  
She didn't feel miserable.  
She had the freedom to choose her partners, and sometimes she was given
gold coins for the return carriage fare.  
There were quite a few who paid extra for her favors, making her a
high-class "flower seller."  
As long as she abandoned girlish aspirations like confirming love or
sacred rituals, the act was just an act, and the work was just work.  
It was nothing significant.  
  
Bery always accompanied Lazura.  
She waited patiently outside the room until Lazura finished her work and
reappeared.  
At first, Lazura told her to go back ahead, but soon she gave up.  
Many people showed interest in the small girl, and leaving her alone was
unsettling.  
She felt that if allowed, her sister would choose that path
immediately.  
  
Every time they met after work, Bery's large, light brown eyes would
look up at Lazura.  
As if concerned for her beloved Lazura, as if saddened—or perhaps, as if
hating her.  
As if waiting for Lazura's spirit to break and for her to be needed.  
  
She thought that Bery found it unbearable that only Lazura remained
unsullied.  
Accompanying Lazura like this was probably a form of self-harm.  
  
Her eyes, tinged with a dark expectation, seemed to wish to fall into
ruin together.  
The twilight color, the boundary with night, was terrifyingly beautiful,
clinging and entwining.  
If Lazura wished it, Bery would surely follow her anywhere.  
Even to the very bottom of deep darkness, filled with a gloomy sense of
relief.  
  
Those words were probably such a contract.  
That's why her sister's love, like hatred, deepened day by day.  
  
"Unfortunately, it seems they won't buy us this time either. They have
no taste."  
"...Is that so?"  
  
That's why Lazura always smiled at Bery.  
No matter what she lost in, she couldn't afford to lose to her sister in
a battle of wills.  
  
"Honestly, I'm hungry from being so angry. Shall we go back, Bery?"  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."
