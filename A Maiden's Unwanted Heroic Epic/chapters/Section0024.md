## Chapter 334: Crescent Moon at Dawn III

Krische-sama had several ominous nicknames, but the most famous was
probably Headhunter.  
Later, the name naturally disappeared, but I haven't forgotten the
origin. Or rather, it would be more accurate to say that we can't forget
it. That battle was the one where we truly came to know Krische
Christand.  
  
"The objective is to buy time until our friendly forces can reorganize.
Therefore, delaying enemy actions is the top priority. Engagements will
be limited to surprise attacks and ambushes. Unless otherwise
instructed, prepare for retreat after eliminating the dogs. Do not
pursue the enemy."  
  
Those words marked the beginning of a grueling week.  
  
The battle for the Dragon's Maw ended in victory for the King's younger
brother, Gildanstein. However, it wasn't a complete defeat, and in terms
of damage ratio, we were overwhelmingly victorious.  
While I understand the logic that losing the general means losing the
battle, we won in every other aspect.  
So even if we lost, it was a narrow defeat at best.  
  
We burned the enemy alive along with the mountain, and even in the
retreat, inflicted several times more casualties.  
We also went wild in our first battle, achieving a decisive victory
there.  
Having witnessed Krische-sama on the battlefield, we fear nothing. We
were hesitant about her words to hold back the entire enemy army with
just one Century, but we thought we could do it with this unit and
Krische-sama.  
  
Even the King's younger brother, known as a monster, fled from
Krische-sama.  
A monster among monsters, she single-handedly climbed the cliff and
retrieved the general's sword. Even those who disliked her were
optimistic about even dangerous missions if she was directly in command,
and they even joked about her becoming a hero afterward.  
  
A headstrong Ojou-sama who would burn down an entire mountain to win.  
Honestly, I was terrified of her monstrous nature, including the way she
harvested heads like mowing grass, but as an ally, there's no more
reliable commander. A monster who will do anything to win is a valuable
asset, not an enemy.  
  
Despite her father-in-law's death, Krische-sama remained calm. Her calm
instructions reassured us, and witnessing her casually slaughter the
enemy army commander and his adjutant in the initial surprise attack was
exhilarating. We were tasked with eliminating the enemy's sappers, and
the first attack yielded a devastating result that made the enemy seem
pitiable.  
  
The head of the army commander who commanded five thousand soldiers,
with only a Century. On top of that, having killed many times that
number, that alone would make her a hero — we laughed with our comrades,
looking forward to returning to the fortress.  
  
Most of them thought it would end with that attack. By any standard, it
was a praiseworthy feat for a single Century.  
But Krische-sama, naturally, ordered the continuation of the delaying
tactics.  
  
We reluctantly agreed that it was necessary, and there were no problems
for the first two days. However, during that time, we destroyed a total
of seven Centurys. Fatigue began to set in, and some men started making
mistakes. Although magic users are superhuman compared to ordinary
people, they don't have steel bodies, and they will die if stabbed.  
One man died, and several were injured, so the captain finally suggested
reconsideration.  
  
"...Commander, the soldiers are becoming too fatigued to ignore. I
humbly suggest that the objectives of this operation have been
sufficiently achieved."  
"...Krische deems it insufficient. But Krische understands the
situation. You will rest for a while."  
"...? Where to...?"  
"As Krische said, someone will be inspecting the fort for repairs soon.
Krische'll go take care of them."  
  
Having said that, she disappeared into the trees, leaving the captain
dumbfounded. We were also stunned, exchanging glances. Could she
possibly intend to attack alone?  
  
We thought something was wrong after hearing that exchange. As the
captain said, by any measure, we had achieved more than enough
results.  
We had eliminated a large number of sappers and burned the fort.
Although ordinary soldiers learn basic civil engineering like building
fences, sappers skilled enough to build a fort are usually former
carpenters or craftsmen — losing them would significantly delay the
fort's repair.  
  
But what did she mean by insufficient? The captain seemed to be thinking
for a while, then clapped his hands,  
  
"We will take a long break in preparation for the Commander’s return.
Squads one through ten, you may lie down lightly in the center. Everyone
else, sit facing outward on the perimeter. ...Colinz, some sentries."  
"Yes sir."  
  
He told us this because Krische-sama was a literal monster.  
  
Seeing her fight, no one would dare defy her. She would pass through
like the wind, slaughtering several men, unfazed even by attacks from
behind, as if she had eyes in the back of her head. Even I changed my
swords twice, but Krische-sama used only that small curved sword.
Although she sometimes used discarded swords, she killed over a hundred
people with that sword, which would be considered high-quality even
after killing ten people.  
  
She carved into the soft flesh of their necks.  
Even in battle, Krische-sama had the composure to choose her targets. At
first, I thought she was just aiming for the neck, but it was simply to
avoid damaging the blade. To Krische-sama, battle was no different from
cooking—she must have seen her enemies as ingredients on a cutting
board.  
  
Her strength was beyond human comprehension, and that's why the captain
gave up. It was insane for a commander to charge into the enemy alone,
but Krische-sama could make such insanity work. In normal circumstances,
it would have been necessary to stop her, but Krische-sama was an
exception to the 'normal'.  
  
"Mia, isn't something wrong with Usa-chan?"  
"You think so too? I was wondering if she was alright..."  
  
Hearing that conversation, I turned to Kalua and the others who were
rolling around nearby.  
  
"What's that about?"  
"Before we got here, Usa-chan was clinging to her maid and crying. The
general was her stepfather, so I thought she might be overworking
herself out of a sense of responsibility."  
"...She doesn't look like it though."  
"That kid hasn't had a proper rest since then. She let us rest after the
central area fell back, but she became the vanguard and went on a
rampage, and immediately came here with us as soon as it was over."  
  
When you think about it, that was true.  
I had seen her take short naps in the mountains, but while ordering us
to stand by, she was going out alone for reconnaissance, and we were
acting on the instructions based on the information she gathered. We
hadn't had sufficient rest either, but in the meantime, Krische-sama had
been running around this mountain alone conducting reconnaissance.  
I don't think she had any proper rest.  
  
"Her fatigue is probably showing in her movements. Did you see the sword
Usa-chan is using?"  
"...? Ah, it's amazing, doing that with a sword like that."  
"No, I mean, she'd been slaughtering people for days, and there wasn't a
single chip in the blade. But I saw a chip in it just now."  
  
Kalua said, resting her arms behind her head and squinting at the sky.  
  
"It means she's no longer able to spare any thoughtfulness. Sure,
Usa-chan is incredibly strong, but she has that body… she doesn't seem
to have superhuman stamina."  
"...Well, that's true."  
"And she's childish as you can see… I just thought we should take a bit
more care of her…"  
"—Kalua, stop chattering. Resting when you can is part of your job."  
"Yessss…understood, Captain."  
"Don't drag out your 'yes'."  
  
The captain, apparently noticing us talking, said, and the conversation
ended.  
Resigned, I and the others who had been listening closed our eyes.  
  
While I thought it would be better to take care of her, our rest was the
most important thing.  
Lightly closing my eyes, just being able to lie down made a difference
in relieving fatigue. Even a moment of letting go of consciousness
cleared my head considerably.  
  
My awakening from a light sleep was to a scream echoing from the top of
the mountain.  
There was no need to guess who was causing it. The only Christand
soldiers here were us, and only one person had gone to the top of the
mountain. The scream went on for a long time, then gradually stopped.  
  
Krische-sama appeared some time later, dripping a large amount of blood
from her overcoat.  
  
"Bald Eagle, water."  
"Y-yes…"  
  
The captain immediately offered her a water bottle, and she took a sip
and coughed slightly.  
She stopped the captain, who was hastily patting her back.  
  
"I'm fine. Continue resting. ...The enemy has retreated. They won't move
immediately. Tomorrow, we will observe the situation and then act."  
  
She sat down, leaning her back against a tree, frowned, took off her
gauntlets, and placed them on the ground.  
Her hands were covered in blood, with blisters and abrasions.  
  
The captain offered her a hand as she took out bandages from a small
pouch at her waist.  
  
"Leave the treatment to Krische. ...Burza, the medicine."  
"Y-yes sir!"  
  
Burza, who was a pharmacist, approached and began the treatment.
Krische-sama hesitated for a moment, then said "Thank you," and fell
silent.  
  
Those of us watching didn't say a word, just looked at the young girl.  
  
The next day, as usual, she led the troops on an attack, taking care of
our stamina, resting half of the unit.  
The only one who always accompanied her was the captain.  
  
As Kalua said, her physical limits were clearly visible.  
Her cheeks were flushed, as if she had a fever, and she was unsteady.  
Nevertheless, Krische-sama went on reconnaissance almost alone and
repeated attacks without rest.  
  
Naturally, her fever worsened, and each time she returned from an
attack, she would collapse and sit down, leaning her back against a
tree.  
She would soak hardtack in water and eat it, even seemingly reluctant to
do so, swallowing her food and then closing her eyes and falling asleep
as if she was losing consciousness.  
  
She looked nothing like the carefree Ojou-sama who was casually nibbling
cookies and observing the battle. Even those who had spoken ill of her
showed concern.  
  
It was no longer a matter of stamina.  
No matter how strong she was, she was still a child. A girl who was not
even five feet tall couldn't possibly have greater stamina than us.  
  
She was far beyond her physical limits.  
A normal person would probably not even be able to stand up from
exhaustion, yet because she could manipulate magic, she could still
move. Literally, Krische-sama was moving her body solely on willpower.  
  
Naturally, the captain proposed a retreat many times, but she wouldn't
agree.  
  
"If Krische can buy even a moment, it will give Selene time to recover.
To retreat again while we can still fight... Krische could no longer
face Selene."  
  
She sometimes said that, and other times,  
  
"Selene was angry with the useless Krische. ...After Master died, she
cried a lot... because Krische was useless, Krische... Krische was
disliked by Selene..."  
  
She muttered these words in a hazy state and fell asleep.  
  
The captain instructed the injured soldiers to tell Selene about
Krische's condition, and an order to retreat from Selene-sama was
immediately relayed, but she still shook her head. It was as if she was
punishing herself.  
  
We kept repeating that she would probably retreat tomorrow, but by the
fifth day, we were at our limits. Honestly, we wanted to run away from
here. If it were a different opponent, we probably would have done so,
possibly faking an accident and making it look like an honorable
death.  
  
However, Krische-sama was, for better or worse, a child.  
Seeing a fourteen-year-old child covered in wounds desperately fighting,
grown adults couldn't just leave her and run away, nor could they utter
a single complaint.  
  
Krische-sama was cunning in many ways. She was simply earnest, diligent,
and didn't care about other people's opinions.  
She probably wouldn't utter a single complaint even if her limbs were
torn off.  
She also had the appearance of a supremely beautiful princess—making
others think, 'What would we do if we didn't stand our ground here?'  
  
In a way, it was Krische-sama's selfishness. We were forced to
participate in a life-or-death battle, yet we couldn't complain and
offered our lives, following her. It was almost as if it was imposed on
us.  
Krische-sama was the kind of person who naturally made others feel that
way.  
  
Whether she had a fever or was at her limit was irrelevant.  
Krische-sama worked harder than anyone else, killed more than anyone
else, and saved more comrades than anyone else.  
We couldn't utter a single complaint in front of such a child.  
  
As the situation worsened day by day, Krische-sama's sword became more
savage. The deterioration of her exquisite swordsmanship finally made
its ferocity understandable to us ordinary people. Krische-sama's savage
sword was a demonic blade that even terrified us, her allies.  
  
"...!"  
  
The small curved sword carved into necks or severed them. Even the
random blows of a stumbling sword became a legendary blade in the hands
of Krische Christand. She bisected swords, cleaving torsos in two,
without stopping.  
  
When she turned her gaze, it was a forest of death. The trees were
stained red and black with the remnants of life, human beings
transforming into fountains of blood in the blink of an eye.  
In this battle, how many lives did she end? It was absurd even to count
them.  
  
Red flowers bloomed a beat after she ran past, like she was enveloped in
a red wind, the red of life reflecting beautifully on her silver hair
and white cheeks.  
  
She threw spears, turning several people into pieces of meat, creating
death simply by running. Sometimes she broke necks with her feet,
causing the viscera to spill from their mouths, making them seem like
beings from a different world.  
  
She had the appearance of a young girl, but it was merely a concept.  
No trace of emotion, no hesitation.  
She just killed because she had a sword in her hand and stood before
them.  
  
As a warrior, it was the most correct way to be. But it was not the way
of a human being.  
  
Compared to someone who killed people for simply standing in their way,
a pleasure killer would be a much more human creature. Krische Christand
was a young girl who easily crossed that line.  
  
"U-uwaaaaaaaaaa!!"  
"Tch…!"  
  
While my attention was taken, a shock hit my body.  
It was a soldier reeking of urine. I was knocked to the ground, the back
of my helmet hitting a tree root or something. While I was momentarily
dazed, he grabbed his short sword with his reverse grip and swung it
down, trying to stab me.  
  
"K-Koza!"  
  
A comrade from our squad noticed my condition, but it was too late.  
I stared blankly at his face, thinking I was dead. He was probably about
fifteen, a kid who hadn't even grown much hair. Even before joining this
place, he was an amateur I could have defeated a hundred times in
one-on-one combat.  
He was definitely not someone who should have killed me, but this is
war, I thought with a wry smile.  
  
It's a pity that even if he killed me, nothing would change. He would
immediately be killed by my comrades, and that would be the end of it.  
If I was going to die a dog's death, I wanted to at least have the
reward of killing me.  
  
"O-…?"  
  
Something sliced through the air, and the kid's head suddenly shifted.
The shift widened, and his head fell off, replaced by a spray of
blood.  
  
I hastily pushed aside his corpse and looked towards where something had
passed. A long sword had flown and stuck into the ground at the base of
a tree. I looked in the direction it came from, seeing silver hair and a
hand braced on the ground, the posture of someone having thrown a sword.
She bowed her head, panting.  
  
"Are you alright!?"  
"Y-yes…"  
  
I looked around, seeing that the battle was almost over. I immediately
stood up and rushed to Krische-sama.  
  
"Thank you! Can you stand?"  
"...Krische's fine."  
  
She answered and stood up.  
She was drenched in sweat and blood, her gaze vacant.  
Her appearance had changed from the monster spreading death to that of a
girl, but she definitely didn't look fine.  
  
"Bald Eagle, retreat…."  
  
She began to speak, then coughed and hastily rubbed her back.  
Her small back was unbelievable compared to her previous appearance.
When I approached, the top of her head was about the same height as my
chest, which wasn't particularly tall.  
  
"Captain! We have orders to retreat!"  
  
I shouted instead, and the captain, noticing me, responded. The
child-like girl heard the words, stumbled, and started running—  
  
"U-… …!"  
  
She either tripped or nearly fainted. Krische-sama, who had stumbled,
hit her left shoulder hard against a tree she hadn't dodged. As we
rushed over to her as she crouched there, clutching her left shoulder,
she said,  
  
"...Krische, fine."  
  
She said that, stood up as if nothing had happened, and ran off. We
didn't understand what she meant by fine.  
We exchanged glances, wondering if she meant she was fine because she
wasn't dead, and chased after her unsteady figure.  
  
Even in that state, as usual, Krische-sama ordered us to continue the
delaying tactics.  
Ignoring the captain's strong suggestion, she fell asleep as if she had
fainted.  
  
We were once again left speechless, just watching the young girl. 
<br /><br />

Kalua's words finally brought about the decision to retreat, and we were
finally allowed to descend the mountain. But even as we emerged onto the
grasslands under the moonlight, no one smiled, and everyone anxiously
watched Krische-sama.  
  
"Mia, I'll take over anytime."  
"It's okay, she's surprisingly light."  
  
Mia answered while holding Krische-sama, wrapped in a blanket. Her
pained sleeping face was, by all appearances, not that of a monster or a
prodigy, but a child of her age. A small girl, who somehow ended up on
the battlefield.  
  
I stared at Krische-sama's beloved sword, furrowing my brow.  
The beautiful blade was tattered.  
It was amazing that it hadn't broken, with countless chips in the blade.
The curve was wavy, like a worn-out saw.  
  
The sharp chips were irregular dents caused by the impact of flesh. It
was the result of a single young girl taking hundreds of lives.  
  
"Koza."  
  
When I was asked to hand over the sword, everyone who saw it frowned.
Anyone who handled a sword to any degree would understand the
abnormality. And it wasn't just a matter of skill with a sword.  
  
The reason she had continued to use this curved sword without breaking
it was because she still intended to fight.  
With a body that could barely stand, she intended to kill the enemy
tomorrow.  
Unless someone forcibly stopped her, she would probably continue until
she died.  
  
She was undoubtedly crazy.  
Kalua laughed and said she was mentally ill, and I sincerely believed
it.  
She never gave up anything, never allowed herself to give up. Sense of
responsibility and atonement were madness once the line was crossed.  
  
But Krische-sama couldn't see that line.  
  
The general's death was in no way Krische-sama's responsibility, and
even if she had played a part, her achievements more than made up for
it.  
Yet she blamed herself for being useless, and to atone for her
non-existent fault, she would continue even if it meant spitting
blood.  
  
The worst noble lady turned into a mad genius girl.  
If I had to say when that change happened, it was probably on our way
back.  
  
I witnessed Krische-sama's battles many times after that, seeing her
achieve unbelievable results again and again. But seeing her give her
absolute all, that was the first and last time.  
No one said anything, but I think it was simply what we had to do.  
  
Let's make this Bernaich the last one. —As Krische Christand's sword.  
  
I was too embarrassed to ever utter such a cool phrase, but I can
definitely say this much.  
  
From that day on, we fought with the same conviction in our hearts.
