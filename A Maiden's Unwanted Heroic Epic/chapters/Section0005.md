## Chapter 315: Obligation I

Argoshe understood that he was a very ordinary person.   
He wouldn't say he was inferior to others, but he certainly didn't excel
beyond them either.  
  
His younger brother, a year his junior, unlike him, possessed talents
that people envied.  
He had sometimes thought that the Giterns family should be inherited by
his brother, but his father told Argoshe that he was the one to succeed
the family.  
And to his brother, he said to help his elder brother and protect
Giterns and its people together.  
He told them that they were not one and one, but one Giterns.  
His brother rebelled and went to the battlefield seeking fame and
fortune.  
  
*"Let's talk to Father again. ...At least I believe you are worthy to
inherit Giterns."*  
  
He envied his brother's talent, but he also admired it.  
Looking at his brother, he felt he wasn't capable, and he could accept
handing over the family headship.  
  
*"Brother, I've already decided. Don't worry, I'll achieve great deeds
and return safely. When I do, let's have a good drink together here
again."*  
  
However, his brother seemed determined.  
Argoshe gave up trying to persuade him and reluctantly sent him off
because his brother had talent.  
He thought that if it was his brother, he would achieve great deeds as
he said and eventually make a name for himself as a great general.  
That's what he thought.  
  
But his brother lost his life easily in his first battle.  
His brother, whom Argoshe couldn't help, had unluckily clashed with the
enemy's main force in the war against Elderant and was cut down by a
fierce enemy warrior.  
  
*"...You must not dream, Argoshe. In the time you spend dreaming, there
are endless things you should do and are expected to do. There are many
obligations within your reach that will not end even if you spend your
entire life on them."*  
*"Obligation..."*  
*"Yes, don't misunderstand. Your life is not for yourself alone."*  
  
Witnessing the effortless collapse of the talent he admired had a
significant impact on Argoshe thereafter.  
There were those above, and then even higher above them.  
The world was vast, and he was too small.  
  
He would simply and earnestly do what he had to do.  
Within his reach, to the best of his ability.  
Simply to fulfill his obligation as a noble.  
  
"—No, but, I was truly impressed by Marquis Giterns back then. That
back, walking so confidently alone towards the dragon..."  
"Indeed. For a while after that, even walking through the streets, it
was all talk about the Marquis. I even memorized a song about it."  
"Be careful how you refer to it here. It's the Holy Spirit, not a
dragon. And as I've said many times, it wasn't the heroic act people say
it was. My legs were trembling."  
  
Entering Arna and climbing the mountain path to Kre'Sharana, the escorts
spoke of Argoshe.  
The story of Argoshe, fearfully walking alone towards the dragon, had
now spread from the fortress soldiers to the common people.  
The tale grew with embellishments, becoming quite exaggerated, about a
brave noble who feared not even a dragon for the sake of his people.  
  
It was pleasing to receive such respect from the populace, but being
elevated beyond reality was undesirable.  
Argoshe's virtue lay in his earnestness; he was a timid, ordinary man.  
He was fundamentally different from the heroes who left their names in
history, and there was a proper measure for things.  
  
"That's the same for everyone. There aren't many people who can walk
alone in such a situation."  
"I merely fulfilled my obligation as a noble. It's nothing especially
praiseworthy. ...It's good to talk, but pay attention to your
surroundings."  
  
They were long-serving escorts, people he knew well.  
They were capable and skilled, but their excessive chattering was their
only flaw.  
  
"They say they hardly appear on this path, but this is still a mountain
infested with magical beasts."  
"Understood."  
  
In the mountains centered around Arbyagel, countless magical beasts
existed.  
It seemed that their concentration was a bit lacking, so he emphasized
the point that if they encountered even one of these beasts on the
mountain path, they would have to be prepared to die.  
A magical beast could easily wipe out a century.  
The probability of death for Argoshe and his ten escorts would be
higher.  
  
Only Alberinea could calmly climb the pathless mountains, hunting
magical beasts as she went.  
Even on a relatively safe path, they should not let their guard down.  
  
"Marquis, the sky."  
"Hm?"  
  
Through the trees, a large wing appeared in the sky.  
It was a Griffin—a Gryphon Knight. A stout man landed a little ahead,
creating a strong gust of wind.  
  
"Giterns-dono, it's been a long time."  
"Bege-dono... Have you come to meet me?"  
"Coincidentally, this area is currently my responsibility. The Warrior
Chief also told me to guide Giterns-dono if he came."  
  
He spoke with a slight accent but in common western tongue—he was one of
those who had visited Alberan with Vinthril recently.  
  
"I'm glad you're safe. I heard you went to battle..."  
"Everyone, mostly... I lost one beloved steed, but no one was seriously
injured. Well, I fought alongside Krische-sama, so I suppose it's thanks
to her."  
  
Bege calmed the horse, which was showing fear of the griffon, then gave
a wry smile and dismounted.  
  
"Linz, you walk ahead."  
  
Kre'Sharana's words.  
"Kyu-kururu," it cried out in a high-pitched voice unsuited to its brave
appearance. The griffon named Linz, closing its wings, walked a little
ahead of Bege.  
As Argoshe dismounted and approached, Bege also walked beside him.  
  
"It's a steep mountain path. Don't worry about me, get on your horse."  
"It's a long-awaited reunion... It would be rude to speak from
horseback. Don't mind me, I'm quite sturdy on my feet. You all are
fine."  
  
He addressed the escorts who were about to dismount after Argoshe.  
Then he gazed at the griffon's back.  
Five feet at the shoulder, graceful blue wings, and a lion-like
physique.  
And a raptor-like beak.  
As commanded just now, the griffon walked a little ahead.  
  
"However... I've thought this before, but they are intelligent
creatures."  
"More so than horses, somewhat... they are said to be beasts closer to
magical beasts. If you train them from a young age, they can understand
human speech to some extent. It would be terrible to be dropped from the
sky, so we'd be in trouble if they didn't."  
"It seems training them is still quite difficult."  
"Yes... Her Majesty the Queen seems interested, but while taming them is
one thing, training them is difficult. I don't really want to say it,
but some of them dislike it, and that's a big problem too."  
"Indeed."  
  
Griffins were their lifeline.  
There would be resistance to teaching their training and breeding
techniques.  
He recalled the Queen's face—the beautiful features of a young girl, and
her purple eyes.  
  
*"For now, let's start with light cultural exchange. We can offer
anything they are interested in for free. If we ask for compensation
after that, what should be prioritized above all else is magic
crystals... As for griffins, please keep it to a small request."*  
*"A request...?"*  
*"Yes. Rather than demanding only magic crystals, which will increase in
demand, asking for magic crystals instead of griffins will cause less
psychological resistance, won't it? Well, either way, there's no
particular hurry. The important thing is to bridge the gap first; I'll
leave it to you."*  
  
He couldn't tell what she was seeing or what she was thinking. It was
certain that Queen Kreschenta was a formidable presence, but at least
from observing her interactions with her daughter, she seemed to be
doing quite well.  
Gratitude for gratitude—no matter what, since he was entrusted with
this, he had to achieve results.  
  
"You said you wanted to stay in the settlement this time... Are you
interested in that?"  
"That's part of my role, but my true intention is to experience your
culture firsthand. The gap between Kre'Sharana and Alberan is
significant... Before formal exchanges begin, I want to get to know you
well."  
"...I see, typical of Giterns-dono. However, it will be quite an
inconvenient life compared to comfortable living on the plains..."  
"I am aware of that. Unless I experience it firsthand, I won't be able
to see the culture, the harshness of life, or what they truly desire."  
  
There would be many cultural frictions.  
Their way of life, everything was different.  
Even if they wanted to start an exchange, they couldn't even touch it if
they couldn't see the other side.  
First, to know—that was the purpose of this trip.  
  
"You're a serious person. It might be rude to say this, but you truly
are unusual."  
  
Bege, who heard this, opened both hands in exasperation.  
"Unusual" was a familiar word to him.  
  
"That is my obligation."  
  
With a wry smile, Argoshe replied as usual. 
<br /><br />

  
The journey after that lasted about three days.  
A distance that a griffon's wings could cover in less than half a day
round trip.  
Although he felt bad for making them accompany him, he decided to accept
their kindness, as it was better to have a guide.  
  
Along the way, he asked about how to make a safe sleeping place against
magical beasts.  
He was taught about edible fruits and wild plants.  
Apparently, survival skills had been drilled into them since childhood,
in case they lost their griffon in the mountains.  
  
There were many places without water, and basically, moving through the
mountains involved replenishing water with fruits, so a juicy fruit
called 'tokkle' was highly valued.  
It was faintly sweet with no peculiar taste, and the fist-sized, hard
fruit was full of moisture.  
  
Consuming water from fruits also seemed to be due to the danger of water
sources.  
Many magical beasts claimed watering holes as their territory, so he
advised not to approach them without a griffon.  
He then warned that if they saw fresh, crushed tokkle fruits, they
should leave the area immediately.  
Tokkle fruits hung from slightly high branches, and those that ate them
were usually magical beasts—meaning it was their territory.  
  
As expected, what particularly intrigued him were the stories about
guarding against magical beasts.  
He had heard about mountain activities from those knowledgeable about
the mountains beforehand, but they considered things based on magical
beasts, not just ordinary beasts.  
  
For example, while beasts fear fire, magical beasts do not.  
And magical beasts that know humans understand that humans are near
fire.  
Building a campfire to avoid beasts is counterproductive; in some cases,
it will attract magical beasts.  
However, not building a campfire would attract other beasts, so it
depended on the situation—even if it's just a bear, tiger, or wolf, it
was still easy to be killed.  
  
Therefore, when camping, one must always mix in something called
"protective incense wood."  
It apparently has a scent that paralyzes their noses, and unless one is
very unlucky, they won't approach an area with this scent.  
However, after seeing prey, they will approach regardless, so campfires
should be dug a little and kept small so as not to be seen.  
Bege said that at night, one should not stand up or stick one's head out
of the bushes.  
The fire might serve as a blind for magical beasts with night vision,
but it probably couldn't be used to drive away wolves.  
  
As he listened, he meticulously jotted down every minor detail and
recorded his notes, interspersed with his own observations.  
He gained a deep understanding of the accumulated wisdom over the years
– various aspects that clearly indicated they were people who built
settlements within the territories of magical beasts.  
Throughout their mountain journey, Bege paid meticulous attention to
even the slightest details, maintaining vigilance even while chatting
and smiling with Argoshe and his escorts.  
  
Bege had always been quite friendly and approachable, and during their
previous trip, he had gotten along well with the escorts.  
They too must have understood the atmosphere conveyed in subtle ways.  
They obediently followed his instructions and refrained from having a
little drink at night.  
  
This mountain was probably like a battlefield for them.  
It must have been something he wanted to avoid, dismounting his griffon
and walking alongside them, so his accompanying them like this was truly
appreciated.  
He had never seen a magical beast except for the Suiko accompanying
Alberinea, but one look would make one understand how terrifying those
monsters were.  
  
The sight of it easily jumping down from the back of the mountain-like
dragon.  
He had been agitated because he had seen Alberinea, but even so, they
were monsters that could never be called mere beasts.   
Alberinea, who reportedly hunted such magical beasts nonchalantly while
traversing pathless mountains, and Argoshe, were different.  
Their lives, spent with such monsters, must indeed be very harsh.  
  
"My thanks again, Bege-dono. You've been a great help."  
  
As the entrance to the settlement came into view, Argoshe spoke to
him.  
  
"It's just returning the favor for your previous guidance. Thanks to
you, I had a very enjoyable journey."  
"No, I made you accompany me on a dangerous journey... Cax."  
"Yes."  
  
The called escort—Cax—brought a bottle of alcohol from the carriage.  
  
"It's a small token, unworthy of this favor, but... it's good drink.
Please accept one."  
"I cannot accept it. Guiding you is my natural duty."  
"You taught us much more than just escorting."  
  
Bege scratched his head, looking troubled, and averted his gaze.  
Then he whispered,  
  
"Receiving such expensive-looking things often causes various troubles,
you see. It's the teaching of Kre'Sharana to value a simple, honest
life."  
"I see..."  
"So, I'd be happy if you could give it to me when I visit tonight..."  
"Haha, Bege-dono, a lover of alcohol, has it tough too. Understood.
Then, let's savor it at that time."  
  
And so, with Bege, they proceeded further into the settlement.  
If the men were half-naked, the women were dressed like they were in
underwear—it would take some time to get used to it.  
Their gazes held curiosity, slight caution, and aversion. Especially
strong on the men's side.  
  
"I apologize. It seems many still show reluctance toward exchange with
Alberan... If it were Krische-sama..."  
"Naturally. A separation of centuries. It cannot be resolved
overnight."  
  
The villages were mainly constructed like wooden huts, with few earthen
walls.  
Perhaps due to the slightly higher humidity, there was a small elevated
space under the eaves, and every house had a small set of stairs.  
Children, boys and girls mixed, seemed to be engaged in unarmed combat
training, and it was likely that they would start specializing in
different jobs as they grew older.  
A little further away, in an open space, only young men and boys were
practicing with spears.  
Girls of similar age were sorting wild vegetables and fruits they'd
gathered with other women, or butchering animals and doing laundry.   
The scene was similar to what you'd see in any village.  
  
The only unusual thing, if you could call it that, was that almost all
the men weretraining.  
  
"…So, the men of Kre'Sharana are largely divided into warriors and
squires, is that right?"  
"Yes. Those there are squire apprentices—those who don't become squires
and pass eighteen can never become warriors or squires. Everyone is
desperate."  
"What happens if they don't make it?"  
"They become craftsmen. They make weapons, build houses... The problem,
to put it simply, is that they're not popular. Many spend their lives
unmarried."  
  
"The idea is that men who cannot fight have no value," Bege said.  
  
"This is even an improvement... Apparently, in the past, only warriors
were allowed to marry. Now, if the woman accepts, even a squire or a
craftsman can have a wife, but..."  
"I see. Not many, then."  
"It's common for them to be judged as spineless, unable to even become
squires. At the very least, the trial isn't that difficult."  
  
Bege said, pointing to the surrounding forest with his finger.  
  
"There is only one opportunity. By the time you turn eighteen, you enter
the forest alone and hunt one beast, or three small ones, and bring them
back. There's no time limit; if you have the will, you can spend a month
in there until you hunt a beast... that's the trial."  
"Even so, it's a forest with magical beasts, isn't it?"  
"Those who fear death and run back will abandon their comrades and flee
when it matters most... If you train your mind and body, learn from the
great predecessors, and have the resolve, nine out of ten will return.
Of course, there are unfortunate ones."  
  
Then, he pointed to a hut a little distance from the center of the
settlement.  
The village was mostly wooden, but that one had earthen walls as its
main feature.  
The sound of steel being hammered echoed, indicating that craftsmen were
likely there.  
He saw a man with a limp.  
  
"Killed by magical beasts, or having arms and legs eaten... No matter
how much you train and learn, in the end, it's fate. No one can overcome
nature. Well, there are some like Alberinea, I suppose... Oh, that's the
chieftain's house."  
  
It must be a little secluded from the center of the settlement.  
Right next to a large wooden structure where women carried butchered
game.  
A relatively large, but not quite a mansion, building seemed to be the
chieftain's house.  
  
The only discernible mark was an aged red band wrapped around each of
the four corners of the roof.  
It was nothing compared to a noble's residence; it was the village
chief's house.  
That was the chieftain's house in Kre'Sharana.  
  
The population of Kre'Sharana was, at most, equivalent to a single town
in Alberan—but even so, it seemed modest.   
Nevertheless, hearing that the chieftain lived in a small house that
wasn't immediately recognizable caused a slight surprise.  
  
The appearance of a house doesn't just exist for luxury.  
It's for showing authority.  
Many common people judge status by the extravagant mansions of nobles
and distinguish the people living there as special beings.  
Whether they like or dislike it, they acknowledge them as figures above
them, to whom they should direct their admiration.  
  
There's a clear difference in roles and status between nobles and
commoners.  
From their demeanor to what they wear, including the houses they live
in, they embody nobility, and that's why commoners find it acceptable to
obey nobles.  
No one would humble themselves and obey the poor.  
  
However, in Kre'Sharana, they truly place no value whatsoever on
external nobility.  
All their authority rests solely on a title, on the name of chieftain.  
This was deeply ingrained as culture among all the people of this
land.  
Even this one thing showed a great difference.  
  
"It's been a long time, Giterns-sama. Welcome."  
  
A black-haired girl, helping to carry various things among the women,
noticed him and hurried over.  
It was Kre'Sharana's Holy Spirit Priestess—Lira Sharana.  
Like the other women, she wore simple wrapped cloth and a loincloth.  
She smiled radiantly and bowed her head, and he, too, bowed deeply to
her.  
  
"It has been a while, Priestess. ...I had heard, but even someone like
the Priestess truly works."  
"Yes, except for ceremonies and festivals, I'm no different from anyone
else."  
  
She chuckled softly, and greeted Cax and the other guards.  
Her attire being what it was—Cax and the others looked awkward, lowering
their heads and looking straight into the air. Looking more like guards
than usual.  
  
"I have tea prepared. The chieftain is inside as well... You must be
tired from your long journey. Please, come in."  
"Your words are most kind... However, with this many of us, we would be
a bother. Cax, you all wait outside."  
"Yes, sir."  
  
Lira, with her feminine figure and this attire, was also well-groomed in
appearance.  
Although she had worn furs the other day, it was a bit too stimulating
for the people of Alberan.  
Cax and the others, of course, would not intentionally direct impolite
glances at the Miko during their greeting with the chieftain, but he
wanted to be extra careful regardless.  
The unconscious cannot be underestimated.  
  
"Uh, being a bother, you mean..."  
"Lira-sama. If that's the case, I'll show them around the settlement a
bit. They must be nervous in an unfamiliar land... Of course, if
Giterns-dono wishes."  
  
In place of the puzzled Lira, he probably understood his intention.  
Bege said with a wry smile, and Argoshe bowed his head.  
  
"Ah, yes. In that case... Please do, Bege."  
"Yes."  
  
He thanked him, and Bege, as if saying "don't worry about it," smiled
cheerfully and led the guards away.  
Lira, seeing them off with a smile, invited Argoshe into the house.  
  
He had learned a little about their culture and etiquette beforehand.  
When he unbuckled his beloved sword from his sword belt, Lira smiled
slightly in surprise and accepted it.  
He took off his boots and lined them up at the entrance, then stepped
onto the wooden floor.  
It wasn't a culture where one walked indoors with shoes, like in
Alberan, but such customs were common in rural villages.  
It wasn't so strange.  
It was relatively common in lands that didn't use chairs.  
  
He was guided through one sliding door into the back, where an old man
sat in a formal kneeling posture.  
He had a shaved head and a rich white beard. He wore baggy trousers and
gaiters, and furs draped over his shoulders, but through the gaps, one
could see a well-trained physique that seemed unnatural for an old
man.  
He was a truly imposing old man.  
  
The man, who had been looking at a wooden tablet, quietly turned his
gaze to him and bowed slightly.  
Hesitating with what to do, Argoshe knelt down on both knees where he
was and offered a similar bow.  
Although he had learned a fair amount, there were many details of the
etiquette he didn't know.  
  
"I am Argoshe Wikel Giterns, Marquis of the Kingdom of Alberan. To you,
Chieftain Alkierence, thank you for permitting our stay here."  
"Vinthril spoke of you. He said your sincerity helped him greatly the
other day... then it is only natural. One cannot be disloyal to one's
benefactor. Please, make yourself at ease... and take that seat."  
"Yes."  
  
He stood up and knelt again on the cushion indicated.  
In front of Argoshe, instead of a teacup, a rustic teacup was placed.  
It was a kind of herbal tea, not black tea—he bowed his head, and then a
heaping pile of cookies was placed next to it.  
It was a mountain in a large bowl.  
Was this Kre'Sharana's way of entertaining guests—he felt a slight
confusion and looked at Lira, who smiled shyly.  
  
"I thought everyone would be coming, so, um, I made a lot..."  
"I-I see... Forgive my impertinence."  
  
Such etiquette was difficult.  
Some would say it was proper to take one bite as a matter of politeness,
while others would say reaching for sweets before important discussions
was out of the question.  
Alkierence watched him silently, sipping his tea, and Lira smiled
expectantly.  
  
Should he open the conversation, or reach for a cookie?  
After a moment's deliberation, he naturally reached for a cookie and put
one directly into his mouth.  
It tasted like it was made with nuts.  
While the texture was slightly unique, the faint sweetness of honey was
soft.  
  
Alkierence remained silent while he ate.  
Lira continued to smile.  
Was this the right choice, or the wrong one—he swallowed the question,
and then offered a calm, noble smile.  
  
"How is it? I learned the recipe from Bery-sama the other day, and I
hoped it would suit your taste, Giterns-sama..."  
"Yes, very much so. ...It just reminded me of my recent stay in the
capital. My daughter caused you trouble then..."  
"No, no. Anne-sama... fufu, she was very considerate during my stay.
She's a kind person, very much like Giterns-sama."  
"I appreciate you saying that."  
  
He recalled his daughter, who had been a bit too eager, and said this
from the bottom of his heart.  
She gave a wry smile and moved to his right front.  
Alkierence's eyes showed a slight, gentle smile—he was looking at
Lira.  
He was relieved that it seemed to have been the right choice, and
inwardly let out a sigh of relief.  
  
"...You are indeed the person I heard you were. First, I wish to commend
you on the hardships of your long journey."  
"No, no hardship at all. With Bege-dono as our guide, it was a very
educational journey."  
"I appreciate you saying that. Originally, we should have celebrated the
resumption of our relations with a feast... I apologize for not being
able to offer a proper welcome. There are still quite a few who are not
convinced about restoring diplomatic ties with Alberan."  
"Of course. Five centuries of isolation... Even with the bond of
friendship between the Holy Spirit and Alberinea as a catalyst, past
grievances cannot simply be washed away. I believe at least several
decades will be needed."  
"I share the same opinion. And on top of that... when I heard your
offer, honestly, I was grateful."  
  
Alkierence looked directly at him.  
It wasn't an intimidating gaze, but simply one filled with an imposing
aura.  
  
"I have heard about you from Lira and Vinthril who are here, and from
those who accompanied you on the recent journey. Now that I see you, you
are indeed as I heard... a good man."  
"No, that's an excessive evaluation. We even caused significant delays
to your journey due to our unpreparedness."  
"That goes for us too... Though Alberinea gave her permission, she is
who she is. Our visit must have caused considerable trouble, though she
didn't mention it. After all, you were escorting us, barbaric mountain
folk who know nothing of the customs and manners of the plains."  
"Barbaric, you say..."  
  
Alkierence's eyes softened, and he gave a wry smile.  
  
"At the very least, it's true that many saw us that way, and we went to
Alberinea prepared for that. Furthermore, everyone is grateful to you
for treating us as guests and putting your heart into it. ...No matter
how humble you are, the beauty of your being is conveyed even without
words or adornments."  
"...I am grateful for your words."  
"Indeed. And such a person, to bridge the gap between our two nations,
steps into a foreign land alone and tries to approach us. Nothing could
be more welcome and reassuring. Though there will be many
inconveniences, as chieftain, I intend to cooperate as much as possible.
If anything comes up, you can always come to me."  
"Yes...!"  
  
Remaining kneeling, he bowed deeply.  
They were grateful words.  
He had sent a letter requesting a stay of several months to half a year,
but whether it would truly be accepted was fifty-fifty.  
However, receiving such an endorsement from the chieftain provided
immediate relief.  
  
"You said you wished to pitch a tent at the edge of the settlement...
There's an empty hut. It might be cramped for your number, but you can
use it during your stay..."  
"No, we are foreigners... We wish to avoid burdening this land as much
as possible. If you would simply lend us the space, we would like to
live there. As for food, if we are granted permission for foraging and
hunting, we have brought skilled individuals with us."  
"...I won't say no, but... In Kre'Sharana, warriors only hunt. It is
customary for men to deal with death, and women to obtain harvests. I
don't want to say it, but some will despise you."  
"We also intend to cultivate the potatoes we brought during this stay.
Eventually, I believe we will bring scholars specializing in crops...
and they will probably be men as well. As cultural friction is
unavoidable in future exchanges, I want to experience such things
firsthand during this stay."  
  
Alkierence made a grimace and pondered.  
  
"I hear you are a prominent noble with a long history in the kingdom.
It's shameful to admit this, but... not everyone is faithful to the
teachings. Many, while training their bodies, possess immature hearts.
Among such people, there might be fools who utter unbearable insults
towards you."  
"Nobility is not about history or name, but about one's way of being.
Before the obligation at hand, there is nothing unbearable. ...I
appreciate your concern, but please do not worry."  
  
Argoshe smiled and looked directly at him.  
  
"If we believe that a day will come when we can accept all these various
things from each other, then it is a minor matter. ...I swear upon Her
Majesty the Queen and upon this name, I am prepared to dedicate my life
to this endeavor, so that this attempt may serve as an aid in bridging
the divide between our two nations. Rest assured."  
  
They gazed at each other for a while, and then, after a moment,
Alkierence gave a wry smile.  
Then he nodded deeply and replied, "By the Holy Spirit and the sword, I
swear."  
  
"I promise to meet your resolve to the fullest extent possible. If you
need anything, or have any problems, come to me... Lira, for a while,
stay with Giterns-donoand tell him about the settlement and the
forest."  
"Yes! If that is the case, I, too, swear by the Holy Spirit!"  
  
Lira nodded, a charming and pleasing smile on her face.  
  
"Fufu, I look forward to working with you, Giterns-sama. My gratitude
from the other day still hasn't been repaid... Please tell me anything
you don't understand or any inconveniences you encounter. I'll try to
show my face at least once a day during your stay."  
"Thank you, Priestess."  
  
A pure, straightforward smile.  
Perhaps only her black hair resembled her.  
But strangely, he found himself smiling, recalling the face of his
daughter, who was now far away.
