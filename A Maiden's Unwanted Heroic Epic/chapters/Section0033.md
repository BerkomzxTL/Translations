## Chapter 343: Charm II

When Lazura was born, the mansion was quite lively.  
Her father was there, and her two mothers were there, meeting her
face-to-face every day, showering her with affection daily.  
Meals and baths, in the beginning, were with her parents; she naturally
enjoyed those days to the fullest—but for her younger sister, it was a
routine she had never experienced.  
  
Her father loved Lazura and also worried about Bery.  
He brought in various doctors and even some slightly suspicious
sorcerers for his stepmother and Bery. It seemed his finances became a
bit strained from this, so he was always rushing about and wasn't home
often.  
Perhaps that also contributed to things taking a slightly worse turn.  
  
It was unavoidable that her stepmother fell ill and that Bery was quite
frail.  
But Lazura knew there were servants who whispered behind their backs,
"The Argan family declined after Bery Ojou-sama was born," and she
thought that smart child — Bery — must have sensed it too.  
  
"I see... that certainly is concerning."  
"Yes. I've been wondering what I should do for her..."  
  
The blonde young man speaking in the garden was Bogan, a man from the
Christand family, who had long ties with the Argan family and was now
its head.  
It was the first time Lazura had seen his face since her stepmother's
funeral. The face she saw after a long time was much more refined.  
  
When she first met him, he had the aura of a slender, handsome youth,
but now he had grown much taller, gained muscle, and had the air of a
warrior. It might be because he had finished his first campaign; his
eyes seemed sharper than before, yet his gentle demeanor remained
unchanged.  
  
"...I'm sorry, Bogan-sama, you must be going through much more. I heard
your mother is still bedridden from the shock."  
"The Christands are a family of warriors. Don't worry about it. It's a
shame about my father and the others, but they achieved a splendid end
as nobles. There's no need to grieve, and I've safely been granted
succession to the peerage by His Majesty, so a weight has been lifted
from my shoulders. Listening to your story like this is also a good
diversion for me."  
  
Bogan smiled.  
  
"Moreover, on the battlefield, I had an invaluable encounter with
Captain Gallen. He's not a noble, nor can he manipulate magic, but he
will surely become a general someday. He's someone I feel certain
following him would be the right path. It's not all bad things. If my
father were here, rather than grieving, he would rejoice in such
encounters and laugh, telling me to enjoy the present."  
  
Bogan, who spoke from the heart, was truly a strong person. She had
heard that the war with Elderant, which had continued for several years
until recently, was quite brutal.  
They had ultimately pushed back and reached a peace agreement, but many
soldiers had died. Among the families they associated with, there were
people grieving the death of a son in battle, and his father and brother
also died in battle—only he, who was stationed elsewhere, apparently
survived in the Christand family.  
  
Nevertheless, his eyes, which showed no trace of darkness, shone
brightly, making him a strong and captivating person. If their ages had
been a little closer, perhaps talks of marriage could have occurred, but
Lazura was still a 12-year-old child, and Bogan was an adult.  
Furthermore, even if he were a noble, if he were a civil servant, it
would be one thing, but he was a military noble with the rank of
corporal fighting on the front lines. Given the high risk of death in
battle, it would take courage to marry one's daughter to such a person,
and even though it was the Christand family with whom they had ties
since the previous generation, her father would likely not wish it.  
If she became a widow, her options would diminish, and if his brother
had been alive previously, the possibility of him being adopted into
their family was not zero, but as he was now the head of the Christand
family, he couldn't be adopted. If such a person were her future
partner—a faint budding love was intertwined with resignation.  
  
"I'm fine. More importantly... it's about your sister. Even if she's
frail, spending years in her room must be hard. Why don't you try having
her learn something with you?"  
"Have her learn..."  
"Of course, starting with things she can do in her room... even just
listening to your lessons from the side would be fine. Meeting and
talking with new people, listening to them, and feeling the outside
breeze might change some things. They say illness comes from the mind,
but... actually, for us magic users, the influence of the mind on the
body is said to be strong. If she develops an interest in the outside
world, her body might naturally improve as well."  
"...I see."  
  
Indeed, staying confined to that room probably wasn't good.  
Perhaps having her meet a tutor, not just Lazura and the mansion's
servants, might be one approach.  
  
"Mold grows in closed rooms, and stagnant water rots. If there's no
change, it will only get worse. I can't definitively say it will resolve
her issues as it's her personal problem... but I believe the role of
those around her is to open a small window and let the wind through."  
"...Yes."  
"Don't worry, if you, with your brightness, care for her and spend time
with her, she'll surely be alright. Those who stand as guides must
always show a smile. This isn't just for soldiers."  
  
Lazura was patted on the head and smiled, nodding.  
"That's right. You might be correct. ...I'll try my best."  
"Ah. I should be heading back soon. My vacation is over... and there's
talk of Elderant making unsettling moves. I need to re-train myself for
the time I rested."  
"...Will there be another war?"  
"Probably so. Likely not in the distant future... but don't worry. As I
said, my Centurion is the best. I will definitely return alive and show
my face again."  
"....Yes. I'll be waiting for you."  
  
As she answered, he gave a powerful smile and a salute, pointing to his
chest with his thumb.  
Their reunion was nearly four years later. 
<br /><br />

  
Indeed, her sister would need an opportunity to know the outside
world.  
Perhaps it would be good if she could be told about something beyond the
view from her window, which was all she could see from that room.  
  
Lazura forcibly brought Bery, who looked anxious about being a bother,
out of her room, had her sit beside her, and they attended lessons
together.  
Given their age difference, Lazura's lessons were quite advanced.  
Lazura, acting like a big sister, thought Bery would surely be clueless
and planned to teach her various things, but the difference in ability
was cruel.  
In mathematics, Bery was already the one teaching from day one; in
languages and law, she was quickly surpassed, and by homework time,
Lazura was being tutored by her younger sister.  
Even with board games, on the very day Lazura taught her the rules, she
ended up having to be wary of Bery beating her.  
  
Even when Lazura secretly prepared beforehand, concerned for her pride
as an elder sister, Bery still surpassed her.  
The plan to take care of her studies as an older sister quickly fell
apart, and it didn't even take three months for Lazura to give up,
accepting it as "just the way it is."  
There are some opponents you just can't beat, no matter how hard you
try.  
How many people in the kingdom, she wondered, could possibly beat this
sister in intelligence?  
Thinking about it made competing itself seem foolish, so she readily
gave up such contests.  
  
But as Bogan said.  
Little by little, Bery's expression seemed to brighten.  
Her subtle, quiet, soft smiles—a faint, beautiful, and adorable way of
smiling.  
When Lazura showed her face, Bery's eyes would gently soften, like a bud
softly peeking its inner self.  
  
"What are you reading?"  
"A book I borrowed from Professor Rubel the other day."  
  
It had been a little over a year since then.  
She had grown taller, but her usual spot was still on the bed.  
With a book spread open on her lap, she skillfully spun a coin with the
fingertips of her left hand.  
A hand fidget—she often did that when she was deep in thought.  
  
The coin spun vividly between her fingers, round and round.  
Lazura had initially taught her in order to show off, but Bery quickly
mastered it, and now she spun it flawlessly even while looking down at
her book.  
  
Bery was clever and skilled, but that wasn't all.  
It was a bit different from "effort," but her concentration on learning
something was immense. On the day Lazura taught her the coin trick, she
kept spinning the coin with her fingers all night long afterward.  
  
"...Somehow, I just couldn't stop thinking about not being able to do it
perfectly."  
  
The next day, Bery, who had a fever, apologized to Lazura, who was
tending to her in exasperation.  
Lazura sometimes wondered if Bery lacked concepts like getting bored or
tired.  
  
Studying or practicing something is a continuous struggle.  
Of course, there are times when it's interesting, and it's fun when you
get results, but the time spent struggling is probably longer.  
But when Bery can't do something well, or doesn't understand something,
she simply immerses herself in it.  
Indeed, it was something a little different from effort.  
  
She probably wasn't even doing it because she particularly liked it.  
She probably didn't even have a specific goal of how she wanted to be.  
She just did it to be able to do what she couldn't, to understand what
she didn't.  
It might be a sensation like eating because one is hungry.  
Though, for Bery, such desires might be irrelevant anyway.  
  
On the bedside table lay another book.  
Her father's collection on the engraving of magic crystals.  
The biggest change recently was that Bery had started leaving her room
voluntarily.  
Just going to her father's study to get a book—it was a small thing, but
a big step and a good change.  
  
Rubel was the tutor who visited the mansion.  
He was a mathematics teacher, but also a magician, and for a time he had
seriously studied under a master in the royal capital, and had even
published some related books.  
The book Bery held was also one he had written.  
  
Mathematics and magic seemed completely different but were apparently
quite close fields.  
He seemed to highly value Bery's mathematical talent, and if she was
interested, he lightly lectured her on the basics of spell engraving,
and was enthusiastic.  
Being physically frail would surely bring many hardships, but the path
of scholarship is open to anyone.  
His encouragement that "there are many scholars and magicians who
achieved greatness despite being sickly" was also a big factor, and it's
likely one of the reasons Bery started to show brighter expressions.  
  
He used to praise Lazura a lot, but now he was completely absorbed in
Bery, who had been a bonus—Lazura couldn't help but feel a little
something about it, but it wasn't a big deal.  
She also felt happy, as if it were her own achievement, to see her
sister's talent, which she had discovered, being recognized in this
way.  
  
Bery's gaze, fixed on the book, was in that familiar state.  
She turned pages as if the world consisted only of the book and herself,
gazing at the descriptions of the spell formulas.  
It was her face when she was immersed.  
That she could calmly spin a coin in such a state was beyond Lazura's
comprehension.  
  
"Ah..."  
"Onee-sama's here, so intermission!"  
  
When Lazura took away the book and coin, Bery looked surprised.  
Lazura glared at her sister.  
  
"Honestly, you haven't been staying up late, have you?"  
"Um..."  
  
Bery's eyes darted away, and Lazura sighed.  
Then, looking at the page she had opened, Lazura frowned.  
It was a level of spell description completely incomprehensible to
Lazura, who only knew the basics.  
  
"...I was just a little curious."  
"Of course, you'd be full of curiosity. I can't believe you can stare at
such gibberish formulas all day long!"  
"Gibberish..."  
"It is gibberish to your Onee-sama. And Professor Rubel didn't tell you
to memorize it, did he? He just gave it to you to introduce that such
advanced formulas exist, right? Do you never feel satisfied unless you
unravel everything in this world just because you're a little
curious?"  
"Well..."  
  
She looked troubled, but in reality, it seemed entirely possible for
this sister.  
With just a, "I was curious," she would forget herself and become
completely engrossed.  
Sighing again, Bery traced her lips with her fingertip, as if deep in
thought.  
Then she looked up at Lazura, appearing anxious.  
  
"Um... are you angry?"  
"I'm not angry, I'm scolding you."  
  
When Lazura sat on the bed and stroked Bery's head, Bery's face relaxed
a little, as if relieved.  
  
"I'm saying this because I'm worried about you. Studying diligently is a
good thing, and I think it's wonderful in itself, but overdoing anything
is strictly forbidden. If you eat plenty, sleep when you're supposed to,
and then study, I'll be at ease too. That's what it means."  
  
When Lazura told her, Bery nodded slightly, and Lazura smiled, stroking
her cheek.  
Softly, smoothly—tracing Bery's lips with her thumb, Lazura leaned
closer and continued.  
  
"I'm not angry. ...I'm scolding you because you're important to me. Do
you understand?"  
  
Bery nodded again, then narrowed her eyes, watching Lazura's fingers and
hand tracing her lips.  
Lowering her long eyelashes and resting her cheek ever so slightly on
Lazura's palm.  
Her slight, clinging movements were irresistibly adorable.  
Lazura then kissed her forehead and smiled, "Good."  
Then she took off her shoes, climbed onto the bed, lifted Bery's light
body, and placed her on her lap.  
  
"You're my little sister, the cutest in the world. Of course, even I
have likes and dislikes, but even if I came to dislike everyone in the
world, I would never dislike you. ...So, don't worry."  
"...Yes."  
  
Lazura gently held her slender, small body and pressed her cheek against
Bery's head. Bery relaxed and leaned into her.  
She didn't ask for it herself, but she felt relieved when Lazura did
so.  
  
A child who struggles to be pampered.  
Children usually feel as if the world belongs to them.  
They're given what they ask for, comforted when they cry, and treated
kindly when they're in pain.  
But for her younger sister, she always put her own wellbeing last.  
  
Perhaps her tendency to immerse herself in something to the point of
physical illness came from this.  
Even desires that one normally can't suppress would be put off for
something else.  
"Because I was curious," "because I didn't understand"—with just such
words, those desires would be pushed aside.  
Even desires like being tired or sleepy would be left until the very
last moment.  
She would immerse herself until she passed out.  
Perhaps her senses were numbed because she had always been in pain since
birth.  
She cared far too little about herself.  
  
Enjoying the feel of her smooth, long hair, Lazura said:  
"It's okay to be more spoiled, Bery. I want to spoil you even more,
until you're completely mushy with pampering."  
"Mushy...?"  
"Yes, mushy. A younger sister listens to her older sister. Since I want
to spoil you, you just have to obey without thinking. Do you dislike
that?"  
  
Bery again traced her lips with her fingertip.  
After a moment, she quietly murmured, "No," and put her hands behind her
back.  
She pulled Lazura's head just a little closer and rubbed her own cheek
against Lazura's.  
Lazura chuckled at her sister's behavior.  
  
"So, what were you curious about?"  
"...I was thinking about the differences in the spell engravings in a
book called 'Mystic Grave Robbers' that was in Father's study. Both are
interlocking formulas using multiple magic crystals... similar to the
mechanism used in conduits for a bath."  
"...A bath?"  
"Yes. It's a structural part that combines formulas for drawing in water
via pressure changes, and temperature changes and monitoring... a bath
is just an example; it's a spell that can be applied in various ways...
but I was curious about the slightly different approach—"  
  
And so, she continued to state her observations.  
Bery's talk, at around seven years old, was that of a scholar.  
Lazura could only understand the introductory parts; when it came to the
serious discussion, she was completely lost.  
Yet, unable to stop her sister, who seemed just a little bit happy,
Lazura gave appropriate nods and stroked her head.  
  
Bery's mother—Lazura's stepmother—had a similar aura.  
When she was alone, she was always gazing at a book in a sunny spot.  
That book, too, was probably originally hers.  
Her father liked books to some extent, but he had no interest in
magic.  
  
The sight of her stepmother silently, intelligently following text with
her eyes was beautiful even to Lazura's young eyes, and when Lazura
asked silly questions, she would always smile gently and answer them
fluently.  
To Lazura at the time, her stepmother seemed to know everything in the
world.  
Lazura, who originally didn't like studying, became motivated because
she admired her stepmother.  
  
Bery probably had almost no memories of her own mother.  
But their aura was truly so similar; it felt strangely like they were
parent and child.  
Lazura toyed with Bery's smooth, long hair with her fingers and pressed
her lips to it.  
Her sister was just a beautiful child.  
If she looked outward just a little more, if something surrounding her
changed just a little more, she would surely become a wonderful woman
like her mother.  
  
"...I couldn't do anything motherly for that child."  
  
Before she died, her stepmother cried quietly in a nearly inaudible
voice.  
Lazura wished she could tell her someday that there was no need to
regret.  
That her sister had grown into a wonderful woman, just like her.  
  
"—So, um... about earlier... uh..."  
"Getting sleepy?"  
  
Bery's cheeks flushed slightly, and Lazura gave a wry smile.  
  
"That's what you get for staying up late, honestly."  
"Ah, um..."  
  
Saying so, Lazura laid her on the bed and slipped in beside her.  
Gently hugging her sister, Lazura gave a small yawn.  
  
"I got tired listening to your difficult stories too. Your punishment is
to sleep with me... You'll keep Onee-sama company for her nap until I
say it's okay."  
  
Looking into her eyes, Bery looked a little embarrassed.  
She traced her lips with her fingertip—a habitual gesture—and nodded.  
  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."  
"Good."  
  
Bery then leaned in, resting her face on Lazura's chest.  
As soon as she closed her eyes, she fell sleep.  
She must have been very tired.  
  
"...You silly thing."  
  
Lazura quietly chuckled at her sister and closed her eyes, holding her
close.  
Her sister's body was always strangely warm. 
<br /><br />

  
Several days later, the old scholar—the tutor Rubel—came.  
Bery, who seemed to have been looking forward to it, returned his book,
saying, "I learned so much." Rubel smiled cheerfully, looking pleased.  
Smiling wryly that the lesson might end early today due to Bery's
questions, she stepped out of the room to have some cookies prepared and
called out to a servant.  
A little later, when she returned to the room, Bery's question time was
still continuing.  
  
"I think the formula here can also be simplified like this... is there a
reason this was done this way?"  
  
While startled by her words, Rubel observed her, his face a little
stern, as he gazed at the spell formula Bery had written on parchment.  
However, after a moment, Rubel nodded and smiled.  
  
"No, I wrote this book quite some time ago. At that time, I probably
couldn't refine the formula that much yet. ...No, truly, that idea at
your age is truly wonderful."  
"...Thank you."  
  
Seeing him encourage Bery like that, Lazura breathed a sigh of relief.  
Apparently, they were talking about optimizing the spell formula.  
She thought that scholars, who are hungry for knowledge, might get angry
at such a child pointing out flaws. This was especially true because she
had never seen the old scholar Rubel angry since they first met, and she
thought he was a gentle person who also highly valued her sister.  
  
Perhaps at that time, she should have paid a little more attention.  
With humans, there were always areas that should never be touched
upon.  
  
Bery's questions continued for a while, about her doubts about the
formulas.  
It was probably like when she pointed out Lazura's calculation errors;
there was probably no ill intent.  
She thought about it because she was curious, and she asked because she
was curious.  
That was all it was.  
  
For better or worse, her sister never looked down on others.  
She thought that others noticed what she noticed, and others understood
what she understood.  
Vaguely, she seemed to think about things that way.  
A favorable interpretation that there must be some intention behind what
was being done.  
However, for some people, this could be taken as being mocked.  
Even a simple, small mistake was a question to her sister.  
—Because she didn't make mistakes.  
  
Lazura had resigned herself to that.  
Her sister was a genius, much smarter than her.  
Half exasperated, she had accepted it that way and decided not to
compete.  
But, of course, there are people in the world who can't do that.  
Even Lazura hadn't been entirely free of such feelings.  
If something had been just a little different, her feelings towards her
would have been completely different.  
Her sister's talent unknowingly planted feelings of inferiority in
others.  
  
And sometimes, inferiority turns into hatred, easily transforming into
disgust and malice.  
  
"...Mystic Grave Robbers?"  
"Yes. It's a work by Rigels-sama that was in Father's study... and it
describes complex spell formulas similar to yours. But the approach to
the interlocking parts between the magic crystals is quite different, so
it's puzzling... did you deliberately do it that way, Professor?"  
"Deliberately, you say..."  
"It seems you mostly use easy-to-understand basic formulas. It was easy
for me to understand, and I thought you did it that way for a beginner's
introduction."  
  
Opening Rubel's book, she continued.  
With a joyful smile, and with immersed, intelligent eyes.  
  
"For example, this page, if you use an applied formula like Rigels-sama,
would only require three lines of description, and the same goes for
this area. The magic efficiency is also very different... so, is the
reason for deliberately using basic formulas here to ensure redundancy
rather than efficiency?"  
"...A beginner's introduction, huh."  
  
His tone of voice seemed to change, and Lazura, who had been looking
down at the math book, looked up.  
Rubel was smiling quietly, but his aura was clearly different.  
  
"Professor...?"  
"So, you're saying Rigels' description is advanced, and mine is
inferior?"  
"Um, ah, um—"  
"—How is it, then?"  
  
A glaring look and a changed tone of voice.  
Bery flinched, and Lazura froze.  
  
"That's what it is, isn't it? Go on, say it. You're so smart, you want
to say my formulas are clumsy, don't you? Unlike that man's writings, my
books are just for beginners, aren't they!?"  
"Huh..."  
  
He swept the book off the desk and shouted.  
Lazura stood up, frantically embracing the frightened Bery.  
  
"You're making a fool of me, aren't you? Just like him, you were looking
down on me and laughing? Saying I'm a second-rate magician who can't
even understand something this simple?!"  
"P-professor, Bery didn't mean—"  
"How is it!?"  
  
As Rubel slammed the desk, Bery tensed up, and Lazura gripped her
tighter.  
  
"Oh yes, you're right, I am second-rate! I'm a man who was ridiculed and
ran back to his hometown, only fit to be a child's teacher! From a
genius like you, it must be quite laughable, right? Even the only good
thing about me, my intellect, is only at this level, and years of
research are just a beginner's introduction for you!"  
  
His usually smiling face now seeped with an indescribable rage.  
Rubel peered into Bery's face.  
  
"Isn't it laughable? While calling me 'Professor,' were you mocking me
in your heart? Go on, say what you like, I'll tell you it's true...!"  
"N-no..."  
  
Her voice tinged with tears, she shook her head.  
Rubel looked at Bery, then turned his face away, his breathing ragged,
his eyes cast down.  
  
"...There's nothing for you to learn from a second-rate person like me.
I'll be leaving."  
  
After saying that, Rubel left the room.  
Lazura could only watch him go, and could only hug her sister, who was
covering her face.  
  
Perhaps no one was truly at fault.  
Still, such things happen.
