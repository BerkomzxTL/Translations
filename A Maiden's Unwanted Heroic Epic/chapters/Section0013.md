## Chapter 323: \[Theatrical Release\] Magical Girl Magical☆BeryーCDN ~Exorcist☆Shelna and the Threat Transcending Time and Space~

*AN: I was sad that the Anne side story didn't feel right, so from now
on I'll be incorporating cosmic horror and magical girl elements in a
space setting, and making it into something like Magical Girl
Magical☆Bery CDN (Cosmic Dark Nyururun). I will be serializing this
series!*  
  
*Thank you everyone for your support so far!*  
  
*Please continue to support the Magical Girl Magical☆Bery series if you
like!*  
  
*This was an April Fool's special edition.*  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the dark magic castle, Dark Gilnaria, a fierce battle in the throne
room had caused such destruction that the great hall was beyond
recognition.  
In the center, suspended in mid-air by magical mixers, was the Demon
King Gilgil.  
Facing him were Magical Bery, a battered magical girl in a frilly white
and pink outfit, and Kreschenta, the queen of the fairy kingdom.  
  
"Now! Magical Bery!"  
"Yes, Kreschenta-sama!"  
  
The two stood side-by-side, thrusting out their magical staffs and
shouting.  
Vast magical power surged around them, forming a beautiful pale pink
pattern.  
  
"Seven vices against seven virtues!"  
"The power to believe in peace and people—this is the ultimate magic!"  
"G, uh…"  
  
The power gathered from a three-dimensional magic circle filling all of
space concentrated in Magical Bery's palm. A simultaneous cut-in showed
a flashback of past battles.  
  
"—The final ultimate technique of love and justice, Magical! Love!
Seal!!"  
  
A flash of light filled the screen.  
A roar echoed for a while, then…  
  
"Ah, welcome home, Bery."  
"I'm home. I'm sorry I'm late. I was helping my husband deal with a
problem, and it got this late…"  
  
The one who returned was Bery.  
Unusually, she was dressed in a ladylike tailored suit and carrying
shopping bags.  
She stared, speechless, at the image on the large living room screen.  
Krische, sitting on the sofa watching "Magical Girl Magical☆Bery: The
Movie, Part 2 ~Magical Cooking of Love and Justice~," tilted her head.  
Selene compared the faces of the Magical Bery on screen and the real
Bery with an indescribable expression.  
The Nyururun family and their friends, writhing ecstatically from
excitement as they watched the movie while eating cookies, greeted the
real Bery with wriggling movements.  
  
"You're late, Magical Bery. The ending was already playing while you
were gone."  
"A, uh… w-why, what…"  
"Onee-sama wanted to see it, so I made it viewable here. I'm thinking
about somehow making video works available here in the future—are you
listening?"  
  
Bery's pale face turned bright red.  
She then buried her face in her hands, collapsing.  
  
—Five minutes later.  
  
Bery, still sitting on the sofa, couldn't bring herself to lift her
face. Krische and the tentacles surrounded her, offering
encouragement.  
  
"It's okay, Bery. You're not embarrassing at all. You were incredibly
cool!"  
"T-thank you…"  
  
The tentacles also conveyed something with their wriggling movements,
agreeing with Krische, who tried to cheer Bery up by saying the
Nyururuns were also saying that, but Bery kept her face covered.  
Selene sighed in exasperation, asking what she was embarrassed about
now.  
  
"You were acting like a magical girl with gusto at your age. You were
also enthusiastic about the Demon King role…"  
"That's completely different. …I'm acting for the show now, but back
then, I was a child, and I, you know, seriously, earnestly…believed that
I was a magical girl of love and justice…"  
"This is the ultimate magic."  
"S-stop it…"  
"The final ultimate technique of love and justice."  
"P-please stop…"  
  
Selene laughed happily, watching Bery's reddening face. Bery, tears
welling up from embarrassment, glared at Selene and sighed.  
  
"I was a middle schooler back then, too. Even if Kreschenta-sama
suddenly appeared in front of you, you'd probably have been just like
me."  
"No way. What about this insect makes her look like a user of love and
justice?"  
"I won't let you get away with that! Speaking to the Fairy Queen like
that—"  
  
After Selene pulled out a magical spray from nowhere, Kreschenta, who
had been munching on cookies at the table, immediately scurried onto
Bery's shoulder. Bery, looking troubled, gently picked Kreschenta up and
placed her on her palms.  
  
"Selene-sama. You shouldn't bully Kreschenta-sama too much."  
"You're too kind to that insect."  
  
Selene glared and sighed, then operated the remote, bringing up "Magical
Girl Magical☆Bery: The Movie, Part 1 ~The Birth of the Young Magical
Maid~" on the screen.  
  
—Bery (14) walking to school, silently attending class, and spending her
break without talking to anyone.  
Her quiet demeanor (she was silent until she got home) was shown in
detail, leading into after school. Going home and engaging in
lighthearted conversation with her mother, Lazura, who was still alive;
their first conversation and smile, helping with housework, comforting
the newborn Selene, and finally having dinner with her father; a lengthy
family scene was shown.  
  
The video was sped up to Bery's return to her room, then switched to
normal playback.  
  
'I am Kreschenta, the queen of the fairy kingdom. Consider yourself
honored; you have been chosen by me to be a magical girl.'  
'…Uh'  
  
A small sofa on her desk.  
Bery (14) looked at the insect sprawled on it, rubbing her eyes several
times.  
Muttering about how tired she must be, she looked at Kreschenta again,
confusion dawning on her face.  
Hesitantly, she reached out her hand,  
  
'Yelp!'  
  
A small electric shock from the insect made her quickly clutch her
hand.  
  
'Who said you could touch me? A wingless lower being like you, show some
respect. Normally, you wouldn't even be allowed to speak, let alone look
upon the majesty of me, the queen.'  
'…Y-yes.'  
'Not "yes"! Your apology for your rudeness is still pending.'  
'…I-I'm very sorry.'  
'Hmph, good. From today on, you will be my faithful servant, a magical
girl, and fighting my enemies will be your job. Everything else is
secondary; absolute obedience to my orders.'  
'Uh, but… you can't just suddenly say something like that—!?"  
  
A small lightning bolt erupted from the small body.  
Bery (14) flinched and stiffened, and Kreschenta stated,  
  
'I didn't ask for your convenience. The only acceptable response to the
queen's orders is "yes." You have no choice. …And, this is also for your
sake.'  
'M-my…?'  
'Yes, I'm giving you a chance to protect your family. If you don't
become a magical girl… well, even the newborn baby might not make it.
Evil is approaching.'  
'Such—'  
  
—Selene played this first meeting scene, then turned to Bery (33).  
  
"I can't see any element of love and justice in this insect…wouldn't she
be more on the devil's side?"  
"Well…I thought so, too, when we first met. B-but…you had just been
born, and I thought you might be harmed…I only realized it was just
static electricity a little later… "  
"O-onee-sama, please don't pull my wings! Like I said before, it's
acting, acting… A kind queen befriends the lower being who became a
magical girl and fights evil together—that's the plot!"  
"Krische heard you already knew everything earlier. Were you lying?"  
"I-it wasn't a lie…it was a prank, a prank video…"  
  
Watching Kreschenta, whose wings were being pulled by Krische, Selene
compared Bery (14) on screen with Bery (33) next to her.  
The only difference was their clothes and hair length.  
Even if she were told it was a recently filmed video, there would be no
incongruity.  
As her embarrassment subsided, Bery (33) began to reminisce, saying
things like, "I was young back then," and Selene frowned, saying that
she couldn't see any difference.  
  
"Well, that's fine. But realistically, what do you plan to do in ten or
twenty years? Magical Bery (53) aside, I think the appearance of Ariga
Bery (53) is clearly going to be bad."  
"That's…a rather troublesome problem…but if it becomes too much of an
issue, Kreschenta-sama might prepare a place for me to live in the Fairy
Kingdom…"  
  
"Fairy Kingdom…or rather, Kreschenta. What about me and Krische? I
thought you said aging would slow down…"  
"U-uh…yes. I made your frail bodies strong and long-lasting. Be
grateful."  
"A-anyway…"  
  
Finally freed from Krische, Kreschenta fluttered to Bery's shoulder and
stroked her wings.  
  
"Onee-sama, don't be so angry. Your beloved red hair was also saved from
a sickly fate by becoming a magical girl. If I hadn't made you a magical
girl, you would have died young, and your red hair is very grateful to
me."  
"Died young…"  
"Well…'died young' might be an exaggeration, but you missed a lot of
school…fufufu, it's true that you're grateful to me, Kreschenta."  
  
Bery smiled wryly, hugged the anxious-looking Krische, and stroked her
head.  
Then, she looked at the screen, remembering. On the screen, Kreschenta
was just giving Bery the shockingly pink magical staff.  
Bery spoke, reminiscing.  
  
"…I didn't have any friends, and my sister, my husband, and my daughter
were my only support. Then I met Kreschenta-sama, who asked me to become
a magical girl to protect peace… I, that is, I guess I longed for a more
fantasy-like non-everyday life than my everyday routine. Only when I
fought as a magical girl did I feel… somehow like I could escape from
myself…"  
"That's a bit heavy, and I heard similar lines in the movie, uh…"  
"N-no!"  
  
Bery snatched the remote from Selene, who was about to fast-forward, and
pressed the stop button, her face bright red. She sighed.  
  
This was the climax of "Magical Girl Magical☆Bery: The Movie, Part 1
~The Birth of the Young Magical Maid~".  
Before the decisive battle with the seven powerful evil entities, Bery
(14), lacking confidence, confided her feelings to Kreschenta, was
encouraged, wiped away her tears, and made a resolve; it was one of the
best scenes in the movie.  
Despite their appearance being a blasphemy against life, the crybaby
Nyururuns wasted tissues, and even Selene, who knew the truth about the
magical girl, was moved to tears.  
  
The skillful editing made it a great movie, but in this situation, it's
likely that Bery in that scene wasn't acting—she was genuinely tricked
by the insect.  
Bery, her face red, glared at Selene, saying, "That's terrible."  
  
"…Do you understand, Selene-sama? How it felt to be nationally
broadcast, then made into a three-part theatrical film, crying earnestly
for the sake of my mission as a magical girl…"  
"That's beyond imagination. Honestly, I'd have squashed that insect."  
"I won't let you get away with that—n-no, if you spray now, my red hair
and onee-sama will be caught in the crossfire."  
"You really are the worst creature."  
  
Selene put down the magical spray, and Kreschenta said, "That's rude."  
  
"It was hard for me, too. To somehow deal with my brother who ran away
from me and started operating on Earth, to teach Magical Bery, who
didn't know anything about magic, from scratch. Plus, I spent a lot of
money on bribes to powerful people and had to take care of the public at
the same time."  
"…"  
"That's why I made 'Magical Girl Magical☆Bery'. I couldn't expect a
convincing performance from an amateur. I put a lot of effort into
making it a documentary-style demon-slaying entertainment…"  
"It's entirely for your convenience."  
  
Selene said in exasperation.  
From their perspective, they didn't care about the Fairy Kingdom's
convenience. Although they were told that the world was in danger if
Bery and the others didn't fight, it was very doubtful whether such an
impact really existed. Kreschenta kept calling for world peace to use
Selene and the others, but if left alone, the world would probably not
be destroyed.  
That insect is basically exaggerating and lying.  
  
Sighing, she asked Bery,  
  
"Fine. Bery, have you ever been to the Fairy Kingdom?"  
"Yes…uh…Kreschenta-sama invited me to things like autograph sessions,
lectures, and greetings at advance screenings…"  
"Autograph session?"  
"Apparently, your body shrinks when you go there… Well, the atmosphere
is like a near-future sci-fi world. There are all kinds of automated
modern high-rise buildings…"  
"It's more mundane than I imagined."  
  
It was quite different from Selene's image of a pastoral fantasy
world.  
Kreschenta fluttered onto Selene's shoulder like an insect.  
  
"Hmph, are you interested? If you beg me, I'll let you enter."  
"Despite your attitude, I'm a little interested now. I imagined it to be
like a summer thicket with creatures like you everywhere."  
"It's not that different from here. The fairies also look similar except
for their wings…well, how about we all go there for our summer vacation
next month?"  
"You weren't saying that it was troublesome to go there before?"  
"After they've seen this, it's fine now."  
  
Bery sighed, looking at the screen.  
Before, she would avoid the topic of the Fairy Kingdom, saying that
there were many problems with going there, but it seems she just didn't
want them to see "Magical Girl Magical☆Bery."  
Selene wondered why a 33-year-old woman enthusiastically playing a
magical girl was so embarrassed now.  
  
"Well, it's a possible travel destination. The problem is this
insect."  
"Hmph, let go of me!"  
"I'm warning you, I'm not going to any autograph sessions or
lectures."  
  
Selene glared at Kreschenta, who flapped her wings, struggling against
her grip.  
  
"I-I wasn't thinking about that! What are you going to do!?"  
"We'll see."  
  
Sighing, she let go, and Kreschenta recoiled and looked behind her.  
  
"What about the Nyururuns?"  
  
She asked, and the Nyururuns looked at each other, wriggling and
discussing something. Then they turned to Krische, conveying something
while swaying their tentacles.  
  
"It seems they'll be staying home because bringing so many tentacles is
too much of a nuisance."  
"Well, bringing dozens of tentacles is a bit much."  
  
The Nyururuns wriggled their tentacles and bowed.  
They were as understanding as ever.  
  
"You can stay home as usual, but don't cause any trouble for Father.
Don't do anything strange, okay?" 
<br /><br />

  
"Ah, sorry. I've caught a summer cold… I've contacted Nozan and
Sarchenka. Tell Kokys people that a visit is unnecessary."  
'Yes, sir. I'll call you immediately if anything happens…Selene and the
others are going on a trip.'  
"I know. Then…"  
  
Turning off the call, Bogan sat back on the living room sofa and placed
his phone on the table.  
His temperature was almost 39 degrees—he had a terrible headache and
aching joints.  
He had no appetite, and he looked up at the ceiling.  
  
"Good timing, or bad...?"  
  
His work was so busy that he hardly ever went home.  
Overwork led to a summer cold, and just as he was planning to spend a
couple of days at home resting, Selene and the others went on a trip.  
All alone in this large mansion, he felt a profound loneliness.  
It was fortunate that Selene and the others didn't catch his cold, too,
but his weakened body made his spirit weak as well. It was only human
nature to wish someone were there.  
  
"Hm...?"  
  
He inadvertently glanced down and see purple dogs that appeared at some
point while he was resting. His pets, named Nyururun, —one of them was
carrying a cooling sheet for a fever in its mouth.  
  
"Ah, there you are. Thank you...you're clever dogs."  
  
He pet their heads, and they licked him; it tickled.  
He didn't know their breed, but they were friendly and intelligent, good
children.  
There were now over ten of them; He really took in a lot of dogs, but
they were so easy to care for and so clever that even he had no
complaints. He left the housework entirely to Bery —basically, he leave
everything to the three of them.  
  
"..."  
  
As he applied the cooling sheet to his forehead, he noticed ginger tea
had been prepared on the desk.  
Did the dogs make the ginger tea? His hazy mind felt a sense of
incongruity, but it was certainly helpful. He take a sip of the ginger
tea, sighed in relief, and reclined onto the sofa.  
  
"Thank you. I'll rest a bit."  
  
His consciousness was hazy. He was exhausted.  
He rested my forehead on his arm and closed his eyes; a blanket was
draped over him.  
  
He silently expressed his gratitude to the intelligent dogs and fell
asleep as if fainting—  
The tentacles watching observed this, their bodies writhing as their
faces (they only had faces) turned to each other.  
  
—Our Great Lord is afflicted with illness, nearing death.  
A sense of tension ran through them because of this abnormal
situation.  
  
Their master, Bery, and the princess, Selene and Krische's father.  
Bogan was like an emperor to them.  
With such a great person falling ill, their anxiety was immense, and
they were thrown into a state of panic, their tentacles writhing
wildly.  
  
One of the tentacles suggested they should call Bery and the princesses
back, but the three were in the fairy world. Three messengers were
chosen to go to them under the orders of Nyururun, the high priest and
caretaker of the mansion, but whether or not they would arrive in time
for this crisis was a gamble, he calmly conveyed with his tentacle. He
climbed onto the desk, swaying his tentacle, continuing that they have
no choice but to offer prayers to their god and pray for the salvation
of their Great Lord, Bogan.  
  
The writhing tentacles conveyed the desperate feelings of the others.
Their god exists in the far reaches of deep space, and his descent
requires a rather large-scale ritual. It's fresh in their memory that
they performed the descent ritual last year to cure Princess Selene's
serious illness (diagnosis: cold) and received a sermon.  
Disobeying Princess Selene's command, "Don't do it again," was an
unforgivable sin.  
Everyone understood that it could result in her wrath and expulsion from
this paradise.  
  
Nyururun trembled and closed its single, round eye.  
  
'Yes...Ehehe, let's call you Nyururun.'  
  
The image that came to mind was the frail child, Princess Krische's kind
face giving him a name and a cookie.  
  
'Nyururun. This is it, press this button...'  
  
And Bery, who taught Nyururun various things as a servant, provided
education, guidance, and even a large habitat for the tentacles.  
  
'Ha...I understand. Do as you like. It's not like one or two tentacles
anymore...I mean, I want to ask, how many children do you have...?’  
  
Selene, who, though strict, granted Nyururun's whims and accepted his
wife and children.  
  
They were always being shunned and exterminated.  
For Nyururun and others who had no choice but to live as alleyway
tentacles, their days spent with those women were precious memories,
like shining jewels.  
  
Krische and Bery's smiles as they doted on their newborn children.
Nyururun, whose tentacles spread at the sight of their incredibly
energetic and lovely children (note: larvae resembling terrifying
caterpillars that secrete mysterious mucus from their entire bodies),
was sternly told by Selene to take responsibility as a parent (loose
translation: do not let them run wild). They were spoiled, and sometimes
strictly educated. The things they had been given, from hats and gloves
to their dwelling place, was not just restricted to physical objects.  
Nyururun's existence now depended on their kindness and love.  
  
This was Nyuruslen, the tentacles' paradise.  
A unique paradise filled with their happiness. If they were expelled
from here, how would they live?  
Just imagining it was terrifying, and all their tentacles tremble.  
  
High Priest Nyururun opened its round eyes, then, despite everything,
frantically waved its tentacles.  
  
No matter what happens, they cannot sacrifice the Great Lord's life. If
it comes to it, he will take full responsibility and willingly accept
the punishment.  
  
Moved by his words, the tentacles writhed their entire bodies
(tentacles), their round eyes glistening.  
Even if it means defying death, they will repay their kindness.
Nyururun's attitude was an example of an exemplary tentacle—a model for
all tentacles to emulate.  
  
Nyororon, his best friend, also waved his tentacles, climbing onto the
desk to share the responsibility. He reassured Nyururun with a swaying
of his tentacle, telling him not to worry.  
  
Considering their past kindness, the Great Lord's life and their life
here were invaluable.  
He said this, and continued to gather all the tentacles.  
  
The hearts of the tentacles were now united.  
They will save the Great Lord Bogan, using any means necessary.  
  
—This was the beginning of the Twilight Incident, a story that would
later be talked about for a long time in the human world. 
<br /><br />

  
An unimaginable spacetime vibration, and a vast amount of magical power
seeping from far above.  
Exorcists, spirits, demons, and even humans with refined senses felt
this immense presence on their skin.  
  
Discordant sounds unheard of in this world resounded, and a dark veil
covered the sky.  
By the time the foreboding that began last night became a certainty,
exorcists all over the world had gathered at the Far East Seventh
Branch.  
To protect the star from the great evil, they had set up camp on the
summit of Zaobi Mountain.  
  
"—Die for the star. I must tell you this. What is about to befall this
star is more powerful and terrifying than anything we have ever
encountered. ...We don't know the cause or reason. But without even
considering its purpose, its threat is something everyone feels."  
  
Standing on a rock, giving a speech, was Golkista Veze, the head of the
Exorcist Association. A little over one hundred and seventy
centimeters—not very tall, but with a well-trained body and sharp eyes.
The magical power enveloping his whole body was sharpened to a piercing
point.  
  
Before him were over three hundred exorcists and spirits.  
And the great demons who offered a truce and cooperation in the face of
the star's crisis. Everyone stared intently at Golkista.  
  
"Compared to an elephant and an ant, no, even such an analogy seems
meaningless. There's no doubt that our world is now in twilight. Once
that being unleashes its fury, everything on this star will be trapped
in the abyss of the universe—eternal darkness. This may be nothing more
than a desperate struggle, a meaningless act."  
  
Golkista clenched his fist and looked around at everyone.  
  
"Still, I can only express my gratitude to those of you who have
gathered here, gambling on a glimmer of hope. Not only exorcists, but
also the spirits who have watched over humanity for a long time—and the
demons who have clashed with each other. For now, let us transcend the
boundaries of our races and unite as one, and for the sake of this star,
I ask for your cooperation."  
  
Golkista bowed deeply.  
Seeing this, one exorcist, Ledo, stepped forward, turned to everyone,
and raised his fist.  
  
"—For this star!!"  
  
At that signal, the exorcists raised their fists, and some of the
spirits responded as well.  
Many spirits and demons watched with cynicism or apathy, but at least
none of them tried to leave. Even those with conflicting interests, they
knew they couldn't overcome this crisis without unity.  
That is why they had gathered here.  
  
Among the spirits and demons were those who had lived for hundreds or
thousands of years, beings who had left their names in history, but it
was precisely because of this that they realized how precarious the
situation was.  
The being that was about to appear from the far depths was something
beyond their imagination.  
For example, it's like the author of a story and the characters.  
They felt the difference in dimensions on their skin.  
  
"Can we join in too?"  
"...Magical Kalua"  
  
Shelna, an exorcist standing beside Golkista, frowned and looked at
her.  
Cat ears and a tail, a purple gothic lolita dress.  
An incongruous, playful outfit that lookd like something out of a
children's morning show.  
Magical Mia beside her also looked nervously at the assembled crowd, and
behind them were a dozen more so-called magical girls.  
  
"Thank you, Magical Kalua. Your cooperation is reassuring."  
"I've gathered everyone I could contact..."  
"...Still, where is Magical Bery?"  
  
Kalua shook her head apologetically at Golkista's question.  
  
"I heard they were leaving this world for two or three weeks...If this
happened at this time, maybe they were working to prevent this."  
"...I see. But they failed..."  
"I don't want to think about it, but maybe..."  
"...Father. Do you know anything about Magical Bery?"  
  
When Shelna asked, Golkista groaned.  
  
Magical Bery and her group, the magical girls, who aimed for world
conquest and were enemies of the exorcists. However, Shelna and the
others always questioned their inexplicable actions, since they
sometimes fought alongside them as righteous heroes.  
There must be another reason for their actions—at least, for Ledo,
Shelna, Feni, and Toba gathered at the Far East Seventh Branch, that's a
shared opinion. There must be a reason.  
Golkista spoke, seemingly resigned, in response to Shelna’s gaze.  
  
"I don't know everything...But at least, I've heard that they are
working to prevent a great disaster that could lead to the destruction
of the world. The disturbances they've been causing in various places
were part of that...right? Magical Kalua?"  
"As far as I've heard, that's what they said...Mia, too, right?"  
"Y-yes..."  
"Honestly, I thought it was half a joke, but I never thought it would be
this serious..."  
  
Magical Kalua looked up at the sky and scratched her cheek. Lightning
flashed across the chaotic sky, mixed with dark colors, and the air
around them was freezing, even though it was summer.  
It's fortunate that ordinary people couldn't see it.  
It wouldn't be surprising if a global panic broke out.  
  
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it. We just have to do what we
can do. At least, we'll cooperate to the fullest this time. We don't
want to die, and maybe Magical Bery and the others are still working
somewhere to solve this, and if so, maybe we can make it."  
  
Golkista nodded at Magical Kalua's words.  
  
"Indeed...We still have some time. Let's believe in them and do what we
can. Shelna, let's devise a new strategy."  
"...Yes." 
<br /><br />

  
—Meanwhile, at Fairyland, the giant amusement park in the fairy
kingdom.  
  
"Magical Bery, I'd like a two-tiered chocolate cake."  
"Yes, Kreschenta-sama. Krische-sama, what about you?"  
"Um...Ehehe, Krische wants the same as Bery."  
"Aren't you eating too much already? I want to ride the roller
coaster."  
"Now, now...What will the Ojou-sama have?"  
"Strawberry and vanilla... Oh! There's a tentacle coming!"  
"Ojou-sama, no, that's not a tentacle, that's a Nyuron."  
"That's right, Selene. See? The tentacle is doing a nyuron."  
"I can't tell the difference..." 
<br /><br />

  
Two hours later—Shelna uttered in a daze.  
  
"...No way."  
  
The girl, who was touted as the greatest masterpiece in exorcism, was
about to collapse from the pressure.  
The space rift that appeared—from it emerged a tentacle so huge that it
was hard to even describe it as huge.  
It ripped open spacetime with brute force, and an eye peeked through the
gap.  
Even though it was at a height overlooking the clouds, it was so huge
that it seemed to cover half the night sky.  
If this being had a mass, just appearing would generate gravity,
stripping away the surface, whipping up seawater, and distorting the
planet itself.  
  
There, everyone present understood.  
What they saw there is not even the tip of the iceberg.  
Like peering through a hole in a shoji screen—what they saw was only a
small part. They looked like they were looking at the sun, or even a
celestial body far larger than that—the monster's size far exceeded
human comprehension.  
The pressure was enough to fully grasp their own insignificance.  
  
A being capable of turning a star, or even a star system or galaxy, into
nothingness.  
Compared to such a being, what was the resistance of such insignificant
beings?  
  
"...It's hopeless. I didn't expect things to end this way."  
  
The leader of the great power that controls the demons of the Far
East—the head of the Arna clan sat down on a nearby tree stump,
seemingly resigned.  
She swayed her seductive outfit that outlined her body, looked up at the
sky and smiled wryly. Even the spirits and great demons capable of
turning entire cities into scorched earth gave up—such a monstrous thing
they are facing. There were fewer people standing than those who had
already fallen. Exorcists one by one collapsed and some even urinated
from the primal fear that came from their very being.  
  
Even Golkista, who led them, could only stare blankly. No matter how
strong the opponent was, if they could deal a blow. That's what he
thought before.  
  
But the opponent was not someone they could deal with. Even if all of
humanity's strength and all its weapons were combined, it wouldn't even
cause a mosquito bite's worth of pain to this opponent. Through training
their minds and bodies, gaining experience and extraordinary power they
could understand some things.  
  
"...There's nothing left to do."  
  
To understand is to accept defeat. But that is a privilege only the
young have.  
  
"I don't want to just die. Rather than sitting here and waiting for
death, I want to struggle, even if it's meaningless. I want to die as
me, however pathetic it may seem."  
  
A pointless, reckless, and meaningless struggle. A rebellion. Resistance
against fate.  
That ignorance was also the courage to challenge the unknown.  
  
"We’ve gathered all this way just to watch our destruction? Wouldn’t it
be ridiculous to just do nothing? Let's at least try to fight back?
...Even if no one goes, I'll go alone."  
  
Ledo looked up at the sky and clenched his fist, and Shelna sighed upon
seeing this. She took his right hand.  
  
"You're such an idiot. ...An impossible idiot."  
"...Shelna"  
"I'm used to cleaning up after idiots. ...I'll stick with you until the
end."  
  
Ledo smiled happily as she laughed, and Feni took his left hand.  
  
"Are you trying to get a heroine point? I won't let you be the favorite,
Shelna. Feni, too, will go with Ledo-sama."  
"Feni..."  
"What's a heroine point?"  
"I won't lose to Shelna!"  
  
A man laughed while entwining his arms around her left arm.  
  
"Seriously, idiots remain idiots even in death... Oh well. I'll humor
this idiot just this once."  
"Indeed, he's been an idiot since birth. I won't let you have all the
glory."  
"Toba, Zuren…"  
  
The two of them bonked Ledo on the head as he thanked them.  
Golkista, watching this, smiled.  
  
"Recklessness is a young person's privilege… but it's quite dazzling. If
we're going to die anyway, let's struggle first… if this is the end, a
final bit of foolery isn't so bad, what do you all think?"  
  
Kalua, her gaze drawn, scratched her head and laughed, "Well, at this
point…"  
"I haven't given up… I don't think Magical Bery or Usa-chan are dead.
We'll just do what we can. Giving up is enough after we're dead… isn't
that right? Surprisingly, things work out by inertia sometimes."  
  
She looked at the spirits and demons.  
  
—And so, their crumbling resolve became one again.  
  
The ensuing battle was a magnificent spectacle that would be recorded in
the history of exorcism. Those who could fly took to the skies. From the
ground, a combined magical bombardment was unleashed.  
Aimed at what was presumably its weak point – its eyes – the barrage was
powerful enough to blow away mountains and distort spacetime—when it
hit, the abyssal monster flinched for a moment, its tentacles
trembling.  
As a form of protection against the attack, the abyssal monster deployed
a liquid-like barrier (looking like tear-filled moisture) over its eyes,
turning its gaze towards the exorcists gathered at the mountain.  
  
Only one tentacle extended from the sky to the ground. Seeing the other
tentacles move to protect its eyes, the exorcists felt a sense of
accomplishment and focused their magical power on preparing the next
barrage, while the aerial fighters created a diversion.  
Groups formed impromptu bombardment formations, firing repeatedly
through the gaps between the tentacles.  
  
As if the previous battles were mere child's play, the magical girls
flew about freely, unleashing incredibly powerful barrages.  
Alongside them at the forefront were the Kurenji Rana group, wielding
their magical beasts, lion-eagles.  
They were local exorcists with an uneasy relationship with the Exorcist
Association—they had once been enemies.  
But here, they were valuable allies.  
  
Some made contact with the giant tentacle, falling from their
griffins.  
Some were caught and nearly crushed by the massive tentacle, but they
were truly remarkable. Not a single one fell, all escaping capture and
returning to the battle.  
The abyssal monster's tentacles seemed slow-moving, but this was a
trap.  
Once the aerial fighters showed a significant opening, allowing their
bodies to be exposed in the air, the tentacles would grab them with
astonishing speed.  
  
It felt like this monster could wipe out the surface in an instant.  
The question of why it wasn't doing so arose, but there was no answer.  
Perhaps a significant amount of energy was being channeled into the
single tentacle extending towards the surface.  
  
The single tentacle descending from high above seemed to be aimed at the
Kyokutou Seventh Branch. It was built on an ancient sacred ground, a
place where ley lines converged.  
The purpose seemed to be to absorb the energy of the stars through these
lines.  
  
Shelna, the leader of the separate task force, positioned herself above
the Christand family's house, in the center of the ley line.  
She joined forces with Ledo and the others to deploy a large barrier
using the ley line.  
  
"Beasts are sensitive… Those children have noticed too."  
"Dogs?"  
"Yes, the Nyururun. Are they cheering us on?"  
  
For a moment, Shelna glanced downward.  
Dozens of purple dogs were gathered in the Christand family's garden and
on the roof.  
  
Raising its tentacles to the sky, it wiggled its whole body, Nyuruun,
Nyoroon, swaying like it was performing a mysterious ritual—Shelna
rubbed her eyes.  
Looking at the Christand family again, she saw the purple dogs.  
She shook her head, "Those are dogs," dismissing it as a
hallucination.  
  
"Are you tired?"  
"…"  
"…No, it's nothing."  
"Weren't the Bery group on a trip?"  
  
"A sightseeing trip. Selene and Krische have summer vacation too… I'm a
little envious."  
  
She reflected on her short student life, remembering the time she spent
with her diligent juniors, Selene and Krische.  
Her first and last student life was fruitful, and she even joined the
student council—it had been a fun time.  
They remained friends, having barbecues together once a season.  
She learned to cook from Bery, and they talked about dramas—she never
imagined how enjoyable her life here would be.  
  
She didn't think they could win.  
It was just a desperate struggle, nothing more.  
But because of that, she hoped that the end of those who had given her
so much would be happy.  
  
"But… it's good I wasn't here."  
"Yeah…"  
"Shelna-san, please don't get all lovey-dovey with Ledo-sama… It's
coming."  
"I know…!"  
  
The distance was now several hundred meters.  
They probably had less than a minute to live.  
Still, to gain something, Shelna accelerated her thinking, pouring all
her innate talent and accumulated experience into a final effort.  
She absorbed stellar energy from the ley line, and together with Ledo
and the others, she deployed a multi-dimensional barrier using it—a
barrier to simply withstand the descending tentacle.  
  
"This…"  
  
However, even that was a trivial resistance against the monster.  
Like poking a hole in thin paper with a finger, the tentacle easily
pierced the dimensional barrier and approached.  
  
"…"  
  
It took less than thirty seconds to break eighty-three barriers. And she
watched as even the last barrier, created with everything she had, was
casually torn apart.  
  
"Shelna…!"  
  
They had combined their strength, exerted their full power, but all it
amounted to was a foolish and reckless struggle.  
Shelna, watching the barrier she had created with all her might break,
lost her ability to fly and fell.  
  
"…Eh?"  
  
Suddenly, her body was caught.  
In her wavering vision, she saw red hair and a frilly, pink gothic
lolita dress.  
  
"I apologize for being late. …Everything's alright now."  
  
A magical girl with a troubled smile.  
  
"Kreschenta-sama, even at a time like this…"  
"I'm glad I left a cameraman behind for such an occasion. I'm looking
forward to it… I think I got some amazing footage. …Magical Bery, please
give Shelna a smile, I'll take a picture myself."  
"Um, well…"  
"I'll use it for the movie advertisement. Quickly."  
"Haa…"  
  
Then, with the sound of the camera shutter and the dazzling light, she
lost consciousness. 
<br /><br />

  
The end of the world—in this desperate situation, the Magical Bery group
arrived.  
Later, she heard that Magical Krische, with her divine wings, drove back
the horror into space. What happened behind the scenes? What was that
monster?  
Her father, Golkista, seemed to have heard something from the Magical
Bery group, but ultimately, Shelna and the others received no
explanation.  
  
"…Thank you, for everything…"  
"No, we're all in this together…"  
  
Everyone at the Kyokutou Seventh Branch was incapacitated from
overexertion. Selene's father had caught a summer cold, and the Bery
group, who had apparently returned early from their trip, had been
visiting Shelna and the others every day, preparing meals and so on.  
She sipped ginger tea in her bed, watching Bery expertly peel an
apple.  
A pink bird was perched on her shoulder.  
She gave the bird a small piece of apple, arranging the cut apple slices
on a plate for Shelna.  
  
Shelna thanked her, took a bite of the apple and sighed.  
  
"What's wrong?"  
"No… I realized my own incompetence. I feel self-loathing. Ledo's
situation… ah, no, I caught a cold when Ledo was ill."  
"I-it's unavoidable. It's not Shelna-sama's fault."  
  
Shelna shook her head slightly at Bery's words.  
She truly couldn't do anything.  
She couldn't even strike a blow, she was completely paralyzed with
fear.  
If the Magical Bery group hadn't appeared, the world would have been
destroyed, and Ledo and everyone she should have protected would have
died.  
It was enough to make her realize her own weakness.  
  
"But…"  
"It's alright. When your body is weak, your spirit weakens too… Eat
plenty and sleep well, and you'll be back to normal."  
  
Bery smiled and stroked her head.  
Shelna blushed, but her eyes softened as she accepted the touch.  
It was an incredibly gentle feeling.  
  
She tilted her head, hearing the click of a camera shutter from
somewhere.  
The bird—Kreschenta—was flying beside Shelna and Bery.  
  
"…Kreschenta-sama, no."  
  
The bird was immediately grabbed by Bery, making a dissatisfied "Pee!"
sound.  
Bery smiled wryly, "Don't mind it," and stroking Shelna's head again.
She stood up and pulled up the covers.  
The soft smile up close overlapped with the hazy memory of Magical
Bery's smile.  
  
"I'll come again tonight. I'll bring something easy to eat, like
stew."  
"Yes… Thank you."  
  
She thanked her again, the bird clutched to her chest.  
When she turned to leave and reached for the door, Shelna unexpectedly
spoke.  
  
"…Magical Bery."  
  
She stopped for a moment.  
After a slight pause, she turned and asked.  
  
"Did you say something?"  
"No… I was saved by someone like you in a dream. …I wanted to thank you,
including that."  
  
Shelna shook her head quietly at her troubled smile.  
  
"…I'd like to have a barbecue again."  
"Fufu, yes. Let's make plans once your cold is better."  
  
"Yes. I'll prepare lots of delicious meat."  
  
Watching her nod and leave, she looked at the rabbit-like apple.  
Maybe, just maybe.  
Dismissing her thoughts,  
  
"…I hope we can continue to get along."  
  
The apple she bit into made a crisp, pleasant sound. 
<br /><br />

  
—And so, the Twilight Incident came to an end.  
  
"Very sorry. Yes, they didn't have any intention of destroying the
stars, it was a bit of a misunderstanding… like a greeting among humans.
Yes, their eyes were a little sore, but they're fine… Yes. We'll be sure
to contact you beforehand from now on—"  
  
"You idiots! Are you going to summon those troublesome creatures every
time someone gets a cold? What are you going to do if someone dies of
shock?!"  
"S-Selene, look, the Nyururun seem to be reflecting…"  
  
"You spoil them, that's why they don't understand! You can't give them
treats until they've reflected! Do you understand? No treats for at
least a month as punishment!"  
"Selene, that's cruel—"  
"That's still too lenient!"  
  
Encounter with the Great Demon from the abyss of space.  
  
"How about 'A Threat Beyond Time and Space' for the movie's subtitle?
From now on, we'll incorporate more cosmic horror elements, and
structure the story with three groups: Exorcists, Magical Girls, and
Cosmic Tentacles. It’s perfect, and we can make the reason the Magical
Girls are against the Exorcists to prevent the invasion of the Cosmic
Tentacles."  
"As expected of Her Majesty… With the increased scale, that's ideal.
Separately, for editing purposes, I'd like to shoot scenes showing the
Magical Bery group secretly working behind the scenes to prevent the
Cosmic Tentacle invasion."  
"I'll tell the Magical Bery group. Begil, you're in charge of that. Make
sure the tentacles look good. We need to negotiate with the Cosmic
Tentacle for their appearance…"  
"Yes. But is that really alright?"  
"It's fine. They seem to have a lot of free time. They said they want to
do some sightseeing leisurely next time, so if we just talk to them a
bit—"  
  
It threatened the peace of the stars, leaving many scars.  
  
"Hey, that's my meat, Ledo."  
"Idiot, first come, first served."  
"Nii-sama and Ledo-sama are like children…"  
  
"…Really, you idiot, Ledo. I'm sorry, Bery-san."  
"Fufu, it's alright. You brought a lot, and we still have plenty left…
Krische-sama, for the Nyururun too."  
"Yes!"  
  
A happy everyday life and an extraordinary life full of conflict.  
  
"Wait… Magical Bery, do we really have to fight? I don't think you truly
want this. There must be some reason."  
"Th-that's…"  
"Please tell me the reason. Then I can cooperate. I don't want to fight
you—"  
"That's enough chatter!"  
"K-Kreschenta…"  
"Magical Bery, you understand, right?"  
"Yes, Kreschenta-sama. Exorcist Shelna, I apologize… but the fate of the
world is at stake. As long as you obstruct our goal, we have no choice
but to fight. …Nyururun!"  
"…"  
  
Light and darkness.  
  
"…I'm sure Magical Bery doesn't want to fight us either."  
"Shelna…"  
"The cause is probably that horrible monster from the Twilight Incident.
It even appeared in our dreams… I think that's the root of everything… I
want to help that person."  
"I agree. I want to do something to help."  
"Yes. Even if we can't now, someday… Ledo, will you come with me?"  
"Of course. Anywhere—"  
"Shelna-sama, trying to get more heroine points… Feni will come too."  
"Feni, read the air."  
  
Peace was still a long ways away.  
  
"Um… I feel bad for Shelna-sama and the others, to be honest, it hurts
my chest. We're deceiving them, and it feels like I'm seeing my old
self…"  
"That's not allowed. If you don't care about the world, you can do as
you please."  
"If this charade is protecting the world, it's better if it were
destroyed… how many more years are we going to do this Magical Girl
show?"  
"Until we restore peace to the world."  
"The pest disturbing the world's peace is you."  
  
The battle of Shelna, the exorcist who protects the world, will
continue— 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
To be continued… (It won't be).
