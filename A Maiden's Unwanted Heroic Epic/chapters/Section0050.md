## Chapter 360: Far, Far in the Future III

The Albeneria Arsenal, where numerous magic weapons were produced, was
located in the western part of the royal capital.  
A vast complex, crisscrossed by a railway network, bustled with workers
and mages moving about.  
There were numerous colossal warehouses, and inside one, where three
thousand Jarea-Gashea units—weapons that would dominate the world for
the next millennium—were neatly arrayed, a man and a girl stood.  
  
"Nigel, you were here?"  
"Krische-sama..."  
  
The Jarea-Gashea units slept like the dead.  
The factory chief, a man with a prosthetic arm named Nigel, who had been
gazing at the core storage area within, turned and immediately
saluted.  
  
"I hear all units have been serviced. Thank you for your hard work."  
"...Not at all."  
  
The silver-haired girl smiled and said, touching a random core and
channeling magic into it.  
The cores in the vicinity glowed in resonance, and she nodded.  
  
"In the Elsren battle, a total of 27,543 people... Ehehe, with the
learning function and sharing, they're not so foolish anymore, and their
performance feels pretty good too."  
  
With just a touch, the girl meticulously examined the vast records
within.  
Nigel lowered his eyes at the number.  
The learning function had been implemented after the failed trial
operation during the Great Five Nations War.  
  
*'Even Krische isn't perfect, so there are still omissions. If the
Jaragasha themselves scrutinize combat records and learn each time,
Krische thinks those silly mistakes will decrease.'*  
  
After that, the performance of the Jarea-Gashea dramatically improved.  
For learning trials, the army set up several units in training grounds,
where soldiers eagerly trained against them.  
Initially overwhelmed by the coordinated elite soldiers, the
Jarea-Gashea gradually learned from them.  
They learned to break through encirclements and defeat enemies
individually.  
The mechanical dolls, which had once wielded only pure violence, learned
tactics and acquired skills by fighting against renowned warriors of the
army.  
Improved by the hand of the girl—Alberinea—they gained more precise
perceptual abilities and achieved astonishing results in the mop-up
operations during the war with Vezlea.  
  
"The age of warriors is over, huh?"  
So spoke Kokys Agrand, said to be the kingdom's greatest spearman after
Alberinea.  
  
"I don't feel I'd lose in a one-on-one, but if ten or twenty of them
come at me, my weapon won't hold up. And it's only now that I won't
lose; in my younger days, I'd have been easily minced. It's a pity to
think that the young ones of the future will have to fight things like
these."  
"Commander Agrand..."  
"For us, war is just another part of everyday life. Though it's a matter
of life and death, when we clash with our honed skills, we come to
understand each other's beliefs, ways of life, inner hearts, and souls,
more than just talking. It's rough, but it's a form of dialogue. Between
humans."  
  
His eyes were a little sad.  
  
"But these things have none of that. They don't converse; they just
impassively cut down the enemy in front of them. ...In the future,
warriors like us, who live on the battlefield, will never flourish."  
  
—A pacifist mechanical doll, just like our war-hating Krische-sama.  
  
The great warrior's words, a mix of exasperation and regret, still
echoed in his ears.  
  
The Jarea-Gashea slaughtered the soldiers who barricaded themselves in
the fort, crying for total resistance to protect their homeland.  
It was a gruesome sight that made Nigel, who commanded them, shudder.  
No matter how many times he repeated in his heart that this was war, to
protect his comrades' lives, a leaden weight settled inside his chest.  
  
In the war with Elsren, such scenes must have been common.  
Nigel himself had wielded a sword in the civil war and killed many, but
there was a mutual understanding.  
They both had things they couldn't yield, and he too was fighting,
putting his single life on the line.  
He now thought how easy and fortunate it was to have such an excuse.  
  
With just a slight glow from a magic crystal with a silly name, this
iron doll mercilessly cut down enemies.  
The heat of the battlefield, where he had rushed with his comrades, was
now a distant past.  
The more results they achieved, the more his body trembled, feeling cold
and nauseous.  
  
—Krische-sama created these weapons for their sake.  
Nigel understood that, and he knew her kindness and purity.  
He revered her as his lord, whom he loved more than anyone and to whom
he would dedicate his life.  
That's why he couldn't hate anyone.  
  
Nigel picked up one of the cores.  
Manufacturing number: Unit 3—the Jarea-Gashea he used.  
  
"What will happen to these, after everything is over?"  
"…?"  
"For example, in the future... if a time comes when this power is no
longer needed."  
"I don't think there's anything that can be done..."  
  
The girl, with the endearing gesture of tilting her head, pondered.  
  
"Ah but, you're right. It would be a waste if they were just discarded
after being created, or left to sleep in a warehouse. It would be good
if they could do some other work besides fighting on the battlefield."  
  
At her subsequent words, Nigel nodded happily.  
Possessing a superior mind, yet sometimes failing to notice obvious
things or speaking off-topic, his lord was a little childish and
eccentric.  
Yet, when he asked her, she would genuinely consider his words, even
those of a man like Nigel, and return a gentle answer characteristic of
her.  
  
The Jarea-Gashea was a terrifying weapon.  
An iron monster created by her ruthless innocence.  
It was so unreasonably absurd it made him nauseous, and just looking at
it sent shivers down his spine.  
Yet, Nigel felt as fond of it as he did of his prosthetic arm.  
A pacifist mechanical doll—an invention created by his lord, who loved
peace more than anyone and cherished those around her.  
  
He didn't know how many times he had thought of crushing it with his own
hands.  
However, Nigel couldn't bring himself to hate this weapon as truly
evil.  
As he listened to the numbers of the dead she had casually spoken of
earlier,  
  
*'See, many Kuro also died in the last battle, and Nigel's arms and legs
were blown off. But with these manufactured soldiers, even if limbs are
blown off, they can be repaired, and even if they break, they can be
remade... So wont you feel safer with these?'*  
  
He could never forget her smiling face as she said that.  
He probably never would for the rest of his life.  
What filled this core was the undeniable affection of his revered
lord.  
  
"Let's review and expand the existing housekeeping functions for
carrying cargo and such. That's what you mean, isn't it, Nigel?"  
"Yes, Krische-sama. That's exactly what I meant."  
  
Nigel gazed gently at the core in his hand.  
  
"I hope that one day, when they awaken in a peaceful world, these
Jarea-Gashea, which Krische-sama gave us, will work for people and be
loved. ...It would be sad if what Krische-sama created for peace were
not needed in a peaceful world."  
  
He hoped that the affection stored within this core would one day reach
someone.  
That they were not ruthless, cold-blooded killing dolls, but rather
meant to bring happiness to people.  
He hoped that even a little of his beloved lord's feelings would be
conveyed.  
  
Suddenly noticing a glaring gaze, Nigel hastily spoke.  
  
"My apologies, it's Jaragasha."  
"...Really. You still can't get rid of that accent. Krische'll have to
teach the Jaragasha to be careful with incorrect pronunciations too."  
  
Nigel smiled wryly at his lord, who nodded seriously with her arms
crossed.  
  
"Well, it's fine. As Krische said, this was meant to be the final
adjustment, and once it's done, we can rest a bit and focus on
Gatan-goto. As for maintaining the exterior, Krische'll leave that to
the mages from now on."  
"...Yes. Thank you, Krische-sama."  
"Krische will also think about various housekeeping functions. Take a
good rest."  
  
Saying that, she raised a finger with a serious expression and trotted
away. Nigel smiled as he watched her retreating back.  
Always busy, always in a hurry wherever she went, always seeming eager
to finish tedious work and return to the mansion as quickly as
possible.  
  
She was created by such a beloved girl.  
He could not bring himself to hate her.  
  
"...That's what she said. Good for you."  
  
He mumbled, looking at the core, and then placed it on a shelf in the
storage area as if it were a jewel.  
  
"May you awaken one day in a peaceful world."  
  
In a place where even what kind of weapon you were would be forgotten.  
  
—In the far, far future. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
Currently, Sena's existence was legally clean.  
The current law wasn't that bad.  
Even if an illegally created artificial intelligence existed, the
developer was to be judged, and the created being was granted basic
human rights and respected.  
There was a criterion that limited this to those who possessed a certain
level of intelligence and biological thought, but even old working
robots with AI met that.  
Sena had no problems whatsoever.  
  
In the first place, she was an AI from an era when current laws didn't
exist—she was completely clean in that she didn't violate the law. There
was no reason to judge her, except for the fact that Dogle had conducted
AI research.  
However, even if she was clean, it didn't mean there were no problems.  
  
There were many ideologies and religions in the world.  
They spoke of bioethics in various definitions.  
The pros and cons of putting machines into human bodies, genetic
therapy, modification, pharmacology, surgical treatment, artificial
intelligence, and robots—the issues raised were so numerous it was hard
to cover them all.  
Dogle had his own ideologies, and there was no problem with that
itself.  
He believed society should be one where discussions take place rather
than one where they don't, and that any assertion should be
recognized.  
And that the current society was formed through the tremendous effort of
considering each other's opinions, compromising where possible, and
finding common ground.  
  
But there were also those in the world who believed only their own ideas
were most correct, directed hostility towards differing opinions, and
tried to resolve matters through violent means.  
It was such people who had taken Dogle's wife and daughter.  
If he were to casually bring Sena out into the open, they would live in
fear of their violence, and there would be no way to stop it.  
  
Just as Dogle believed that discussion was important, he also thought it
was somewhat inevitable that some people would view violence as a valid
means of response.  
From Sena's era, and long before, humanity had ultimately resolved
matters through the diplomatic means of violence, and even the
intelligent Minalshi were still at war with hostile species with whom
they could not communicate.  
Children would punch each other when they argued, and some adults were
like that too.  
  
Humans weren't perfect, nor as rational as many thought.  
If they were, there would be no need for codified laws.  
  
Given that, the question was how to invite Sena into this society as a
human being.  
The sticking point was her background.  
  
Jarea-Gashea, the combat magic doll created by Alberinea.  
What was hidden within it was an advanced artificial intelligence that
couldn't be replicated even with modern technology—no matter how you
looked at it, it would attract attention.  
Scholars, celebrities, and the media would flock to this rural town.
That would be one thing, but for anti-AI extremists, she would be a
prime target.  
They would likely try to harm her, thinking it an opportune moment to
spread their views.  
  
However, he didn't want to use methods that would tarnish her record,
such as forging her family registry.  
After much discussion with Orus and others, they arrived at a somewhat
forceful solution.  
  
"It's been a long time, Sena."  
  
As he left the prison, Orus and Sena were there in a car to greet him.  
  
"...Professor."  
  
Sena's eyes widened at Dogle's appearance, and she stopped.  
Orus approached him with a beaming smile and hugged Dogle.  
  
"Truly, good work, Professor. ...Today, we're having a party at my place
to celebrate your release. Everyone's waiting for you."  
"Thank you, Orus-san. I apologize for worrying everyone."  
  
He smiled, stroking his head, where his buzz cut had grown out a
little.  
  
Another six months had passed since then, during which he had developed
an artificial intelligence using ether crystals, together with Sena.  
They created a story: Dogle, heartbroken and mentally unwell, had
created Sena, an artificial intelligence with a certain level of
cognitive ability, resembling a human.  
It was half-true, only Dogle himself lacked the technology to create an
AI.  
Orus, upon hearing this, agreed to play along for his friend's sake,
advising him to turn himself in.  
  
The illegal development of artificial intelligence carried a heavy
penalty.  
However, the tragedy of Dogle losing his wife and daughter had been
widely reported in news worldwide. Orus also held a grand press
conference for Dogle, explaining the circumstances again. As a result,
sympathy outweighed the backlash.  
Considering the circumstances, leniency was granted, and his sentence
was reduced to ten years.  
  
Orus must have had a harder time than Dogle.  
  
While the development of artificial intelligence was an unforgivable
act, the emotions behind it were understandable.  
By protecting Dogle, stating that even if he made a mistake, he was his
dear friend, the company received a lot of harassment.  
He had said they would eventually get bored, but when he visited during
that time, he had deep dark circles under his eyes and looked suddenly
aged. Yet, he never missed a visit, always smiling, and Dogle couldn't
thank him enough.  
  
Then, separating, Orus and Dogle wiped away the faint tears and
laughed.  
  
"Come, to the car..."  
"Yes. ...Is something wrong? Sena."  
  
Sena stood still, staring at Dogle.  
  
Sena had been staying with Orus's family.  
Dogle had told them not to bring her to visits, fearing what she might
say. Orus had apparently explained to others that he was keeping them
apart as a matter of principle, meaning to atone for the crime.  
It had been a long time since he had seen her outside of censored video
messages.  
  
Sena looked at Dogle with a surprised expression.  
And then, her gaze wavered as if in hesitation.  
Orus had said that she had become quite human-like during her time with
his family.  
She was apparently close with Orus's daughter, who taught her many
things, and she had become able to smile naturally.  
  
Dogle tensed, wondering if she was showing such a face after a
long-awaited reunion.  
  
"...Sena?"  
"I feel like I understand many things now. ...Though I can't quite put
it into words."  
  
Sena looked down, pressing her hand to her chest as if in confusion.  
Orus, too, looked at her in surprise at her words.  
  
Sena closed her eyes, then looked up, gazing at Dogle.  
  
"—How about 'Chestnut burr'?"  
  
More precisely, she looked at his hair, which had grown out a little
from his buzz cut.  
  
"That, well..."  
"Of course, it's the Professor's nickname."  
  
Dogle wondered what was "of course."  
But Sena smiled faintly, still pressing her hand to her chest.  
  
"Master noted that nicknames pop into existence suddenly... I see, this
is what she meant. Now... I truly felt something pop into my mind."  
"Th-That's good, Sena."  
"Yes. I've always wanted to return the favor for the nickname you gave
me, Professor, and finally, I can."  
  
Everything was for her.  
However, he hadn't expected much from a reunion after ten years, nor had
he particularly hoped for it.  
It was just something Dogle wanted to do.  
But as he looked at her again, an indescribable feeling, *'Ah, this is
the kind of child she was,'* filled his entire being.  
  
"Chestnut Burr... Chestnut Burr, it really is a very good nickname."  
  
He chuckled, "Well, if you say so," and exchanged glances with Orus, as
she nodded repeatedly, savoring her joy. 
<br /><br />

  
Orus's mansion was right next to the Loctana headquarters.  
Orus's wife and daughter met them as they returned by car, smiling.  
  
"Mili, you've grown so much."  
"Hehe, it's been ten years, after all... Welcome back, Professor."  
"Ah, I'm back. I heard that you've taken good care of Sena. ...Thank
you."  
  
Her hair was golden, like her mother's.  
She released the embrace, shook her head, and smiled sweetly.  
  
"Sena-san was only eight when she came to us, so if anything, I owe her
a lot..."  
  
Mili gave a wry smile.  
  
"She taught me, played with me... I should be the one thanking her. Of
course, she made me cry plenty too."  
  
Then, she looked at Sena with amusement and said.  
Since Sena would be staying at Orus's house for a while until Dogle was
released from prison, she eagerly helped out around the Orus household
as a housekeeper.  
She was reportedly very proactive, even with Mili's care, but Sena was
inflexible.  
  
*"Mili-sama, it is currently time for backward roll practice. Shedding
tears does not contribute to improvement; in fact, I judge it to be a
waste of time. I would prefer you resume practice quickly."*  
*"Uuu...!"*  
  
If Mili wanted to learn backward rolls, Sena would dispassionately
say:  
  
*"Mili-sama, before learning equations, I believe you should review
addition once more. I cannot imagine what kind of calculation is being
performed in Mili-sama's mind to yield the number 20 when adding 12 and
7."*  
*"You don't have to say that much just because I made a little
mistake...!"*  
*"Mili-sama's answer implies a bizarre phenomenon where one additional
Lacra fruit of unknown origin suddenly appears in the basket when 12 and
7 Lacra fruits are gathered. I believe this exceeds the scope of 'a
little mistake', but is my definition incorrect?"*  
*"Uu, shut up...!"*  
  
In studies, not even minor mistakes were tolerated.  
  
*"Mili-sama, you have grown. Your survival time has improved compared to
before."*  
*"Um, I know Sena is strong, but...? Is there no consideration for a
beginner like me, like going easy on me...? I'm getting completely
dominated and can't do anything."*  
*"In terms of play time, Mili-sama should have played this game more...
Understood. I will restrict the in-game tactical level to 'very foolish'
to match Mili-sama's abilities, and endeavor to play with restraint in
the future."*  
*"Uh, you know everything, but you're not actually trying to provoke me
on purpose, are you...?"*  
*"...? Provoke?"*  
*"Uu, no, never mind..."*  
  
If they played games, Sena would unilaterally and thoroughly crush
her.  
In the beginning, Orus and his family seemed troubled by her crying
almost every day, but fortunately, Mili was a good child and didn't
dislike her, accepting her as a troublesome older sister.  
  
"But it's a little sad that today's goodbye."  
"It's just nearby. Feel free to visit anytime. Sena will be happy
too."  
"...I'll be happy?"  
"...Sena-san, at times like this, I wish you'd say you're happy, even if
it's a lie."  
  
Dogle bowed his head, apologizing to Mili, who spoke with
exasperation.  
Mili smiled wryly and shook her head.  
  
"It's alright. I know Sena-san is like this. I understand Sena-san
better than the Professor does now."  
"You've been with her for ten years. I can't argue with that."  
  
He chuckled, narrowing his eyes at the phrase *like this*.  
For her, Sena was not merely a machine but a person.  
Being thought of that way was what made him happiest.  
  
About thirty people had gathered for the party.  
Orus had intended it to be a small party to celebrate a friend, not a
company event, but most had apparently volunteered to attend.  
Most were researchers from the development department, with whom he had
long associations.  
Everyone sincerely rejoiced at Dogle's return.  
  
Most were unaware of Sena's origins and treated Dogle, who had
ostensibly committed the illegal act of AI development, with unchanged
demeanor.  
Many expressed that they were happiest to see him smile again, shedding
tears, and Dogle was also moved to tears.  
  
No one harbored ill feelings towards Sena either; Orus had involved her
in development department issues several times, so they were generally
positive.  
Her *personality* was also understood, and she was now accepted as *just
that kind of person*, just like Mili.  
  
One of the reasons unauthorized AI development was illegal was
humanitarian.  
Humans are not clean creatures.  
Some humans find joy in tormenting others, and some try to use others
for pleasure.  
Artificial intelligence would be a convenient tool as an outlet for such
human desires.  
There are countless individuals who would manipulate AI, thinking of
them as mere constructs, not human.  
To prevent such individuals from creating and possessing unfortunate
AIs, AI development was thoroughly managed. Only those adhering to
ethical guidelines were permitted.  
  
Even if it wasn't malicious, the same applied.  
For example, AI created as substitutes for a wife or daughter were also
unfortunate beings.  
Despite being different entities, their identities were twisted for
selfish reasons, and they were treated as substitutes for someone else,
which should never be condoned.  
Dogle, despite his emotional distress, thought the same way on that
point. While she filled the void in his heart left by the loss of his
wife and daughter, he never thought of naming her after them.  
  
Others seemed to have had concerns about this too, but Sena, though
similar in appearance to his wife and daughter, was a completely
separate being.  
She was serious, inflexible, and never smiled, unlike the bright
personalities of the other two—they understood that she was an entity
created with her AI personality fully acknowledged, and they were
greatly relieved.  
They accepted her as Dogle's other daughter and interacted with her
accordingly.  
  
Kind and gentle people.  
The people here were also Dogle's cherished family.  
He felt ashamed to think that his mentally ill self had forgotten such
things.  
Not just Orus, but many others had deeply worried about Dogle.  
  
When he conveyed his feelings to Orus,  
  
"I figured you'd say that, Professor. Of course, there are significant
risks, but like you, I want to believe in human goodwill. ...Sena's
future will require a lot of goodwill."  
  
He called those who had gathered, asking only those who could keep a
secret to their grave to come to the reception room, and decided to tell
them about Sena's origins.  
The crystallization of Alberinea's wisdom, created 14,000 years ago—  
  
"—13,562 years ago, Professor Chestnut Burr."  
"...My apologies."  
  
Although the conversation was frequently interrupted by corrections,
perhaps that was for the best.  
  
It seemed that it was not just a few people who had questioned whether
someone as exceptionally intelligent as her could have been created by
an individual like Dogle.  
However, Dogle's wild explanation that she was a product of Alberinea's
lost technology, though still hard to accept, apparently satisfied them,
thanks to her reactions.  
  
There was no one involved in etheric prosthetics who didn't know
Alberinea's name, and there were also staunch believers in the Alberinea
myth, which Dogle had once dismissed.  
And—  
  
"Sena, the Jarea—"  
"Jaragasha, Mili-sama."  
"Ugh, I wish you wouldn't interrupt my expressions of surprise...
Anyway, I guess I finally understand why I was taught such strange
pronunciations during history lessons... Papa, you could have told me
too."  
  
Mili glared at Orus, sighed deeply, and then looked at Sena, saying,  
  
"Hey, Sena-san. I have a favor to ask you."  
"...A favor?"  
"Yes, um—"  
  
How things intertwine and what future they lead to.  
One cannot know what lies ahead, including both good and bad.  
A single encounter, a single word can change something profoundly.  
  
The exchange that day was probably one such instance.  
Dogle and those who listened laughed in exasperation, wondering if the
young girl's outrageous request meant she hadn't heard the previous
conversation.  
  
But no one knows what the future holds.  
Perhaps, if the threads are intertwined with love and goodwill, they
will lead to a good future.  
  
Probably, that's how this child drifted into this era.
