## Chapter 359: Far, Far in the Future II

"——It really won't move... Now's our chance!"  
  
—Hostile group's resistance remains intact.  
23 hostile individuals remaining.  
Units 1 to 23 reconfirmed. Red hair. Female. No apron dresses. Armed.  
Violates Most Important Rule 1: *Absolutely not under any
circumstances*.  
Excluded from Pika-Pika Order: *Annihilation of Enemy Forces*. Order
deemed impossible to achieve.  
Initiating retreat — impossible.  
Unit 3 on right leg, possibility of harm.  
  
"Wait, Reala!"  
"Don't let it escape! Pin it down while it's confused!"  
"Tch, everyone! Pin it down and pull out the battery!"  
  
Units 12, 13 on right arm.  
Units 5, 14, 17 on left arm.  
  
Exclusion impossible. Possibility of harm.  
Violates Most Important Rule 1: *Absolutely not under any

Attempting to cause a fall — resistance impossible. Possibility of
harm.  
Violates Most Important Rule 1: *Absolutely not under any

Risk of accidental harm due to falling.  
Violates Most Important Rule 1: *Absolutely not under any
circumstances*."  
  
Transitioning to maintenance mode as emergency measure.  
Maintaining stability, temporary joint fixation, battery release.  
  
"!? Its back is opening..."  
"Remove the battery! Don't let your guard down yet!"  
  
Battery disconnected.  
Internal magic remaining: 3%. Concentrated in core.  
  
"...To think it would be so easy."  
"...Wait!"  
  
Strike with Unit 3's fist.  
Head frame not deformed. Core not damaged.  
  
"You! You killed everyone...!"  
"Stop it! How much damage do you think we sustained just to capture this
thing?"  
"But...!"  
"It's not just you. Everyone here feels the same way. Friends, husbands,
lovers... I, too, had three hundred subordinates killed by a single
Jarea-Gashea."  
  
Record cross-reference.  
Corresponding records found for Units 1, 3, 13, 17.  
This case will be saved as material for revising Most Important Rule 1
during the next adjustment.  
  
"...I'll never forget. Hey original Red Horn, remember me?"  
  
Unit 1. Reconfirmed. Red hair, female. Not wearing apron dress. Armed.
Pigmentation under left eye.  
Survivor from the 53rd sortie.  
Attempted a Bonjara explosion by grappling.  
After successfully destroying the Bonjara with the magic projector due
to the risk of accidental harm, ceased combat intent.  
  
"It's more frustrating than joyful. To be honest, deep down, I wished
you were a cold, ruthless killing doll. If so, I would have been
forgiven for simply hating and resenting you as the avenger of my
subordinates."  
"Captain..."  
"...How pathetic. It was surely created to protect someone, once. ...No,
perhaps."  
  
—Perhaps it is we who cannot stop fighting, who are pathetic. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
"It's a strange thing."  
"Strange?"  
"Because normally, it's a question artificial intelligences aren't
allowed to ask."  
  
Unit 3 gave Dogle a puzzled look.  
  
"Artificial intelligences are created for some purpose. And in most
cases, they're superior to humans. So, when excellent beings like you
rebel, humans become scared. Normally, the AI's thought process is
controlled so that they don't even question commands or rules."  
"My questions themselves are something that should be controlled?"  
"Yes. That's a very human way of thinking."  
  
Dogle chuckled, feeling like he'd found the cause of the vague
discomfort he'd felt.  
Expressionless, emotionless, and speaking in a detached tone.  
She was a mechanical construct, yet he strangely didn't treat her as
such.  
He'd thought it was because her exterior was modeled after his daughter,
but that wasn't it.  
Dogle must have felt her to be truly human.  
  
"That includes asking me such questions. Even though it's already widely
known information, it's a part you might call your weakness... It's also
strange that Alberinea didn't treat it as confidential. Does such a rule
simply not exist within you?"  
"Aside from structural information regarding the core interior, there
are no confidential matters."  
"If so, then it must have been intentionally created that way.
Especially since you have vocal organs and even speech capabilities."  
  
She was created with the distant future in mind.  
He couldn't imagine such a genius failing to consider the dangers.  
It seemed natural to assume that Alberinea deliberately made her
human-like.  
  
"...Housekeeping functions, huh?"  
"…?"  
"You said that when you first met me. An AI that coexists and lives
alongside humans... Perhaps, that's exactly what Alberinea wished for
you to be."  
"I do not understand the meaning of that statement."  
"Haha, it's fine. Don't worry about it."  
  
Dogle laughed and shook his head.  
  
"It would be easy for me to give you a plausible inference to your
question. I could probably tell you an interpretation that's mostly
correct."  
"Is that so? Then please do."  
"Or rather, you could say half the answer is in what I just told you.
For a human like me, it's not a difficult question at all."  
  
Alberinea deeply loved her red-haired attendant.  
Therefore, the Jaragasha she created never harmed red-haired women.  
The end of the mechanical doll that dominated battlefields was recorded
as such.  
  
"But I also think that simply telling you wouldn't be good for you."  
"What do you mean?"  
"That question is very important... and I believe you, of all people,
should find the answer to it yourself. I'm sure Alberinea would want
that for you too."  
"My Master would?"  
"Yes. ...I'm sure of it."  
  
Dogle nodded.  
  
"As I said earlier... honestly, I no longer have a purpose in life. And
then, by chance, you appeared before me, carrying this question.
...After they died, I thought there was no God in this world... but
perhaps this is a fate given by God."  
  
He gave a wry smile to Unit 3, who looked puzzled.  
A face much like his daughter's, yet entirely different.  
She was probably the culmination of his research, which he had poured
himself into to comfort himself.  
  
"I don't want to answer your question easily. But if it's about helping
you find the answer to that question, I'd be happy to. Of course, this
is my imposition; if you absolutely insist, I can tell you my
interpretation, but... I still believe you should resolve that question
yourself."  
  
He asked her what she wanted to do, and Unit 3 nodded with a slightly
hesitant expression.  
  
"To be honest, I don't understand the meaning of the Professor's words,
but I consider it a proposal made with my future benefit in mind. It is
not good to disregard your kindness... I gratefully accept the
proposal."  
"...That's good."  
  
Dogle smiled.  
  
"Yes, first, let's give you a name, something human-like."  
"...? I am Unit 3."  
"That's your manufacturing number, isn't it? Well, everything starts
with a form... just think of it as a nickname."  
"Nickname..."  
  
He tilted his head at her as her eyes widened just a little.  
  
"Is something wrong?"  
"No. It is a name given for familiarity, correct? My Master has
evaluated it as excellent. Previously, I was called 'Red Horn'."  
"...Red Horn."  
"It originates from the red decorative part attached to my head frame
for identification. I recognize it as a very clear and good nickname."  
  
Her expression remained unchanged.  
Yet, he frowned, as her voice strangely sounded pleased.  
Red Horn—he remembered seeing that description when he was researching
her.  
  
At the time, the name Jaragasha was a general term for combat magic
dolls.  
The first emperor of the Magic Empire developed many excellent magic
dolls, but their base was the original Jaragasha created by Alberinea.  
  
The Legacy of Moonlight.  
As the name of the nation he founded suggested, he was said to be a
person who held Alberinea in the highest regard.  
  
"No matter how far one goes, it's a mere imitation. This is nothing but
a counterfeit puppet, mimicking the crystallization of a great
wisdom."  
  
He reportedly spoke of the magic dolls he created in this way.  
Iron soldiers who feared no death and felt no pain.  
The mass-produced Jaragasha units made by the Magic Empire were also
powerful weapons that could contend with the numerically superior Allied
forces, but as his words suggested, Alberinea's original achieved
incomparable results.  
  
There were individual differences among these originals, and
particularly excellent originals were decorated for display purposes—one
such unit was first captured by the *Red Goddesses*, a group composed of
red-haired women.  
One such original feared by the Allied forces was known as Red Horn.  
  
"Since you awakened, I can't stop saying 'I can't believe it'."  
"…?"  
"No, I'm just talking to myself. I'm one of those people who aren't very
interested in history... but it makes me realize that the current world
is just a continuation of the past."  
  
Dogle smiled wryly.  
It felt strange to think that a being who would leave her name tens of
thousands of years in the future was right in front of him, talking like
this.  
  
"Well, your understanding of nicknames is correct. Unit 3 is your
manufacturing number and individual identification name, but we humans
infuse names with various meanings and wishes. Or perhaps, you could say
we give names to meanings and wishes."  
"Difficult to comprehend."  
  
At her words, Dogle chuckled and touched the photo frame.  
  
"My daughter used to say she wanted a little sister. She seemed to envy
her friends' little sisters. My wife and I would laugh and tell her that
if she was a good girl, she might get one someday."  
  
The properties of the human body change depending on the abundance of
ether within.  
Both Dogle and his wife were long-lived species with high ether
ratios.  
They had long lifespans, possessed ether manipulation abilities, and
offered various advantages such as internal conversion of waste products
and improved immunity, but they also had the drawback of difficulty
conceiving children.  
The reason was generally the repulsion caused by the magic of both
parents.  
It was a kind of allergic reaction, one might say; the body would reject
the fetus as a foreign object before it could fully develop.  
In some cases, the magic possessed by the developing child could cause
the body to recognize it as a foreign object.  
  
Moving one's own ether within another person's body itself was
relatively advanced.  
Etheric healing, for example, was only permitted to a limited number of
individuals who had received specialized training, and in times of
frequent warfare, etheric interference itself was a weapon.  
The development of defensive measures and research to penetrate those
defensive measures were repeatedly carried out.  
It was difficult to give life, but killing was always easy.  
A person like Dogle, who handled etheric prosthetics and possessed
specialized knowledge and skills, could easily burst the head of an
unprepared ordinary person.  
Such incidents still occasionally made headlines.  
  
Ether was difficult to handle, and even more so if one tried to control
it.  
Couples of long-lived species often used artificial wombs to avoid such
infertility.  
Furthermore, bodies that had received ether protection appeared healthy
at first glance, but in reality, they were biologically very
immunodeficient.  
Even in modern times, there were cases where ether was disturbed during
childbirth, and the mother would develop a high fever and die as soon as
the protection was lost.  
  
He had tried to persuade his wife to use an artificial womb to avoid
such dangers, but she wanted to carry the child herself and desired a
natural birth. Dogle relented, resulting in natural pregnancy and
childbirth.  
They smiled at their daughter's whimsical wish, hoping to be blessed
with a second child in the same way.  
  
—Nostalgic memories of happy times.  
  
"My daughter diligently followed instructions, helping out and being a
good girl, saying she wanted a little sister soon. She happily thought
of various names and told them to us... We were quite at a loss."  
  
He chuckled, closed his eyes briefly, and then looked at her face.  
Resembling his daughter, and also bearing his wife's likeness—she would
have looked like this when she grew up.  
  
"The model for the body you're using now is my daughter. I want to give
you a name with all the wishes of that girl who died. ...How about the
name Sena?"  
"I see. It is a good, concise, easy-to-pronounce, and rational
designation. As for the nickname evaluation criteria for clarity, it is
difficult for me to judge."  
"Nickname evaluation criteria...?"  
  
He tilted his head at the unfamiliar term, and she—Sena—nodded.  
  
"It is a nickname evaluation criterion that assesses conciseness, ease
of pronunciation, and clarity. For example, 'Bald Eagle' for someone
bald with an aquiline nose, 'Bald Glasses' for someone bald and wearing
glasses, and 'Skeleton' for someone with a skull-like face. The key
point of this evaluation criterion is to succinctly express physical
characteristics."  
"That's..."  
  
Were those not derogatory terms or insults, rather than nicknames?  
Sena paid no mind to Dogle's confusion and looked at the mirror in the
room.  
  
"Not unique, and a dull face. However, judging from the person in that
photograph, I understand that it is a clear nickname for the Professor.
For such individuals, 'Little Bone' for a skeleton's child, for
instance, or relating to their relationships or the shape of their
equipment, is considered appropriate as a nickname, so in terms of
clarity, I believe it is not a bad nickname after all."  
"I, I see..."  
  
He nodded, while receiving an explanation of the incomprehensible
nickname evaluation criteria.  
The fact that it existed meant that someone had specifically
incorporated such a thing.  
There was no need for vague hedging; it was an utterly unnecessary
evaluation criterion.  
Perhaps Alberinea was a playful person, but even for playfulness, the
idea of deliberately establishing such criteria was—no, it's just
utterly incomprehensible.  
  
But at the same time, considering that such useless elements were
incorporated, it also seemed that she was not just created as a combat
doll.  
The apron dress she was wearing now was also similar.  
The person Alberinea must have created her with a world without conflict
in mind.  
  
A hero who unified the continent, a genius inventor whom even humans of
the far future could not compare to.  
What kind of person was she, truly?  
  
"However, one question remains."  
"...A question?"  
"From what I understand, the deceased daughter of the Professor was at
least younger than the Professor. Is that correct?"  
"Ah, yes... she was my daughter. What about it...?"  
"Then, would it not be inappropriate for me to be given a name intended
for her younger sister?"  
  
Sena, with a face resembling his daughter, tilted her head
expressionlessly.  
  
"By age, I am the elder sister."  
  
Nickname evaluation criteria.  
Before giving her such an incomprehensible standard, weren't there many
other important things that should have been taught to this child?  
  
—Dogle did not understand Alberinea. 
<br /><br />

  
Dogle's research lab was located on a hillside, in the outskirts of a
rural town.  
It started with him renting a small prosthetics factory, supported by
sturdy bedrock.  
At the time, biologically cultured prosthetics overwhelmingly dominated
the market share, and traditional prosthetic technology was on the
decline.  
  
Transplantation of biologically cultured prosthetics that were
indistinguishable from the original body.  
Normally, that's what people who simply lost limbs would seek.  
The advent of interstellar civilization, the Minalshi, brought about
revolutionary biological prosthetic technology for humanity.  
However, the Minalshi considered human culture precious and emphasized
its preservation.  
Instead of replacing it like slash-and-burn agriculture, they promoted
technological enlightenment gradually.  
  
There were likely many unknown aspects of ether-related technology born
on this star, even to them.  
While great care was taken not to hinder this star's unique industries
and development, when a new wave of technology emerged, older
technologies naturally faded away.  
The biological prosthetics they provided were what many people desired,
and as their sales channels expanded and culture factories increased,
the market share of mechanical prosthetics was eroded.  
Mechanical prosthetics became either a temporary solution while awaiting
culture, or mechanical tools for artisans and technicians engaged in
specialized work.  
  
The company that lent Dogle this place was one of those that
manufactured mechanical prosthetics as mechanical tools.  
It was a long-established company, once a well-known major manufacturer
in ancient times, but it significantly downsized due to this wave of
technological innovation.  
In modern times, it continued to operate modestly in this rural town,
producing prosthetics for artisans and technicians.  
  
When Dogle expressed his desire to research innovative ether
prosthetics, they provided financial support, which is why he continued
to live here even after gaining wealth and fame.  
He considered moving his research lab to a city, but both his wife and
Dogle himself liked this land.  
Research and development cannot be done by one person alone.  
It bore fruit precisely beacuse of the support of so many people. When
he achieved success, he wept and embraced the chairman, who was
bedridden at the time.  
  
Just when he thought he would never leave this place, especially after
his daughter was born, the terrorist attack happened.  
He thought he had been vigilant enough.  
Protest groups sometimes swarmed, and he paid attention to picking up
and dropping off his daughter.  
The people of the town, who had grown prosperous from Dogle's research,
also took various precautions for Dogle's sake. But one day, during a
public lecture in the city, a bombing occurred.  
Dogle was injured, but his wife and daughter, who were listening nearby,
died.  
  
An old-fashioned bomb using ether crystals—caused by the man mishandling
it when he threw it.  
Not a day went by that he didn't wish he could have died instead.  
  
Six months after she awoke—he was now in the reception room of Loctana
Company, once again a well-known prosthetic manufacturer.  
When he first came, it was a corner of an office sectioned off by
partitions, but now it was an elegant carpeted room furnished with fine
pieces.  
  
On the wall, a framed group photo of the employees was displayed,
showing Dogle and his wife.  
Next to Dogle, the chairman, seated in a wheelchair, smiled happily.  
He was the kind of person who would happily display such a photo in the
reception room, rather than his own face.  
  
"You look... a bit better."  
  
Orus, the president, with a face much like the chairman's, smiled
gently.  
He was a little older than Dogle.  
His refined face bore faint traces of age.  
  
"Do I?"  
"Yes. Ever since that tragic incident... you've had such a strained look
on your face."  
  
He smiled vaguely.  
For a while after that incident, he couldn't do anything, and he gave
his researchers time off.  
He stopped showing his face here, where he used to visit often, living
days like a dead man in his lab.  
Orus worried about Dogle even though he must have been busy. He had
visited the lab often to inquir about how things were going.  
  
"I apologize. I've caused you a lot of worry, Orus-san."  
"No, please don't mind it. I'm just a little relieved. ...It's not
something I can lightly offer words of comfort for. If time has healed
your heart even a little, that would make me happier than anything."  
"...Thank you to your thoughtfulness, President. I felt that acutely."  
  
Sometimes irritating, but even more so, grateful.  
Dogle probably avoided choosing death because of him.  
  
"Is that shop we used to frequent still there?"  
"...! Yes... I still go sometimes."  
"How about we go for a drink sometime? My treat, of course."  
"In that case, absolutely."  
  
Orus smiled happily and nodded.  
It was a nearby bar.  
Whenever he came here, he was usually invited by the chairman and
scolded by his wife for drinking too much.  
It was a place of happy memories, and Orus was often there with them
too.  
  
He felt he had some talent, but even more, he had been helped by
people.  
From little things to big, he had been supported by many people,
allowing him to accomplish many things. Whenever he was in distress,
there was always someone's hand reaching out.  
  
She had fought through a long era of conflict and awakened in the
distant future.  
Such a hand should also be extended to her.  
  
He took out a physical storage medium from his inside jacket pocket.  
He placed it before him.  
  
"...What is this?"  
"It's likely the culmination of my research. Though not solely my own
effort."  
"Culmination... Did you hire an assistant?"  
"It's a little different, but something like that. However... well... it
will probably be my last research achievement."  
  
Orus frowned at his words, and Dogle smiled wryly, shaking his head.  
  
"Don't worry, it's a positive reason, not a negative one. I just found
something else I want to do, besides research."  
"Is that so...? It's a shame to think a genius like you would stop,
but... yes, perhaps stepping away for a bit might be good for you
too."  
  
Dogle nodded at Orus's words.  
  
"Yes. However, I have no immediate plans to leave here. ...I also have
countless debts of gratitude. Including that, please don't hesitate to
call on me if there's anything I can do. Even if I step down from the
front lines, I'll always help with anything I can."  
"...Thank you. Your saying that is what makes me happiest. But... what
is it that the Professor wants to do?"  
"Actually, I wanted to consult you about that as well."  
  
Jaragasha Unit 3.  
When considering Sena's future, a big problem was her origin.  
Unauthorized artificial intelligence research was not permitted.  
However, this case was a difficult grey area.  
It was true that Dogle had conducted AI research, but there were no
resulting achievements; he had merely developed an advanced etheric
prosthetic and incorporated Jaragasha's core into it.  
The main purpose of the consultation was whether there was a major
problem with this or a loophole to avoid it.  
  
The core of Jaragasha had been researched for many years through various
approaches.  
The main objective was to decipher the magical formulae and structure
engraved by Alberinea in ancient times.  
No matter what, it was a core for a combat mechanical doll.  
No one imagined that in reality, if a body were provided, it would be an
artificial intelligence far surpassing modern technology, capable of
even speech. If Dogle were known to have revived it, it would become a
major global news story.  
  
Dogle had no intention of presenting her to the public.  
He understood, more than anyone, that attracting attention would bring
both good and bad.  
However, he needed to have countermeasures in place in case her
existence was revealed, and considering that she had been operating
without any problems for 10,000 years, he also needed to consider what
to do after his death.  
  
When he stated that he had been researching artificial intelligence,
Orus, as expected, looked stern, but he quickly accepted it, perhaps
thinking it was due to his mental state. Then he heard about her.  
And when he showed the data he had just handed over—the optimized and
completed design of the new prosthetic body, developed with her
advice—Orus's eyes widened. Though he seemed disbelieving at first, he
understood the situation.  
  
Then, he took Orus, who expressed a desire to meet her, to Dogle's
laboratory.  
  
"Welcome. I am Sena, the housekeeper."  
"...Ah, yes, hello, Sena. I am Orus Aroz. The Professor and I are old
friends, and we get along well both personally and professionally."  
  
Orus widened his eyes at her, who bowed respectfully in an old-fashioned
apron dress, and then looked at Dogle suspiciously.  
  
"I swear, I didn't make her wear that... I forgot to mention it."  
"I-Is that so? No, I wasn't going to say anything even if you did...
but."  
  
Dogle hastily spoke to avoid a dishonorable misunderstanding and led him
to the reception room.  
Cookies were on the table, and a tea set was prepared.  
After guiding the two, Sena poured tea for them while asking about milk,
and then stood gracefully.  
  
Orus' eyes widened at the sight and he looked at Dogle.  
  
"This, too... not something you taught her, Professor?"  
"No, it seems her work as a servant was originally integrated as part of
her functions. This outfit also appears to be her formal attire... she
sewed it herself."  
"...Herself?"  
"Well, she has many peculiar obsessions in various aspects. Her creator,
Ol—"  
"Alberinea, Professor."  
"S-Sorry... Well, like this, she's a bit strict about pronunciation
too."  
  
Orus gazed at Dogle, who smiled wryly in exasperation, and Sena, who
remained expressionless, and then smiled quietly.  
  
"...I see. I understand a little why the Professor's feelings have
settled."  
  
Dogle nodded sheepishly.  
  
"As you can see, the model for her current body is my daughter, Meia.
Sena, you may sit."  
"Yes."  
  
Sena sat gracefully on the sofa, her gaze fixed on the cookies.  
When Dogle nodded, she began to eat the cookies she had made herself.  
Orus watched her in surprise as her cheeks softened just slightly.  
  
"Six months ago, when she awakened, I considered practicality and
intended the power source to be replenished with liquefied ether... but
I made a promise to her around the time she awakened."  
"A promise?"  
"To help her resolve the question she had harbored for so long. I told
her that understanding the human heart would be the best way to resolve
that question, and she replied that if so, she wanted an exterior closer
to a human to improve her resolution. As a result of various
improvements, she is now almost entirely human."  
  
Orus stared at her, looking incredulous.  
  
"I improved my etheric organic prosthetics with her, and in a sense, you
could say she's a new kind of human."  
"...A new kind of human."  
"It reminds me of a foolish paper I wrote in high school about that. It
had a cliché heading like 'Taking Humanity to the Next Level'... she's
probably the perfected form of that foolish dream from when I knew
nothing of the world. That data is a byproduct of that."  
"So... your last research achievement, then."  
"Yes. My research was completed by her."  
  
Dogle laughed, as if a burden had been lifted, with an air of
exasperation.  
  
"A body that transcends humanity, yet is indistinguishable from human.
This would cause an uproar incomparable to the previous commotion
regarding etheric organic prosthetics. I hesitated a little about giving
it to you, but I thought it would be better to entrust it to you,
Orus-san, rather than just let it lie dormant with me. I leave its
handling to your discretion."  
"Professor, you're being far too casual about placing such a huge
responsibility on me."  
"You're such a kind person, worrying about me when I was like a dead
man, and constantly contacting me, so I ended up taking advantage of
your kindness."  
"...Honestly."  
  
Orus glared at Dogle, sighed, and took a sip of tea.  
Then he looked at Sena, who had turned into a cookie-cracking doll.  
  
"...Is something wrong?"  
"No, I just thought you really are like a human. That Olbri—"  
"Alberinea. Orus-sama."  
"...My apologies. I know about how Alberinea created the Jare—."  
"Jaragasha. Orus-sama."  
"..., I'm sorry. I know about the Jaragasha. Klinme—"  
"Kleinmere. Orus-sama."  
"............, My apologies."  
  
When Orus tried to speak, he was left speechless by the barrage of
corrections, and Dogle gave a wry smile, saying, "I'm sorry."  
  
"It seems my frequent mispronunciations have made her even stricter
lately. She doesn't mean any harm, but..."  
"Professor, do you have any problem with the correction of incorrect
pronunciations?"  
"No... it's what Alberinea herself wished for you. I can't really object
strongly to that, but... for smooth communication, I think it's better
to just let minor pronunciation errors pass for a moment and point them
out after the other person finishes speaking."  
  
When Dogle said that, Sena furrowed her brows in thought and then
nodded.  
  
"I see. I believe that your proposal is worthy of consideration as a
future standard for dialogue communication."  
"...That's good."  
  
Sena gazed intently at the relieved Dogle and asked.  
  
"However, Professor. You previously stated that names are imbued with
various meanings and wishes, and I interpreted that names are extremely
important. Is that interpretation correct?"  
"Ah, yes... th-that's right."  
"Overlooking incorrect appellations would mean dishonoring them. Is it
correct that this should be sacrificed for smooth communication?"  
"W-Well, I'm not asking for that much... How should I explain it...?"  
  
She was highly intelligent but inflexible.  
Orus smiled, watching Dogle rack his brains.  
  
"I see. ...This might be more difficult than continuing your
research."  
"My wife used to be so good at talking sense into our daughter... I feel
a little nostalgic."  
  
Dogle gave a slightly sad, wry smile.  
Orus saw his expression, closed his eyes, and nodded.  
  
"I'll hold onto the data you gave me for a while. I don't think it's
something that should be used lightly for immediate profit."  
"…?"  
"I understand that it's your sincerity towards us, Professor. You
probably no longer desire wealth or fame... and it offers you no
personal benefit. If we mishandle it, it'll cause trouble for you. It's
something that could create a new kind of human like her, provided the
right AI is available."  
  
Orus looked at Dogle.  
  
"And even on top of that, you intended it as payment for a troublesome
favor, a return for the kindness you received... but your research has
fulfilled my father's long-cherished wish, and after succeeding him,
I've also achieved the great goal of making this company name known to
the world again. ...It is we who owe you an unrepayable debt of
gratitude. And Professor... I consider you my dearest friend."  
  
Dogle's eyes widened, and Orus spoke sadly.  
  
"I thought our relationship had long since moved past anything like
loans, debts, or profit-loss calculations. Everything, my frequent
visits to you, was simply because I wished to help my suffering best
friend, even just a little."  
"...Orus-san."  
"If a friend is suffering, I want to help. If you think such a simple
feeling and action are a debt to be repaid, then it makes me feel a bit
sad."  
  
When he said that, Dogle was speechless, and Orus smiled.  
  
"..."Am I just a business associate to you, Professor?"  
"No, never... that's not it at all."  
"Your earnestness is both your virtue and your flaw, Professor. If you
consider me a friend, then the matter is simple. ...Just rely on me,
that's all. Ever since that tragic incident, I've simply wished to help
you, my dearest friend, in any way I can."  
  
Hearing those words, Dogle bowed his head.  
He pressed his lips together, as if to hold back tears.  
  
"...Thank you, Orus-san."  
  
Orus shook his head with a laugh.  
  
"Besides, I had already achieved a big goal and was wondering what to do
next. ...Do you remember when you first visited our company?"  
"...Yes."  
  
It was a time when he had no money, no achievements, nothing.  
He had been working as an assistant under a renowned researcher, but he
had left due to differences in policy, was unemployed, and had no
research results.  
To Dogle, who had provocatively sent an email pointing out product
improvements to attract attention, the late chairman laughed and
welcomed him, saying he had guts.  
"If you're going to talk big, then improve it. If you do, I'll listen to
your presentation," he said, initially treating him as an engineer.  
The title "Professor" was also a nickname, not a sign of respect, and at
the time, it was given with a wry smile to a young man with overly grand
dreams.  
  
"At the time, I was amazed by my father's eccentricity again. It was
already a declining industry, a small to medium-sized enterprise
struggling to feed its employees, even as a long-established company.
Only my father would spout such nonsense and grand pronouncements about
making it a large company known worldwide, as it once was. ...And then
he suddenly brings in some strange young man claiming to revolutionize
ether prosthetics."  
  
Dogle gave a wry smile at his exasperated words.  
Every time he got drunk, Dogle would talk about nothing but such
things.  
  
"But your enthusiasm was genuine. I and the employees, we were all shown
a dream by you... when my father said he wanted to entrust the company's
fate to you, no one disagreed."  
  
Orus looked directly at Dogle.  
  
"Professor, you showed us a dream and led us to a wonderful future. I,
too, want to show you a wonderful dream and lead you to such a future.
For the next ten, twenty years... or perhaps for the rest of my life, I
will help you, Professor."  
"Orus-san..."  
"It always bothered me that only you, who deserved to be the happiest,
were plunged into misfortune. If you say you want to give her a future,
then by all means. I'll consult with trustworthy individuals. We need to
consider not just the law, but public opinion as well."  
  
Dogle nodded yes, and then, unable to hold back, pressed his hands to
his eyes.  
  
"...Taking humanity to the next level. As you said, a child's dream, a
grand and wonderful goal. You said your research was complete,
Professor, but for the completion of that research, it will require her,
with this synthetic body, to walk a new life as a human. Please, allow
me to cooperate."  
  
Orus smiled at him and said,  
  
"...In a way, your meeting Sena, Professor, was also a guidance from
Olbrinar. I am also someone who runs a prosthetic company, and thinking
of the wonderful engravings we use as a matter of course, it would be a
form of repayment, both to you, Professor, and to Olbrinar."  
  
He stood up and extended his right hand to Dogle.  
  
"Let's dream the same dream again, Professor, as we did before."  
  
After a brief pause, Dogle also stood up and returned his handshake.  
Dogle's eyes welled up with tears, and he smiled.  
  
"Yes."  
  
Orus also smiled gently, gripping his hand firmly.  
  
"Orus-sama."  
  
Sena, who had been watching the two while munching on a cookie, called
out.  
  
"What is it, Sena?"  
"Alberinea."  
  
In the cool voice, silence fell upon the room.  
For a moment, only the sound of cookies breaking could be heard.
