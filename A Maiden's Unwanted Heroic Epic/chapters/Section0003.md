## Chapter 313: Reine XIV

I wondered if I wanted to be loved.  
But did I really want to be loved?  
  
When I heard that my father had died a glorious death in battle, that’s
what I thought about.  
I’d strived so hard to be loved, yet I didn’t feel that much sadness.  
No, I only thought it was a sad thing.  
  
No one came to comfort me; I didn’t even need to say I wanted to be
alone.  
Even though there were many servants in the mansion, no one tried to
console me.  
Seeing that, I increasingly felt like I might be a heartless person.  
That’s why, I’m sure, no one approaches me.  
  
With my father dead, I am his successor.  
I stopped painting and dealt with the work he left behind, negotiating
with merchants to maintain the family’s assets.  
My father sided with the Queen – and the Queen would undoubtedly win the
war.  
From what I’d investigated, she is incredibly intelligent, possesses
great business acumen, and has personally slain many renowned warriors
on the battlefield.  
Persuading my father to support the Queen was, in any case, a good
outcome.  
  
Resulting in my father's death might have been unfortunate for him, but
the same could be said for those on the opposing side.  
At least, for me, this was better.  
If he had sided with the nobles, we might have faced execution by
association.  
  
However, whether that is a happy thing is also difficult to say.  
I don’t know why I’m alive, what meaning there is in simply surviving.  
  
—Does life have meaning without being loved by anyone?  
  
That's what I sometimes think about.  
I don’t feel so attached to this world that I dread death.  
I want to avoid suffering as much as possible; that's the extent of my
aversion.  
But everyone dies eventually.  
Perhaps it would have been better to have died sooner.  
  
To push away these pointless thoughts, I made working my daily
routine.  
I'd look at something, imagine it, and concentrate on painting it.  
I only enjoyed myself during that time.  
  
The process of selecting what I want to see, cutting it out, and shaping
it.  
Unnecessary thoughts disappear from my head, and only what I find
beautiful appears in the painting.  
Only beautiful things are contained in the finished painting.  
There are no pointless thoughts or stifled emotions there.  
  
Sometimes I wish everything, even myself, could be an inhabitant of a
painting.  
To have a normal smile, no worries, and to enjoy happiness in a
beautiful world.  
I yearn for that because such a thing doesn't exist in this world, or
for me.  
  
I worked and painted.  
In the midst of these days spent alone in the mansion, the Queen
visited.  
She seemed to be returning from the battlefield, and the mansion was
convenient for her to stay in.  
  
*‘Despite your father’s death, you’re remarkably resilient. But
unfortunately, I intend to take this house’s assets, also as
compensation for war expenses.’*  
*‘Yes, Your Majesty.’*  
*‘I’ll allow you to live a life befitting a noble. Then, eventually,
I’ll marry you off to a suitable nobleman. You’re quite beautiful, so
I’ll choose a nobleman with considerable influence.’*  
*‘Thank you, Your Majesty.’*  
  
A beautiful Queen, somewhere between a girl and a woman – with elegant
golden hair.  
Her purple eyes were like jewels, so beautiful.  
She stopped me from making tea, leaving everything to her attendant –
even a slightly older-than-ten-year-old like me could see the
suspicion.  
She casually placed a longsword and a short sword on the sofa, the hilts
within easy reach, ready to draw them at any moment.  
She was filled with suspicion, leaving no room for error.  
  
Her words left no room for argument.  
A daughter who protects her family even after her father's death—from a
‘normal’ point of view, one might sympathize, but the Queen simply
concluded with, ‘remarkably resilient.’  
From the start, she was only thinking of her own interests.  
I was treated not as a person, but as an asset of the Neras family.  
  
*‘I leave the rest to you, Venule. I shall rest.’*  
  
After giving her only her demands, she left the reception room without
waiting for her hot tea to cool.  
I sincerely think she’s amazing.  
If I could live as freely as she does, how would I see the world?  
  
*‘…Are you alright?’*  
*‘Yes, I had imagined this might happen.’*  
  
On the desk.  
The bundle of parchment I prepared to receive inheritance of the house
contained records of the Neras family's finances and asset changes.  
The Queen flipped through it, glancing at it before leaving it; Venule,
her attendant, picked it up and frowned.  
  
*‘You… did this?’*  
*‘Yes. Considering it helped Your Majesty, it wasn’t a waste.’*  
  
I considered my intelligence to be quite high.  
I had thought it to be a valuable bargaining chip, but the Queen was
probably far superior to me.  
She evaluated me as resilient, that a child had done well, nothing
more.  
A frog in a well – it simply didn't work out.  
I gave a wry smile, and Venule looked puzzled and asked me various
questions.  
  
After I told her about everything that happened, she expressed
sympathy.  
Venule was a kind, ordinary person.  
  
*‘…Are you a servant?’*  
*‘Yes. Your abilities are more than sufficient; I shall recommend you to
Her Majesty.’*  
*‘But…’*  
*‘…?’*  
  
I understand her sympathy.  
However, when I ask myself whether the Queen needs me, I doubt it.  
  
*‘I understand you sympathize with me. But Her Majesty is not that kind
of person, and worrying about me could be detrimental to you. …I am very
grateful for your offer, but I think it's best if you stop.’*  
*‘…Fufu, why are you so concerned about what I said?’*  
*‘…?’*  
  
*"It’s not the same,"* Venule said with a wry smile.  
  
*‘Worrying about me would be detrimental to you, wouldn’t it? If you
simply nodded, you could gain a little freedom as a servant of the royal
household. Or are you not interested in becoming a royal servant?’*  
*‘No…’*  
*‘…You’re kind.’*  
  
I shook my head.  
  
*‘It’s nothing like that. It’s just that…I’m not hurt enough for someone
like you, Venule, to worry about me. Even if something happens in the
future, I’ll probably feel the same.’*  
  
*"It had always been that way,"* I continued.  
My mother's death, my father's death, I dismissed them with a simple,
"it's a sad thing."  
Even if misfortune strikes in the future, I’ll probably do the same.  
I am a person who can finish it with, "It's a sad thing."  
  
*‘…There’s no need for someone like you, to go to such trouble for
someone like me. That’s all I think.’*  
  
I think the kindness of someone like Venule should be used for someone
else, not me. It was too much of a waste.  
  
*‘…Do you dislike yourself?’*  
*‘…I don’t like myself.’*  
*‘You must be very fastidious. You're really just like Reine-sama.’*  
*‘…?’*  
*‘Reine-sama was too pure, and because of that, she was hurt by various
things… she couldn’t trust anyone anymore. That’s why you two are so
alike. You try to deny yourself, and Reine-sama tries to deny others…
it's just a matter of different directions.’*  
  
Venule sat beside me and stroked my head.  
  
*‘Meeting you feels like some kind of guidance. …I want someone like you
to be by Reine-sama’s side. I think you can heal Reine’-samas heart
better than anyone else.’*  
*‘Heal…’*  
*‘Yes. …Even though I was always by her side, I couldn't do it no matter
how much I wished.’*  
  
A gentle touch, a kind voice tinged with sorrow and resignation.  
  
*‘Reine-sama has felt lonely since she was born. She has no one to
understand her, to heal her heart. That's why I want someone who knows
the same sorrow as her to be by her side. That's why I asked you to come
to the royal household as a servant – it's not just sympathy.’*  
*‘I…’*  
*‘You’re still a child, Fili. …Stop saying things that close yourself
off from possibilities. Besides, you need a goal in life.’*  
*‘A goal…?’*  
  
I nodded.  
  
*‘In a long life…it’s often more painful to just live. Like walking with
the moon as your guide, if you don't have a place to aim for, it’s just
painful.’*  
  
*"For me, it's Reine-sama,"* Venule continued.  
  
*‘For now, pretend you’ve been tricked and try to work towards the goal
I give you. Of course, it can be temporary. I can’t force you, but… if,
someday, my goal, your goal, and Reine-sama's goal overlap…just
imagining that would make me incredibly happy.’*  
*‘Just imagining it, you say?’*  
  
She nodded.  
  
*‘…There’s nothing happier than being able to imagine that.’*  
  
Somehow, I was reminded of myself when I’m painting.  
Even though I think it’s impossible, what’s painted is a shining,
beautiful world.  
I suddenly imagine the beautiful, suspicious Queen smiling at me as I
make tea.  
Something that seems impossible—yet, the more I imagine it, the happier
and more joyful the scene seems.  
  
And strangely, that feels good.  
  
That would be the start of everything.  
  
—I woke up vaguely, and she was already awake.  
She glared at me with a sullen face.  
  
“Good morning, Reine-sama. You’re up early today.”  
“It’s you who’s late.”  
“Well…fufu, I was having a nostalgic dream.”  
  
I glanced and saw that I was using her arm as a pillow and chuckled.  
Then, apologizing, I sat up with my naked body.  
Reine, her arm apparently numb, rubbed it with her hand and glared at
me.  
  
“How many times I wanted to kick you out of bed.”  
“I sense love in your restraint.”  
“Stop your sassy talk and get out of here.”  
“It’s too late to hide it now; the rumor that the Queen is inviting a
servant to her bed will spread instantly. I try to be careful, but I
feel like people suspect something.”  
“It's not that I invited you; you came here on your own.”  
  
I chuckled, shaking my shoulders as I put on my underclothes.  
  
“Yes, you are right. The Queen simply allows a servant to visit on their
own and stay until morning—I simply came on my own. Regardless of how it
looks from the outside.”  
“I'm tired of dealing with your sass in the morning.”  
“If you say that, I feel the same. I'm tired of dealing with your sass,
Your Majesty. Fufu, you should be more honest.”  
  
I put on my apron dress and got on the bed.  
Then, leaning close to Reine, whose eyes were still half-closed, I
touched her cheek and kissed her.  
Without any resistance, she accepted it.  
  
“Lately, I’ve been thinking… I think that loving someone is much happier
than being loved by someone.”  
  
I wondered if I wanted to be loved.  
But did I really want to be loved?  
  
I think the order is reversed.  
I probably wanted to love my foolish father.  
Just as an ordinary daughter.  
  
By being loved, I wanted to confirm that my love had reached him.  
I wanted to feel that I loved my father.  
  
I think loving something is the beginning of everything.  
A life without anything to love is utterly empty.  
What brings light to life is something to love.  
Whether or not you are loved is just a result.  
  
Within the great process, results are merely fleeting.  
Without worrying about being loved or not, if I have only one love,
that’s enough.  
It will shine brightly, illuminating the path before me.  
  
“I dream every day that the day will come when you will realize such
happiness, Your Majesty.”  
“What a troublesome dream.”  
“Well, but Elsreine-sama wishes for that as well.”  
  
A great light, a small light.  
While it was customary, it sounded nice to me.  
  
“All that's left is Reine-sama… starting today, pretend it's a lie, and
tell her you love her, every night, not just to Elsreine-sama. Your
perspective on the world will surely change.”  
“That’s strange, I’d rather die than say that to you.”  
“Oh, that hurts.”  
“That’s twice, Fili. Stop being sassy and get out of here already.
Because of you, my arm is numb and I couldn’t sleep well.”  
  
She said so in a bad mood, turning her face away and lying down.  
A girl and a woman, her beauty still unblemished.  
I stared at that sleeping face, finding it beautiful, and traced her
golden hair with my finger.  
  
Then, looking around the room, I said to her,  
  
“While I’m tending the flowerbeds today, I'll pick some flowers. It
seems like a flower vase will make the stark room look a little
warmer.”  
“Do whatever you like.”  
“I might even replace the paintings. I’ll choose a few of Elsreine's
paintings.”  
  
She repeated, “Do whatever you like,” and I smiled wryly.  
  
“Then, I’ll see you later.”  
  
Good night, Reine-sama.  
I left a kiss on her cheek and went outside. 
<br /><br />

  
The sky was clear blue, and fluffy clouds lined up.  
The shadows fell directly beneath, the shadow of the castle itself not
extending to the flowerbeds beside it.  
Water droplets clung to my skin, the flowers bathed in sunlight
shimmering dazzlingly, swaying in the gap of the rainbow.  
  
I liked tending the flowerbeds.  
They sprout, form buds, and then bloom.  
Repeating this process, the most fun thing is imagining what kind of
flowers these buds will bloom into.  
  
And then, drawing those imagined flowers wasn’t so bad either.  
When Elsreine comes back, it might be fun to draw them together.  
Eventually, it would be nice to paint with three of us.  
  
*‘Mother, you should do it like this.’*  
  
I could imagine her, smiling from the bottom of her heart as she taught
me such things.  
Her sullen face also came to mind.  
What would she think if she saw my paintings hanging in her room?  
She'd surely be happy.  
Her smile was always beautiful and lovely.  
  
Truly, a small gleam, as the great light wished.  
A girl as beautiful as a single jewel in the world, worthy of being
loved and longed for by her.  
  
As for her, ever so kind—she must be tired from the battlefield.  
I wanted to make it even more beautiful, so that when she returns, she
can rest without worrying about anything and feel truly happy.  
  
*‘In a long life… it’s often more painful to just live. Like walking
with the moon as your guide, if you don't have a place to aim for, it’s
just painful.’*  
  
I wish Venule, who loved her more than anyone, were here.  
If she saw her now, she would surely be happier than anyone else.  
  
What did she imagine when she chose death? Could she imagine the happy
future of the one she loved?  
I hope so, at least.  
The end of someone like her should have been happy.  
For the sake of that happy imagination, I want to believe that death
saved her.  
  
“…Venule-sama. Venule-sama and I, and Reine-sama’s desired world, is
coming soon.”  
  
Should I offer flowers at the grave today?  
Looking at one of her favorite flowers, I wondered which one to
choose.  
  
“Fili-sama, right…?”  
  
Turning around at the sound of footsteps and a voice, I tilt my head,
questioning the royal household servant—what business does someone from
the royal castle have here?  
  
“Yes. Is there something…?”  
“F-forgive me!”  
“W-Wha…?”  
  
For a moment, I couldn't understand the situation; it was more of a
shock than pain.  
I looked at the knife plunged into my side, then at the attacker's
face.  
They looked frightened, even though they were the one who stabbed me—I
had no sense of being hated.  
Were they acting on someone's orders?  
  
My strength gave out, and I collapsed to my knees.  
The sound of hurried footsteps echoed as they fled, leaving me staring
at the knife still embedded in my side.  
Whatever the case, it was clearly meant for me.  
It was fortunate that it wasn't a case of mistaken identity.  
  
Why? I wondered, and the image of Elsreine on the battlefield outside
the castle came to mind.  
Even if they both worked for the royal castle, this servant was assigned
to the mansion.  
They wouldn't know about the Queen and her servant's relationship.  
  
My side, below the ribs.  
I wondered if there was any chance of survival, then dismissed the
thought as unlikely.  
The knife was in a bad spot.  
If I could have at least twisted my body, it might have been
different.  
But even then, it was almost certainly poisoned.  
If the location of the wound wasn't fatal, that would be the extent of
any slim chance.  
It seemed that my death was certain.  
  
If that was the case, I wanted at least to imagine a happy future.  
  
But the timing couldn't be worse.  
It felt like the worst possible time to die.  
  
Someone must have intended to make the mother and daughter kill each
other.  
It might not have come to a fight to the death, but… as I thought about
it, my body felt like it was getting cold.  
  
I wished they had killed me after Elsreine returned.  
Then I would have been able to imagine a world where the two of them
spent their time laughing together.  
  
I wish I had at least put up a picture.  
If Fili knew it was there… if she knew that my mother and Fili had a
good relationship, I might have been able to imagine it a little.  
But that was just regret, and this was the end, my vision darkening.  
  
A fleeting, absurd end.  
Thinking this was it, an overwhelming sadness washed over me.  
  
Elsreine must have been very close…  
I realized I wouldn't be able to see it with my own eyes, and my graying
vision blurred and distorted.  
  
I tasted the liquid flowing down the side of my eye as I squinted at the
dazzling sunlight.  
I was surprised to find that such a thing flowed from me as well, and I
crouched down.  
  
It was meaningless to find out now.  
There was only nothingness ahead.  
  
Still, I imagined their faces one last time.  
If only I could have seen them smile, even for a moment.  
  
Repeating a now futile wish, I sank into oblivion. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
"…It's been a year since then, and yet, it's unbelievably bad. If it
were a product being sold, I'd demand a refund."  
"…Listen, you came uninvited and the first thing you say is a complaint?
I'm still practicing."  
"I don't recall ever seeing Selene-sama finish any kind of practice."  
"Yes, I did! You said the other day that the villa wasn't bad, and then
you just lazed around as you pleased!!"  
"Now, now…Kreschenta-sama, you shouldn't say such things."  
  
Next to the mansion, adjacent to Selene's workshop, stood Selene's
second workshop.  
Inside were various pigments and painted pictures.  
  
Selene, who had apparently decided to try painting, had designed and
built a new workshop, and about a year had passed since then.  
Lately, she'd been absorbed in painting—spending almost every day shut
up in there.  
  
Her sense of aesthetics weren't bad to being with, and it had been
refined through her sculpting.  
Selene, who had been painting for a year, had certainly made some
progress, but only as an amateur.  
And, apart from one person, everyone in this mansion had grown up seeing
numerous expensive works of art.  
Surpassing that standard wasn't an easy feat.  
  
Krische, who had been sitting as a model, stood up when Bery and
Kreschenta arrived, interrupting her. She looked at the painting Selene
was working on.  
With a vacant expression, she looked at it and tilted her head.  
  
“…? Um, Selene? You were drawing Krische…”  
“…I-It's still just a sketch.”  
“Um, a sketch…?”  
  
Krische compared her own appearance in the mirror to the sketch several
times.  
The more she looked, the more confused she became, and Bery hurriedly
stopped her.  
  
"W-Well, you must be tired from modeling, so Krische-sama, shall we have
some tea? I baked some cookies."  
"Oh, yes! Then Krische will make the tea."  
"Yes, please. Shall we use that desk?"  
  
Krische, who had been bored sitting still, smiled and began to prepare
the tea, while Selene sighed deeply.  
  
"I find it hard to understand why you can't even draw what you see. I've
told you this many times before, but you should give up on art. It's a
hassle to have Anne-sama dispose of the clutter."  
"Shut up…"  
  
Kreschenta, unfazed by the glare, picked up some charcoal and a pristine
white canvas.  
With a careless movement, she quickly sketched Krische, who had been
sitting in the chair a moment before, from the head down.  
  
Without any preliminary sketch, she effortlessly rendered what she saw
in charcoal, almost finishing before Krische and Bery finished making
the tea.  
She casually put down the charcoal, silently offered her hand to Bery to
clean off the charcoal smudges, pointed to her own work and Selene’s,
and said with a sigh:  
  
"Even I, as a baby, could have drawn better than Selene-sama."  
"U…"  
"Fufu, you’re quite skilled. However, you shouldn't say such mean
things."  
"Mmgh"  
"There's joy in trying various things and making gradual progress…and
being unskilled means you can enjoy the progress, so it's not a bad
thing."  
  
While stuffing a cookie into her mouth Bery hugged her.  
Selene frowned as she watched Bery lecture her.  
  
"…Oh, according to you, you're also saying that I'm bad at it, Bery."  
"W-Well, that's not what I…it's just a figure of speech. Compared to a
year ago, your paintings have made quite a lot of progress…"  
"…You're quite condescending. You're like that, aren't you?"  
"Like that…"  
"It's a masterpiece, no matter what you make, or it's a good piece of
work that conveys your feelings… I'm not saying you're making fun of me,
but it's like you're watching a child grow up with a smile, such a
condescending attitude. …How long are you going to act like my
guardian?"  
  
Bery gave a wry smile in distress.  
  
"Fine. This is a good opportunity. How about you try painting, too?"  
"W-Well, I… you see, I have work."  
"Everything except housework is like playing. I won't let you say you
don't have time. I've been wondering about this for a long time…for over
a thousand years. I want to see you create something other than cooking
and magic crystals."  
"You say something good every once in a while, Selene-sama. I, too,
would like to see Bery’s face when she can only create failed works and…
mmgh…!"  
  
Bery naturally shoved another cooking into Kreschenta and sighed.  
She glared at Bery with open dissatisfaction, but her opponent was
equally dissastisfied.  
Bery had already prepared a new cookie in front of Kreschenta's mouth,
ready to prevent her from saying any more unnecessary things.  
  
Krische, who had been watching, was already ignoring their
conversation.  
Seeing her sister being fed cookies, she looked up at Bery, seemingly
wanting one as well.  
  
"If you say so, I have no choice."  
  
While giving her cookies as well, Bery spoke as if resigned to her
fate.  
  
"That's the spirit. Let’s say the time limit is until the end of this
month. The loser gives up the right to decide on the next travel
destination. The other three will judge… I’m telling you now, bribery or
anything similar is prohibited."  
"…I don't feel very trusted."  
"…If you think you've built trust with me by looking back at your past,
I think you might have some kind of illness."  
  
Bery chuckled again, and while looking at her like that, Selene
continued.  
  
"Also, you have to do everything yourself, from beginning to end. You
can use a model, but you're not allowed to let those two idiots give you
advice. Got it?"  
"…When did the Ojou-sama become so suspicious of people? If possible,
I'd like to show the Ojou-sama her appearance when she was just a child,
but…"  
"…Are you one to be saying that? Just to be safe, I'm going to use
Krische as a model."  
"Um…Selene? Krische is still going to be modeling…?"  
"You're so easily manipulated and you always side with Bery. Don't
complain."  
"Uuu…"  
  
Krische, who seemed to want to refuse to be a model anymore, sought help
from Bery, but Bery just smiled helplessly.  
  
"I guess there's no helping it. So, those are the conditions of the
competition."  
"Yes. Watch, you’ll end up complaining and making excuses, saying it’s
surprisingly difficult to paint." 
<br /><br />

  
  
After tea, Krische was left behind in Selene's self-imposed prison.  
Kreschenta, as usual, put on a haughty face while being carried.  
  
"You seem very confident."  
"Oh, do I?"  
"You're quite straightforward. If there was a possibility of losing, you
wouldn't gamble, you would come up with all sorts of excuses and
manipulate the conditions to cause chaos. You're so childish in such
frivolous competitions."  
"That's uncalled for. I'm just trying to avoid an unfavorable battle."  
"You should say that after the odds of winning or losing against
Selene-sama become even."  
  
Bery chuckled, gazing at the mansion, wagging her finger, and carving a
formula in mid-air.  
A cat made of gathered water appeared, wriggling about, as did a bird
and a dog.  
  
"I'm used to observing various shapes, and method of drawing doesn't
matter much…"  
  
One of the cats held a water-made brush and started to draw a simple
picture of a cat in the undergrowth.  
  
"The details can be taken care of with formulas. Fufu. Well, it may be a
rather crude picture for Krische-sama and Kreschenta-sama, but…"  
"That's only natural. It’s like comparing weeds."  
"…Besides, the Ojou-sama is self-taught. I didn't spend much time on it,
but as a child, I learned the basics of painting from a tutor along with
my sister."  
  
She chuckled as she recalled her sister, who had dragged her to painting
lessons, which she hated.  
Her sister was quite clumsy and disliked painting because of it.  
  
"Because she's clumsy just like me, the Ojou-sama wasn't given a tutor…
well, for now, the conditions are pretty much the same as the
Ojou-sama's, so I guess the advantage is on my side."  
  
"The subject matter is the problem," she said, gazing at Kreschenta, who
had an openly displeased expression.  
  
"I absolutely refuse to be the model for your awful painting."  
"I wish you'd at least take a look first… Fufu, I thought you'd say
that. However, if we use the other three as models, it might be
considered an act of bribery."  
  
Without showing any signs of distress, she walked to the front of the
mansion, to the edge of the deep forest, and squinted at the mansion and
the surrounding scenery.  
  
"Gururun would be easy to draw, but if I'm going to draw, I want to make
a fun picture, not just win. A picture of everyone having a feast, or
something like that."  
"Are you going to copy Elsreine's painting?"  
"Yes, that wouldn't be bad either."  
  
Beautiful, exquisite, vivid paintings.  
She never saw them when sge was there.  
The paintings of the two princesses who divided the kingdom—no matter
how magnificent they were, displaying them would have been disrespectful
and unlucky towards the royal family, and even nobles did not dare to
display them openly.  
She had heard that Gildanstein sold many of them, and she never saw them
even after coming to live in the royal territory.  
  
"I don't think you could even reach the level of a forgery. It's
unnecessarily elaborate."  
"It’s fine. It’s all about the atmosphere. If the visual impression is
good, then everything is fine."  
"You're always so casual."  
  
Having come here, and toured various places, that was the first painting
she saw.  
An overwhelming technique, instantly recognizable.  
The two Reines, the so-called cursed children—In fact, they were
probably close to these two.  
Therefore, their deaths must have been very sad.  
  
"And, this might be just the right place."  
"…Just right?"  
"She painted many pictures of paradise, and even named a country after
it… No matter how it ended, this is probably the kind of place Elsreine
wished for."  
  
A little paradise.  
A strange name for a country.  
Not authority, not demonstration, but a land of dreams, the kind a child
would wish for.  
  
"The title is Little Paradise. …Fufu, let's call it Elsren."  
  
It sounded right, and she couldn't help but chuckle.  
A pleasant wind and air, a bright, peaceful world.  
At least, this was surely the place she once wished for.  
  
"That sounds like a masterpiece that will surely live up to its name.
It's all show and no substance, a title that suits you perfectly."  
"Fufu, it's good, isn't it? …Besides, if you're going to say that, the
one who created this place is also responsible. The model is going to be
this place, a dreamland thought up by someone who is truly
empty-headed."  
"Are you picking a fight?"  
"No, I'm just praising it as a wonderful place."  
  
Chuckling, she ignored the tugging on her hair and continued.  
  
"In a way, it’s a collaboration with Krische-sama and Kreschenta-sama.
If I draw it well and win the competition, I might put it up
somewhere."  
"Please don't add any more clutter."  
  
A shining little paradise.  
A dream birdcage where only meaningless days are repeated.  
A dream achieved by two children born into the royal family.  
A world where everything shines brightly, without the need for any
retouching.  
  
A dazzling world, vividly colored—such a place would be perfect to
paint.
