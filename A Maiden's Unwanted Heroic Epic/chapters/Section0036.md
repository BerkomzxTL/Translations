## Chapter 346: Charm V

The downfall of the Argan family—She had heard the war with Elsren was
over several months after she arrived there.  
At that time, she lived thinking only of that day, not of tomorrow, so
the days were uncertain.  
It felt as though years had passed, but no season had even completed a
cycle; it couldn't have been much time.  
  
Ultimately, that war was a great victory, and Alberan gained rich land
by carving off a large part of Elsren's territory.  
She remembered the people who participated in that gathering making
quite a fuss.  
Some with beaming smiles, others plunged into grief.  
The people who participated in that gathering, even if they were nobles,
probably had the temperament of merchants.  
People who simply pursued profit, placing bets on their own nation's
war.  
Alberan's great victory seemed to have been unexpected, and the faces of
those present changed slightly.  
  
For Lazura, nothing particularly changed.  
Only the customers who bought her flowers changed slightly, and the
whispered words adjusted accordingly.  
  
Many whispered shallow love.  
Pretending to be sympathetic, as if pitying Lazura's circumstances.  
They would say it was difficult to immediately raise the funds to cover
the debt, but they would do their utmost to help her.  
The first time she heard it, she involuntarily felt hope, then lost her
words when she saw the man with another woman.  
When she realized it was just a "game," she was disappointed in her own
foolishness.  
Many held the title of noble, but a true noble would not appear in such
a place.  
  
When it happened repeatedly, she grew accustomed to it.  
Her emotions wore away, and she met their words with a cool gaze.  
She wondered if, even if someone genuinely spoke the same words in the
future, she would be able to believe them.  
Eventually, she would probably look at such words with suspicion.  
Shaking off such thoughts, she focused on the present day.  
  
The medicine given for contraception wasn't particularly bad, but
perhaps it wasn't compatible with her.  
Her body always felt a little sluggish, and her mood tended to sink
along with it.  
Even trying to view the future optimistically, anxiety remained.  
For example, if she became gravely ill, if she couldn't work.  
She intended not to give up for years, but there was nothing she could
do about her body.  
  
At that time, Roland visited after a long absence.  
In a good mood, he told Lazura that she had quite a reputation and
mentioned that a rare customer had taken an interest.  
He didn't answer when asked who it was, and only revealed the person's
identity in the carriage, on the way to the mansion.  
  
"...His Highness?"  
"Yes. He has returned after a great victory in the war... He heard
rumors of Lazura-sama, it seems. He wanted to see you, so he came to
me."  
  
He had gone to the trouble of putting Bery in a separate carriage, so
Lazura had expected it to be an important person, but hearing this, she
understood.  
She had seen people of very high rank, like dukes, but this was the
King's brother.  
And a person rumored to receive the rank of Marshal for his military
achievements in this war.  
Aside from the King, he was a being on a cloud, at the pinnacle of all
nobility.  
He was not someone a mere baron's daughter could easily meet.  
  
"That in itself is a joyous matter... However, you know the rumors,
don't you?"  
"...I've heard them a few times."  
  
—His Highness is insane.  
Such rumors had reached Lazura's ears.  
He was once a noble prince, favored by heaven, whose future was much
anticipated, but one day he became mentally ill and indulged in abnormal
games, so the story went.  
  
This gathering was originally a collection of scoundrels.  
Among them were despicable people who gleefully told stories of how
brutally they tormented others, but even they spoke of the King's
brother, Gildanstein, with awe and fear, calling him insane.  
  
"I've also heard that he no longer engages in such games recently... but
the rumors are true. He is a person who treats others as less than
human... I once saw with my own eyes how he laughed while gouging out
the eyes of a noble who committed some disrespect, then brutally killed
him as entertainment."  
"............"  
"Regardless of what Lazura-sama thinks, I am at most a petty villain. I
treat people as commodities, so I associate with those who have sadistic
tastes, and I've seen several people whose inhibitions have completely
broken down. That person is undoubtedly one of them. You'll understand
when you meet him."  
  
Roland said with a serious face, "Do not be rude."  
  
"A merchant is someone who doesn't care if a product sells...
Lazura-sama is free to make whatever choice she wishes, and if His
Highness buys you, it's not a bad thing for me. However, even a petty
villain intends to have some compassion... It would be wise to think
carefully before deciding."  
"You're worried about me?"  
"If I can sell for the same price, I would also want to sell to a kind
master. Sometimes, even if the selling price changes a bit... well,
that's how I feel."  
  
Roland laughed and said again,  
  
"Do not think lightly of this. No matter how much you wish for death,
even that won't be permitted... There are such pains in this world."  
"...Indeed."  
  
She thought there were such things.  
Physical pain, emotional pain.  
She could imagine it would be difficult.  
  
Upon arriving at the mansion, she was led to a room.  
Before entering, she caressed her sister's cheek.  
  
"I'm going now."  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."  
  
She hadn't seen her smile in a long time.  
Her large, light brown eyes asked daily.  
  
Deeply sunken, an all-encompassing twilight, tinged with dark
expectation.  
When would her suffering end?  
  
If Lazura broke down and pleaded, Bery would gladly accept her, laughing
as she was defiled.  
Relieved from the bottom of her heart.  
  
With love as a pretext, Bery invited her to fall into depravity today.  
With love as a pretext, Lazura inflicted pain today.  
And yet, they remained by each other's side.  
Even so, they couldn't separate, couldn't let go.  
  
Lazura thought they were indeed sisters.  
They looked different, yet were so intertwined, so close.  
  
Opening the door, she saw a man sitting on a sofa.  
A beautiful young man with elegant golden hair.  
  
His chiseled features and blue eyes were deep as the bottom of a lake,
just deep—revealing an abyss that was chilling.  
Or perhaps, staring into her.  
  
In terms of nature, it would be close to Roland's gaze.  
As if appraising her, but much colder, a freezing look.  
He looked at Lazura as if truly looking at an object.  
  
She bowed her head, as if to evade his gaze.  
  
"Sit. You may go."  
"...Yes."  
  
Roland bowed and left the room without a greeting.  
A quiet fear could be felt in his voice and demeanor.  
Even Roland, who looked down on everything, had things he couldn't
control.  
  
As told, she sat on the sofa opposite him.  
She bowed her head again and sat down, saying, "Excuse me."  
  
"Your name is Lazura, I believe?"  
"Yes, Your Royal Highness."  
  
Not raising his voice.  
But there was a pressure that made an unpleasant sweat break out on her
back.  
As if her heart was being gently toyed with.  
  
Royalty must be some kind of monster.  
  
"You are said to be a prostitute. You defile your name for money, and
sleep with anyone. You're a disgrace to nobility. Do you want money that
badly?"  
  
With a single word, he could control life and death.  
She thought that people born and raised to be like that were no longer
ordinary humans.  
It seemed to seek conversation, but it wasn't; everything was like a
pronouncement.  
As if her heart would be crushed by a single word that displeased him.  
  
Perhaps her own weakness was making her see it that way.  
But whatever the case, the monster of words before her was not seeking
Lazura's answer to his questions.  
  
"Yes, Your Royal Highness. As you say."  
  
She just answered as usual, killing her emotions.  
Despite facing him, his eyes revealed nothing of what he was thinking.  
She shifted her gaze just slightly, so as not to look too deeply.  
  
"Speak your mind. I will listen."  
  
It was dangerous to try and discern his intent or emotion as if it were
an ordinary conversation.  
It felt as though everything about her was being seen through.  
She simply calmed herself down, quietly.  
  
"Of course, I won't give you money. After I'm done playing, I'll just
throw you out. You can just bow your head and leave as usual once it's
done."  
  
His lips curved into an arc, as if he were watching an amusing clown.  
He seemed to be laughing, yet he wasn't.  
In response to his mocking words, she repeated like an idiot, "Yes, Your
Royal Highness."  
  
He lounged on the sofa, poured wine, and quietly tilted his goblet.  
As he listened to the story of the Argan family and Lazura's arrival at
this place, she felt as if he perceived it as a musical performance or
something similar.  
Or perhaps the chirping of birds.  
In either case, it didn't seem as though he was receiving Lazura's words
as actual words.  
  
To him, the Argan family was a mere baron's house crawling on the
ground.  
Because this man attacked Elsren, her father died, the Argan family
fell, and even the people Lazura now had to appease at this corrupt
gathering were from declining families, forced to grovel.  
Perhaps, from his perspective, Lazura and her family were like ants or
something.  
He happened to step and crush an anthill.  
If an ant were to tell him, "My home was on the path you walked," he
likely wouldn't feel any pain or even interest.  
  
Her life story held no value for him.  
It was probably a prelude.  
To listen to her story as a mere formality, and then to make a
pronouncement.  
  
"—I see, I see. How pitiful."  
  
Having heard her story, Gildanstein spread his hands, a smile on his
face that held no mirth.  
  
"It's a tale I've grown tired of hearing, even as an accompaniment to
drinks, but I specifically summoned you. I must give you some sort of
reward. I'm in a good mood after a great victory in the war, and my
coffers are warm. I feel inclined to buy a toy, even if it's a bit
pricey. ...Look into my eyes."  
  
—His tone seemed to have changed completely.  
The mocking tone simply disappeared, leaving a mocking quality.  
A quiet command, devoid of emotion.  
Her gaze, which had been slightly averted, was drawn into his eyes as if
sucked in.  
  
"It seems you have a younger sister. I will save only her."  
  
An inexpressible, deep darkness spread in his blue eyes.  
  
"...However, I will kill you. I will cut you off from your fingertips,
peel off your skin, and make you something unrecognizable."  
  
Frozen, she couldn't look away.  
Her breath hitched, her heart felt crushed, and her internal organs felt
as if they would spill from her mouth.  
  
"Heh, you know the rumors about me, don't you? Don't think I'm testing
you."  
  
Roland's words came to mind.  
The choice was Lazura's—he must have understood this would happen.  
In fact, the mere option to choose, even in appearance, was an act of
mercy.  
For example, if the man before her wished it, Roland wouldn't be able to
refuse him in the first place.  
And naturally, Lazura had no right to refuse either.  
The words of the royal family were a declaration to everyone else.  
  
She closed her eyes for a brief moment.  
He had said it was no joke.  
Given that, to reject the Royal Prince's mercy was unthinkable.  
Yet, if she were to panic and beg for forgiveness from the bottom of her
heart, would her life be spared?  
Or would she be cast aside, having lost his interest?  
  
—But that wouldn't be the way of a noble.  
  
"Yes, Your Royal Highness. ...If you would swear to me by your name just
one thing."  
  
She opened her eyes, gazing straight at him, as if confronting him.  
It wasn't a matter of choosing or not choosing.  
Lazura had already made her choice.  
  
"...Speak."  
  
His words were cold, but this time she didn't tremble.  
Remaining calm, she spoke.  
  
"If you would grant my sister true affection and happiness from the
bottom of your heart... then I am content."  
  
Even if she lost everything, she would not defile her name.  
She would never deviate from the way of life she had set for herself.  
Even if her power fell short, a noble should live that way.  
  
Her sister intended to devote both body and soul for Lazura.  
If it were her sister here, she would say it without hesitation.  
And Lazura was Bery's sister.  
  
"If you would uphold that vow even after I go mad, then I, Lazura Argan,
also swear by my name and pledge to become Your Royal Highness's."  
  
His blue eyes held a deep darkness that seemed to hate everything in
this world.  
Strangely, in those eyes, her own large, light brown eyes seemed to
overlap.  
The dark glow of a lost hope, as if cursing even himself.  
In his eyes, a faint trace of something shimmered.  
  
They must be very similar people.  
If one wasn't pure, one wouldn't be hurt so deeply.  
  
If he swore, he would never break it.  
She felt she could believe that, at least. 
<br /><br />

  
She was sent back just as easily, with Roland saying it might be a month
later.  
Then, returning to the inn, she went to the bathroom with Bery.  
After work, if she wasn't too tired, she would cleanse herself again
there.  
The bathroom at the mansion was mixed-gender, and while Lazura alone
might have been fine, she couldn't take Bery there.  
Fortunately, this was a high-class inn.  
She often saw other women doing the same work, but because it was
separated by gender and many of the users were people in similar
situations to Lazura, the bathroom was large.  
It was early, and the place that day was like a private rental.  
  
As if polishing a jewel, her sister always washed Lazura.  
Carefully, so as not to leave a single stain.  
Lazura, too, purposely let Bery do as she pleased.  
It was an act of self-harm for her sister, but also a sacred ritual.  
For her, who lived for Lazura, the punishment of being protected by her
sister was a comfort.  
As if swelling with a hatred that made her insides boil.  
And by hurting herself in this way, she endured.  
  
It must have been far more painful than being played with herself.  
Knowing this, Lazura prioritized herself and made Bery endure it.  
If she didn't give in, she would just break somewhere else.  
  
"Okay, it's Onee-sama's turn to wash. I told you we only talked today,
didn't I?"  
"...Yes."  
  
Before, her body was not just thin but emaciated, too small.  
Now, her sister's body had gained healthy flesh, and she had grown
considerably taller.  
Eating nutritious food, sleeping well, and accompanying Lazura wherever
she walked—that kind of life was probably part of the reason.  
Compared to when she was at the mansion, her body was full of
vitality.  
Although she occasionally ran a fever, the frequency had significantly
decreased, and lately, she hadn't been feeling unwell.  
  
Lazura thought it was ironic.  
Things that couldn't be achieved at the mansion were being realized in a
place like this.  
Her sister was growing more beautiful and maturing day by day.  
  
What about next year?  
What about the year after?  
How much longer could she keep her sister bound by the pretense of
"she's still small"?  
If Lazura fell ill before then, it would be a matter of time even if she
didn't.  
  
As they immersed themselves in the bathtub, Bery snuggled close, hugging
and caressing Lazura's arm.  
Pressing her cheek against her, as if to cling.  
  
"It's comfortable with no one else here for a change. Having it all to
ourselves feels good."  
  
Lazura said, looking up at the ceiling.  
  
"You probably realize, but this time it was a high-paying customer. It
seems I can rest for a while."  
"...Is that so?"  
  
No man would take a woman called by the Royal Prince into his bed.  
The rumors would have already spread, even more so if there were
reservations.  
Either way, she couldn't work for a while, and Roland had said so.  
  
"Even if I indulge in a long sleep tomorrow to rest, I'll get bored
staying cooped up in the inn every day. The games I can play at the inn,
my playmate doesn't let me play at all."  
  
She stroked Bery's head and continued.  
  
"So, I thought, why don't we go sightseeing? I was little when Father
and the others came before, and I couldn't see anything, so I want to
see the capital a bit. Will you come with me?"  
  
"Yes," Bery replied quietly.  
  
So, they both left the bathroom, returned to their room, sat on the bed,
and wiped each other's remaining dampness.  
Bery, as always, carefully tended to Lazura's long hair.  
And it was Lazura's job to tend to her sister's long hair.  
Removing the water, combing it, and taking her time carefully, knowing
how careless she naturally was.  
During these moments, her sister's atmosphere softened just a little.  
  
She continued for a while even after the water was removed from her
smooth hair.  
As if to loosen something taut.  
Taking her long hair in her hands, smelling it, kissing it.  
  
"...Mm, beautiful."  
  
Smiling, she stroked her head as usual.  
Then, suddenly, she was pushed by the shoulder and fell back.  
  
"Nee-sama."  
  
Pushing Lazura down, her hands on Lazura's shoulders.  
Intelligent, large, light brown eyes peered into Lazura's.  
She gazed for a while, as if searching, then narrowed her eyes.  
  
"...I will always be with you, Nee-sama."  
  
Just as she had always watched Bery, Bery had always watched Lazura.  
She thought there were no secrets she could keep from this clever
sister.  
Words that sought no answer.  
  
It was a declaration, and a vow.  
Everything that would never be broken resided in those words.  
  
"...You're truly a noble, Bery."  
  
Unlike Lazura, Bery Argan didn't waver.  
Without being told by anyone, she would not hesitate for what she needed
to protect.  
Precisely because she was weaker than anyone, she was stronger than
anyone.  
No one in this world could defile this sister's name.  
  
However, that was probably not the way of a human being.  
Even if one wished for perfection, there were things that should not be
perfect.  
  
"But you are my sister."  
  
As she caressed Bery's cheek, a clear hatred resided in those eyes.  
An impossibly deep hatred, pleading for an even deeper love.  
  
Twilight colors lingering between day and night, like waiting for the
sun to set.  
Still looking slightly bright, not as sunken as the Royal Prince.  
She thought she loved Bery more than anyone, yet she also thought she
must never surrender herself.  
Lazura sank, unable to escape that sweet obsession, that gentle nightly
temptation.  
  
Pressing her nose to Bery's sinking body, she gazed intently into her
eyes.  
From the top of her head to the tip of her toes—down to every drop of
blood, everything about her sister proclaimed that she was Lazura's.  
Filled with desperate emotion, Bery's body, light as a feather, felt
heavier than anything.  
Her gaze was burning hot, as if it could scorch.  
  
Her sister always understood everything Lazura desired at that moment
and tried to give it to her.  
  
"And I am your Onee-sama."  
  
She was glad they weren't twins.  
If they were, their boundaries would surely have merged and melted
away.  
Just as her sister was drawn to Lazura's bright side,  
Lazura, too, was drawn to her sister's dark side more than anyone.  
  
Her sister, who claimed to have nothing, had and gave Lazura many things
she desired.  
If one thing split into two, it would be natural for them to try to
become one again.  
It would be sweet to surrender to that attracting force.  
  
Such a small pretense was all that held back Lazura's weak heart.  
  
She drew her closer, as if caressing the thin boundary, and kissed her
forehead.  
Bearing various thoughts and vows.  
Slowly, as if to convey it—as if gently stroking her pale pink lips with
her finger, she distanced herself.  
Sealing words, simply savoring that gentle sensation.  
  
—*I'm sorry*, she said, moving only her lips, gazing into Bery's moist
eyes.  
Lazura, telling her that she wanted to use that pretense for just a
little longer, just a bit more, was cowardly, sly, and selfish.  
Each time she confirmed their love like this, a little courage welled
up, strengthening the core of her heart.  
Even if her heart broke, Bery would love her without contempt.  
The existence of a sister she could believe in like that was the best
good luck charm for Lazura.  
  
Sacrificing Bery's pain, she repeated the ritual of love.  
As long as she did so, Lazura could surely endure.  
  
"Tomorrow will be busy, so be prepared. After you wake up and eat,
you'll give me a shoulder rub and a massage... Then, to make sure I
enjoy myself, you'll play games with me in a reasonably close match. Of
course, if I get bored and sleepy, you'll join me for a nap too."  
"...Yes."  
"If you understand, then rest today. Is that alright?"  
  
Smiling at Bery, who looked down, Lazura slipped into bed.  
And inviting her in, she gently held her and closed her eyes. 
<br /><br />

  
Two days later, she wore a one-piece dress.  
Holding hands, they walked together through the castle town.  
The sunny world, felt after a long time, seemed to shine brightly.  
Selcourt, where they had lived, was not a large city like Gurgain, but
it wasn't particularly small either.  
It had bustling crowds and vitality, and was relatively prosperous.  
However, the capital's vibrancy was incomparably greater, and coming out
of the first-class district, filled with nobles and the wealthy, into
the castle town, there was an overflowing number of people.  
  
Her sister, who hadn't changed her expression since coming here, widened
her eyes just a tiny bit.  
Even when they were there, she only went as far as the mansion garden at
most.  
For Bery, who had never been to the city, it must have been quite a
surprise.  
She had lived without even knowing that there were so many people in the
world, and that the world was so vast.  
Lazura thought that, like with the dress, she should have brought her to
the city much sooner, even if by force.  
She had no regrets about herself, only regrets about her sister.  
  
Spending time quietly in her room was the norm.  
But Bery was exceptionally curious and imaginative.  
Perhaps if her world had expanded, she would have been stimulated by
various things, and her feelings would have naturally turned outwards.  
Her dark, sunken, light brown eyes had looked bright all day today.  
It had been a long time since she had seen her sister's eyes like
that.  
  
The sun was high, illuminating everything in the world.  
The murmuring voices of people talking about something were annoyingly
cheerful.  
The same world, the same place, yet it seemed like a world impossibly
far away.  
  
A sense of alienation drowned out the sounds, she felt lonely, and a
hand holding her own gently enveloped Lazura.  
The color reflected in her sister's eyes, Lazura, too, probably held the
same color now.  
In the sunlight, yet as if gazing at the bright world from the shade—its
brilliance held a dark shadow.  
Her sister's eyes were like magical eyes from a fairy tale, enchanting
anyone who gazed into them.  
Bearing shadows in the bright world, and holding light in the dark
world.  
Her twilight eyes, neither one nor the other, captivated and entangled
people, then gently embraced them.  
They carried such a mysterious power.  
  
She might be horribly treated and killed from now on.  
But she could believe her sister would be okay because she possessed
such magical eyes.  
She felt that even the dark-eyed Royal Prince would be entangled and
embraced by these eyes.  
Because her sister, who showed shadows in a world full of light,
revealed her brilliance precisely in deep darkness.  
  
"...?"  
"No, it's nothing. How do you like the city?"  
"...There are a lot of people."  
  
Lazura gave a wry smile at her sister, who simply stated what she saw.  
She was probably thinking many things in her head.  
Her gaze subtly moved left and right, looking at the surrounding people
and shops.  
  
It was good to have many happy memories.  
Because no matter what happened next, when she looked back, she would be
able to think, "That was good."  
To have no regrets, she explored the bright world.  
  
The capital was vast. She probably couldn't see everything in a single
day.  
She wanted to visit various places during their time off and create
happy memories.  
If she could see her sister smile even once during that time, it would
be the best thing.  
Such were their games, their memory-making.  
  
"I'm a little hungry, so let's buy something from a street vendor...
Fufu, it might be fun to just eat as we walk. It's unladylike, but I've
always wanted to try it. Will you come with me?"  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."  
  
Now, she no longer cared about what others thought.  
Taking this opportunity, she decided to do everything she wanted.  
  
"Even in the capital, it's hard to find good quality items. They're just
ornate and expensive."  
"Who told you... Kose seems to have taken over the family business and
is now working as a blacksmith. It wouldn't be bad to visit him when we
get back—"  
  
Suddenly, her breath caught at the sound of a voice, and she stopped.  
And diagonally in front of them, walking as if to pass them—a familiar
young man looked at her, his eyes widening.  
  
"...Lazura?"  
"..."  
"Why are you in the capital...?"  
  
Bogan looked at Bery beside her, frowning at the lack of other
attendants.  
  
"Bogan-sama, who is this...?"  
"She is the daughter of the Argan family, with whom our family has had
dealings since my grandfather's generation," he answered in response to
the bronze-haired young man, Nozan.  
  
A familiar voice.  
Compared to the last time she saw him, he was even more refined, with
faint scars on his face.  
But one look, one listen to his voice, and she knew clearly.  
  
"And this is her sister...?"  
"...Yes, this is Bery."  
"She's a beautiful young lady, like your mother and elder sister. I am
Bogan Christand... I know your father and elder sister. You don't need
to be wary."  
  
Quietly, Bery answered, "Yes," her hand tightly gripping Lazura's.  
Unconsciously, Lazura's hand also tightened. Her voice felt a little
strained, and the question "why" filled her head.  
  
She had heard the war was over.  
He must have achieved some military distinction and been summoned to the
capital for it.  
She thought about whether he was safe after the war, but she tried her
best not to think about it.  
Because there would likely be no more opportunities to meet.  
  
"...My apologies. I have something to attend to, so if you'll excuse
me."  
  
—*I don't want him to know*, she thought.  
She pulled Bery's hand, about to walk away, when suddenly her hand was
grasped.  
  
"..."  
"...Did something happen to your father?"  
"Uh, um... My hand—"  
"—Lazura."  
  
He looked into her eyes, and her gaze wavered.  
She couldn't speak properly, felt her face contort, and couldn't hold
back.  
  
"Lazura..."  
  
Tears overflowed like a child's, unstoppable.  
Her hand, which she had been gripping, was released; her grasped hand
was let go, and Lazura's head, covering her face, was pulled into a
large embrace.  
  
"Calm down a little... Then, tell me what happened. ...I am on your
side."  
  
Her sobbing wouldn't stop, and her breathing became erratic.  
Unconsciously, both her hands clung to his jacket, wrinkling it.  
Her voice couldn't form words, she couldn't even nod. She stained his
chest with her tears.  
  
"...Nozan, I'm sorry, but—"  
"For now, I'll find a quiet place. Please wait a moment."  
"Bery, you too, is that alright?"  
"..., Yes."  
  
How must her sister have seen her in that state?  
  
Perhaps, it was a terrible betrayal.
