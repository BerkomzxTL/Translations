## Chapter 325: The Creation of Heaven and Earth, an Eternity of Journey II

Numerous small bottles lined the shelves, each containing tea leaves.  
The royal castle has a dedicated room for storing tea leaves and other
such items.  
  
"My Karen-sama. It’s been a while. Though we’ve seen each other…"  
  
Leaving the royal territory, the end of the civil war, and then
returning to the royal territory. The Christand family moved into one of
the mansions used by the royal family for lodging.  
Naturally, many familiar faces were present, and I often encountered
acquaintances.  
  
I had come to the royal castle’s warehouse to collect tea leaves. There,
I met Karen Schlotte-sama.  
She had lovely chestnut hair and was a very easygoing person.  
  
We’re both from ducal families; she came to the royal territory about
two years before me.  
She served as my mentor, and since we shared a room, we quickly became
close.  
During my time working in the royal territory, we often worked together
as a pair.  
After becoming a servant of the Christand household and returning to the
royal territory, we had exchanged glances several times from afar, but
this was the first proper conversation we’d had in a long time.  
However, unlike my smiling face,  
  
"My… goodness…"  
  
Karen-sama frowned and made a rather dubious expression upon seeing me.
Then she pressed a hand to her forehead and sighed.  
  
"It’s been a while… Haah, I still can’t believe you’re a servant by Her
Majesty the Queen’s side… The power of initiative is a frightening
thing, isn’t it?"  
"I didn’t expect things to turn out this way when I left the royal
territory…"  
  
I replied with a wry smile, leaning my back against the shelf. My only
motivation for leaving the royal castle was the simple desire to learn
by Argan-sama’s side. But, by some twist of fate, things became
tumultuous. The country was engulfed in civil war, and even more
unexpectedly, Princess Kreschenta sought refuge with the Christands.
It’s been quite a series of surprises for me.  
  
"But… being met with such stunned reactions is a little embarrassing."  
"Of course it is. Anyone would be stunned. Clumsy Anne, right beside Her
Majesty the Queen, walking around normally. I thought my eyes were going
to pop out the first time I saw you. I didn’t just double-take; I had to
look seven times to believe it."  
"S-Seven times…?"  
"Who could believe that the silly girl who went off spouting nonsense
about finding her destiny and suddenly left the royal territory would be
working at the Queen's side soon after?"  
  
Karen-sama sighed again.  
She was absolutely right, and I couldn’t deny it.  
  
"W-Well, strictly speaking, I’m not exactly a personal attendant…"  
"Oh, you’re not?"  
"The Christand household only has three servants, so that's often the
case due to our roles… but officially, Argan-sama is Her Majesty’s
attendant. In terms of servant status, abilities, and Her Majesty's
trust, I suppose I am her substitute."  
  
In reality, Argan-sama was always present at important ceremonies,
festivals, and when foreign dignitaries were visiting.  
Considering the Queen's position, this is how it should always be.  
However, Argan-sama was busy with various tasks, including managing the
Christand household's finances.  
Elvena-sama and I are with Her Majesty during less important times, and
since Elvena-sama usually assists Krische-sama, I end up attending to
Her Majesty by default.  
  
There's no explicit designation of who is Her Majesty's attendant.
Within the Christand household, it seems inconsequential (despite being
an important duty, it's often casually decided, depending on the flow of
conversation).  
However, both Elvena-sama and I agree that Argan-sama is the official
attendant.  
  
Her Majesty’s mood was easily discernible; she's in a particularly good
mood when Argan-sama is near.  
The more cheerful she is, the more she talks, and when she's in a bad
mood, she becomes taciturn.  
However, when Argan-sama is around, she spends the whole day cheerfully
complaining, demanding this and that, making requests she wouldn’t make
to Elvena-sama or me.  
Her childlike demeanor, begging for attention, was so endearing it pains
my heart.  
  
"Argan-sama is incredibly busy managing various affairs of the Christand
household, making it difficult for her to leave the mansion every
day."  
"It almost feels like there is no job that takes priority over being Her
Majesty's attendant… But if we were to hire new servants—no, well,
considering the circumstances… In this situation, having an unknown
person close to Her Majesty would be worrisome, wouldn’t it?"  
"Yes. Given Her Majesty’s position."  
  
Her Majesty is utterly charming, yet also someone who clearly separates
the public from the private. This must be due to her upbringing in an
environment I can’t even fathom.  
The fundamental premise is that her life is under threat, and she’s
incredibly cautious. She’s extremely sensitive to even the slightest
change.  
  
For example, if a room in the castle is left empty, she would notice if
the position of the tea set was slightly off, or if there were signs of
it being moved.  
Any minor change would trigger her alertness. She always has guards
stationed in any room she uses, and even forbids castle servants from
entering while she is in the castle.  
  
When I discreetly cleaned her room, she was silent for a while,
scrutinizing the entire room. After belatedly understanding what I had
been doing, she scolded me severely for causing confusion, which is
still fresh in my memory.  
  
She keeps everything, from clothing to personal items, in the mansion
because she doesn't know what could happen.  
She doesn’t keep any daily necessities or personal belongings in the
castle.  
There's a slight difference in her demeanor between when she’s in the
mansion and when she’s outside; outside, she often seems a little
tense.  
Given her personality, it seems difficult to increase the number of
people close to her.  
  
Elvena-sama was saved from slavery by Krische-sama, and feels deeply
indebted to the Christand household.  
Her sister is also a soldier under Krische-sama's command, which I
believe is why she's trusted. I came to the Christand household solely
because of Argan-sama. I didn't have the presumptuous goal of being by
Her Majesty’s side; it was purely accidental. Perhaps she believes that
a clumsy woman like me wouldn’t make a good assassin. Regardless, I have
her trust.  
  
However, given these circumstances, adding servants besides Elvena-sama
and me, who share the same roof, requires a substantial reason.  
  
The number of servants is indeed small.  
We have to leave the mansion during ceremonies and festivals, and having
someone like Karen-sama around would give us peace of mind in such
situations.  
However, I didn't think she'd keep me close just because I'm a senior
servant she trusts.  
  
"There were such stories about Her Majesty when she was young… several
princes died under suspicious circumstances, they say."  
"Yes, politics is mysterious…"  
  
It wasn’t long ago that rumors spread saying Her Majesty had killed her
brothers, the Princes. The royal world is a dangerous place rife with
intrigue; Argan-sama’s presence improves Her Majesty’s mood, because of
this aspect as well.  
  
To most people, she’d seem incredibly neurotic. I was very careful to
avoid upsetting her, paying attention to even the smallest detail. When
Argan-sama is with Her Majesty, the atmosphere is as relaxed as when she
is at the mansion. Trust and confidence—although she trusts Elvena-sama
and me, she truly confides only in Argan-sama.  
Wishing for more staff is wishful thinking—first, I must become someone
worthy of that trust, someone whose presence alleviates the lack of
staff.  
  
"It’s an enviable, yet unenviable position. The Christand household is
like a garden, there are no lords, and it must be exhausting in various
ways."  
"A garden…?"  
"Of course, serving Her Majesty the Queen and the Kingdom Marshal is
something to aspire to… but it’s only women. For someone like me,
there’s more trouble than reward…"  
"Karen-sama is rather pragmatic—"  
"Don’t be absurd. It’s normal, most servants are looking for a
partner."  
  
Karen-sama glared at me.  
  
"You're abnormal, compared to the average servant. To find happiness as
a servant… Do you intend to spend your entire life like this? What about
marriage?"  
"For now, nothing in particular… Of course, I don't completely lack a
desire for a family, but I think I'll consider such matters when the
opportunity arises."  
"At this rate, you’ll end up an old maid. You’re quite disappointing…"  
  
Karen-sama leaned closer.  
  
"You're quite absent-minded, naturally naive, and hopelessly clumsy, but
you’re from a historically renowned family, even if it’s in the
countryside. You're hardworking, kind, and cute… If I were a man, I’d
woo you."  
  
Blushing, Karen-sama chuckled and stepped back.  
  
"I… I’m nothing special… There are many more wonderful people—"  
"You’re just spoiled for choice. Living in that fairytale-like mansion
will do that to you, I guess? Cakes are delicious and beautiful, of
course, but cookies are delicious too. You're a high-quality cookie."  
"A high-quality cookie…?"  
  
It was supposed to be a compliment, but it was quite an unusual
assessment. Karen-sama sighed.  
  
"Sigh, I wish I were born with your carefree nature. You seem so
happy."  
"I think Karen-sama possesses more than enough… You’re beautiful,
skillful, and intelligent."  
"Being moderately intelligent is less stressful than being stupid.
Unless you have exceptional talent… like Selene-sama and Krische-sama…
Ah, I should address them as the Marshal and Alberinea-sama from now
on."  
  
That wasn'ta sentiment that just Karen-sama held.  
Generally, Selene-sama and Krische-sama are often mentioned in the same
breath.  
  
The daughter of the late Christand, a hero and the renowned Lightning
Quick.  
In the civil war, she took over the army at the age of fifteen, after
her father's honorable death. She defeated the Black Lion, the feared
Prince, and avenged her father's death.  
Now she’s the Marshal, and without voicing complaints, she confidently
handles her responsibilities, leading experienced veteran soldiers.  
An incredibly impressive career for someone barely fifteen years old.  
  
However, my impression of her, being close to her, is different.  
Of course, she’s amazing and exceptionally talented.  
But at the mansion, she’s always the last to leave, and even when I’m
asleep, a light leaks from her room, where she’s always working,
studying, or writing something.  
She’s not lazy, but rather someone who meticulously handles everything;
yet her hair is always slightly disheveled, and her eyes show signs of
fatigue.  
  
She stands beside the unparalleled genius, Krische-sama.  
I can vaguely understand the struggles involved. I believe Selene-sama’s
greatness lies not in her talent but in her spirit.  
She recovered quickly after her father’s death, she smiles while
commanding experienced soldiers, she forces herself to act as expected,
and she never complains.  
Since she is a girl younger than me, seeing Selene-sama makes me
straighten my posture.  
  
"Well, enough idle chatter. You’ve certainly advanced, and
congratulations. I'm sure you have many hardships, and if you need
anything, rely on me. As a senior, I'll help if I can."  
"Yes, thank you very much."  
"Leaving the Christand household aside, there must be many lovely
gentlemen around you. Doing you a favor might benefit me as well."  
"I… appreciate your frankness, Karen-sama. But perhaps you shouldn’t say
such things."  
"It's a sign that I trust you."  
  
She chuckled, took some tea leaves from the shelf, and opened the
door.  
  
"See you later. Be careful not to make mistakes and anger Her Majesty
and the others."  
"I… I’ll be careful…"  
"That’s what worries me too."  
  
With a wave, Karen-sama left.  
She remains a wonderful person.  
I smiled, seeing her off, then took the tea leaves and put them into a
small bottle, leaving the warehouse.  
  
At the entrance to the castle—the entrance hall—I unexpectedly bumped
into Selene-sama.  
Upon seeing me, she lightly raised her hand while descending the
stairs.  
  
"Good work, Selene-sama."  
"And to you. On an errand for Bery?"  
"Yes, some tea leaves."  
  
I saw the guards at the castle entrance—their posture stiffened the
moment they saw Selene-sama.  
They opened the large double doors.  
She looked at them, offered a smile. Then she went through the doors
with me.  
  
A brief interaction, yet so impressive. She was truly born to lead.  
The guards’ atmosphere was markedly different from when I had entered
earlier, tense, and stiff.  
Without exchanging words, a single smile changed everything. An
effortless grace, a dignified presence.  
She's truly impressive.  
  
"How is it? This must be like going home for you."  
"I was a servant in a guest mansion, so calling it ‘home’ is inaccurate…
Still, it’s quite surprising to meet familiar faces. I was just talking
about something similar with a senior I’m close to."  
"I can imagine. I feel out of place too. I just received the Order of
the Knight, stiff as a statue."  
  
Selene-sama laughed wryly, looking bewildered.  
  
"Krische and Bery have completely settled in, looking like they grew up
here. It's a relief to have you and Elvena around. You have a normal
sense of values."  
"A normal sense of values…?"  
"Yes. Krische is as she is, and Bery is quite strange. Even though their
living situation, status, and environment have changed, they’re back to
normal after three days. It’s a disease, a disease."  
  
Even though the way she put it was odd, I understand.  
Krische-sama seems happy as long as Argan-sama and Selene-sama are
around, and seems uninterested in her position (in fact, she acts as if
it's someone else's affair in relevant discussions).  
  
Argan-sama, for her part, met and greeted the guards, warehouse keepers,
and servants in the royal territory within the first few days, and
befriended people that I, who had lived here for many years, hadn't even
met. Even the stern guards and grumpy warehouse keepers would let her
through easily upon hearing she was on an errand for the Christand
household. Even unknown senior servants started treating me with
consideration.  
  
I think that doing what's expected, naturally and without fuss, is
extremely difficult. Doing things smoothly is ideal, and everything
should function that way, but often it doesn’t.  
There are strict people, difficult people, and malicious people.
Frictions arise anywhere, and I had struggled with them before.  
  
But since returning to the royal territory, everything has been
surprisingly smooth. I haven't been turned away at the gate because I
lacked permission, been told that I couldn't have something because
supplies were low, or been unreasonably burdened with unnecessary
tasks.  
Argan-sama, as a servant, naturally and effortlessly makes the ‘natural’
order work. In that sense, Selene-sama's statement is accurate.  
  
"Things have changed so much over here, it’s been difficult, what about
you? I just want those ordinary, normal conversations. But Krische and
Bery just say ‘it seems hard’ with a detached expression, and it’s like
I’m the only one struggling to keep up. It makes me feel stupid."  
"I… I see…"  
"Why am I the Marshal anyway? I’m barely twenty. To think about the
feelings of those people who have to call a girl like me ‘Marshal’… It’s
excruciating. Ah, I really wish I could borrow some of Krische’s
easygoing nature."  
  
She must have a lot on her mind.  
Selene-sama sighed, words seemingly spilling out from inside her one
after another.  
  
I could only understand it through a crude imagination, but it must be
unimaginably difficult.  
Even though it's a tremendous promotion, I wouldn't be able to be happy
if it happened to me.  
For example, if I were suddenly placed in a position where I could lord
it over the servants of the Ilne mansion and the royal castle, even
Argan-sama, I'd probably collapse and fall ill within three days. No, I
wouldn't even last half a day.  
  
Even the category of "servant" is frightening, yet Selene-sama is Her
Excellency, the Grand Marshal of the Kingdom.  
Nobles, to begin with, originated from warriors who served the king.  
For example, even among nobles of the same rank, due to the weight of
their duty to stand on the battlefield alongside danger and bear the
responsibility of national defense, the Kingdom has a custom of placing
military nobles above others.  
At the pinnacle of such military nobles—the Marshal—in terms of
hierarchical order, they are second only to His Majesty the King.  
In short, it's safe to say she's at the very top of all the nobles in
the kingdom.  
Therefore, prestigious predecessors like the former Duke Keithriton and
His Royal Highness the King's brother, lineage and achievements were
highly valued.  
  
Even with achievements, it's common for someone to be deemed unsuitable
for Marshal due to their family standing, resulting in a princess being
married off to them and forcefully granted a dukedom—it was normal to
adjust such inconsistencies for someone standing above all nobles, and
the fact that she's been appointed Marshal while remaining a Marquis is
an unprecedented exception.  
Objectively speaking, Selene-sama being Marshal is forceful and
inappropriate considering various factors, including etiquette and
tradition.  
  
"Well, I suppose it can't be helped. Selene-sama being Marshal is
fine."  
"Fine isn't the word! Even Father would say it's inappropriate, let
alone me! I only recently received knighthood!?"  
"Onee-sama seems completely unmotivated, and Marquis Velraigh and the
others are saying Selene-sama is suitable. If you say so, then please go
persuade them yourself again."  
"Ugh…"  
  
This discussion happened just the other day.  
From what I heard, it's only natural—the nobles under Christand seemed
to sincerely believe that Selene-sama was the most suitable for Marshal,
and it was unavoidable due to staffing issues.  
However, this was an internal matter, and it's unlikely that other
nobles will understand.  
  
"Faren…Faren is being considerate, and Kokys is running around and
talking to everyone, so it's still manageable, but every time I meet
other soldiers, I feel like I'm suffocating from the weight of the
atmosphere…"  
  
Marquis Faren, the Marshal's aide, was a former superior officer of the
previous head of the family.  
He's called by the terrifying "nickname" of "Skeleton" by Krische-sama,
but he's someone who could easily be Selene-sama's
great-great-grandfather, and the soldiers under Christand's command all
have amazing battle records.  
Even in the short time I saw them while serving as the previous head of
the family's aide, I understand that Selene-sama held strong respect for
them as her father's comrades-in-arms.  
Even considering the circumstances, simply being in a position above
them would cause quite a bit of resistance once peace returns. The
mental strain is beyond my imagination.  
  
"…Sigh, no use. If I keep complaining like this…"  
"N-no! As a servant, it's a pleasure…no, an honor to hear such
words…that is, it's an honor."  
"An honor…?"  
"I'm sorry…it's just that, alleviating even a small part of the master's
worries is…a servant's duty. Please don't hesitate to complain as much
as you like. It would be my greatest wish if it eased Selene-sama's mind
even a little."  
"H-ha…"  
  
Selene-sama had an indescribable expression. I felt ashamed of myself
for not being able to say anything clever at a time like this.  
  
"U-um…I actually aspire to share burdens and serve someone. Listening to
my master's complaints is somehow really delightful…I didn't have such
opportunities when I was in the Royal Territory before."  
"Ah, well…it seems a bit different from being a servant who serves the
household like that Bery in the mansion."  
"Yes… Even if there were guests, there wasn't a master to serve… Of
course, Her Majesty the Queen is the master, but she was a distant
figure compared to now."  
  
Selene-sama thought for a moment and smiled wryly.  
  
"Fufu, wanting to serve someone…you're a bit unusual, aren't you? Well,
considering you came to the fortress alone, aspiring to be like Bery,
this is no surprise."  
"T-that's…"  
"…But I suppose that's how it is. I…also insisted on going to the
battlefield to help Father. Of course, that wasn't the only reason."  
  
She said this with a distant, lonely look in her eyes.  
Complaints weren't allowed, during the midst of war.  
She lost her father and then recovered in a short period, took over the
army, and led them.  
I just thought she was incredibly strong, but when Selene-sama says
"Father," she looked sad, it reminded me that she was a girl of her
age.  
  
She also lost her mother early, and then her father.  
I think it's not uncommon for soldiers.  
However, just because it's not uncommon doesn't mean it's something one
can easily accept.  
  
I, on the other hand, am fortunate.  
I ran away from home after a huge fight, but everyone is still alive,
including my brothers.  
I wasn't a soldier, so I never felt that kind of anxiety.  
If even one of them died, I would cry disgracefully and dwell on it for
a while.  
I don't think I could show such a dignified appearance.  
  
Everyone in this mansion has lost many loved ones and experienced
corresponding tragedies.  
Argan-sama lost both her parents and her onee-sama, and I heard that
Krische-sama's foster parents were killed by bandits. Her Majesty the
Queen lost her personal attendant, and even from what little I know of
Elvena-sama's past, it certainly wasn't a happy life.  
  
I think there's some truth to that. Selene-sama is serious and tries to
be strong.  
Even after losing her beloved father, she wouldn't allow herself to
express her grief like a child.  
She must be enduring it because everyone has overcome their own
tragedies.  
  
Still, it's too harsh a position for a girl of ten or fifteen.  
The position of Marshal is also harsh—Kreschenta-sama is Her Majesty the
Queen, Krische-sama is Alberinea, Argan-sama manages everything in the
mansion, and everyone is incredibly talented.  
Even though she keeps saying it's not suitable for her, once it's
decided, she has no choice but to do it, and she'll try to do it.  
And if she pushes herself, she has the talent to pull it off.  
  
Whether that's good or bad, I don't know.  
  
"Well, it's too late to fret now. …Don't tell Bery that I was
complaining; it's embarrassing."  
"Y-yes…Selene-sama…"  
"I'll go back after some sword practice to clear my head. Tell Bery that
too."  
  
Arriving in front of the mansion, she said this and drew her sword from
its scabbard.  
  
She stood, poised as if staring intently at something— 
<br /><br />

"Wow…"  
  
In the garden in front of the mansion—grasping her sword, swinging the
blade, dancing gracefully with golden threads. In the blink of an eye,
countless sword flashes raced past, and the whistling of the wind
resonated in layers.  
It wasn't just swinging; she must have an opponent in her imagination.  
Sometimes she moved her body to dodge something, twisting her waist,
performing a breathtaking sword dance.  
  
Swordsmanship that was incongruous with her beautiful girlish
appearance.  
But the polished, steel-like aura and tension stole my breath, leaving
me spellbound.  
Selene-sama's swordsmanship, which Krische-sama calls clumsy, is beyond
my comprehension.  
  
My father was also quite a skilled swordsman. In his hometown, he was
known as "Marquis Giterns, a noble of both literary and martial arts."  
Watching him teach and overwhelm my brothers and the guards, I think he
was objectively quite skilled.  
  
That's why I was surprised when I first saw Selene-sama's
swordsmanship.  
Of course, I can't compare Selene-sama, a military noble born into a
martial family, directly with my father, but her swordsmanship at the
age of fifteen was incredibly dazzling and captivating. My memory of my
father's swordsmanship was honed after he turned fifty, but Selene-sama
is only fifteen—a mere child.  
I was amazed by her spirited determination and pressure, thinking,
"There are such people in the world," and, "As expected of the daughter
of the renowned Christand family."  
  
To put it mildly, Selene-sama is a genius, and on top of that, she is a
hard worker who doesn't become arrogant despite her talent and receives
respect from much older soldiers.  
Even though there were circumstances, she was appointed Marshal, and she
does it as if it were natural—she's truly outsanding, something no one
could dare deny. I learned how vast the world is by watching
Selene-sama. 
<br /><br />

  
"Whew…What do you think? Want to try, Anne?"  
"No, I…"  
"Exercise is the best way to get used to the body. I've become quite
accustomed to it, but…"  
"I thought Selene-sama was already completely used to it, but you still
have some difficulty?"  
"The finer movements…"  
  
Selene-sama opened and closed her right hand, then raised both hands.  
She arched her back and swayed her slender, supple body from side to
side.  
If Argan-sama was the epitome of condensed feminine charm, Selene-sama
was the epitome of refined feminine charm.  
Her slender waist and long limbs, even in simple training
clothes—trousers and a shirt—were beautiful enough to be unfair.  
Whether in a dress, a military uniform, or even this attire, the thought
of her not suiting anything never crossed my mind.  
  
Selene-sama twisted her waist and groaned, seemingly dissatisfied.  
In the past two months, Selene-sama seems to have completely gotten used
to this body, but there are still some minor inconsistencies.  
  
"Putting on clothes, writing, turning pages of books, there's still a
strange feeling about things I used to do without using magic. Swinging
a sword was something I've been trying to do without relying too much on
muscle power for some time, so getting used to it was quicker,
but…there's still an awkward feeling that won't go away."  
"That's certainly…"  
  
The feeling of a body you used to be able to use suddenly becoming
clumsy. Argan-sama said that it would be easier and better once you got
used to it, and it's true that moving your body by relying on magic is
less strenuous and gives you more power, but you still can't get used to
things you're not used to.  
It's quite difficult.  
  
I offered her a towel. She thanked me and took it, wiping her face and
neck. She sweats, feels pain, and is listless when she wakes up; her
hair grows too.  
In terms of sensation, there wasn't much difference from before, but we
seem to be very well-protected against injuries—I can grab a knife
without cutting my hand, and even if hit with a hammer, I won't be
injured.  
  
When I was still getting used to it, I slipped while going down the
stairs and hit the back of my head, but despite the shock that would
have killed most people, I only felt the impact; there was no pain.  
Minor pains remain as before—for example, the pain of almost crushing
Kreschenta-sama while falling—seem unchanged. It's still fresh in my
memory how Lira-sama screamed and crouched down with tears in her eyes
after apparently hitting her little finger in the bathroom.  
  
Holding your breath makes you feel short of breath, but in reality,
breathing isn't even necessary.  
Running makes you tired and breathless, but there's not much difference
in that area either; it's designed to be as close as possible to before
while being "a very strong, indestructible body." The danger is
self-destruction—losing awareness and returning to a soul state.  
Krische-sama and the others still check our bodies every day, and it's
supposed to continue for the next few years.  
  
Trying to get used to my body, she emptied her mind. When I, who had
been concentrating my magic on the so-called root, almost started on a
journey to the source, Krische-sama stayed by my side, scolding me
repeatedly for several days. Although she recently said that I had
settled down, she probably still had some anxieties. Krische-sama and
Kreschenta-sama seem to go shopping to the other world as well, but on
the first day, she didn't even allow Argan-sama, who seemed to be able
to handle her body perfectly, to accompany them until she was fully
settled. If you return to your soul state, you have to start all over
again. It seems like it will be a long time before I can go with them.  
  
"You don't have to accompany me. Do whatever you like…Bery and Krische
are enthusiastic, and there's hardly any work, right? It's not fun to
watch me swing a sword, either."  
"No, that's not true…Selene-sama's swordsmanship is impressive."  
"That's a bit embarrassing."  
  
Selene-sama smiled wryly and gazed at the sword in her hand.  
The width of the blade was slender and elegant, yet thick and
powerful.  
Selene-sama's beloved sword—a sword given to her by the previous head of
the house, which she still treasures.  
It's meticulously polished, the leather wrapped around the hilt is new,
and it looks almost brand new, but the remaining scars on the blade give
it a sense of weight.  
  
"My father also loved swords and was quite skilled…so I think I
understand the intensity."  
"Fufu, intensity, you say. I've only swung a sword in actual combat a
few times, during my first battle and the civil war. My swordsmanship
is, well, reasonably good."  
  
She said it's just "reasonably good" and laughed brightly.  
The sound and expression of her voice, like a cool breeze, was the
opposite of Argan-sama's captivating charm.  
Selene-sama has a dignified, what you might call "fighting spirit," and
she always carries an air that makes you want to straighten your back.  
  
Air—yes, it's the air.  
  
A wise yet lovely ideal servant. A young, noble, and affectionate girl
marshal. Two princesses with the talent called "Child of God," yet purer
than anyone.  
They are truly characters straight from book.  
They cherish a peaceful everyday life, but their presence and way of
life are incredibly vivid and brilliant.  
That's what probably changes the very air around them.  
  
Walking with Argan-sama, a pleasant atmosphere flows around her.  
Like wildflowers that catch your eye. Her gentle atmosphere makes those
around her smile unconsciously.  
  
Walking with Selene-sama, a glass-like, hard resonance surrounds her.  
Like a flower rooted on a steep mountain. Her noble and dignified spirit
makes those around her unconsciously straighten their posture.  
  
Walking with Krische-sama, a strange world surrounds her.  
As if you saw a walking flower.  
The fantastical fairies make those around them feel like they've
wandered into a fairy tale.  
  
Walking with Kreschenta-sama, even her footsteps echo.  
As if you had seen a legendary great flower.  
She captivates every eye and drags everyone around her into a gorgeous
picture story.  
  
—Just their presence changes everything around them.  
Everyone in the mansion I serve has that something. Like being
captivated by the dazzling moonlight even under a sky full of stars,
their brilliant radiance attracts people's attention whether they want
it or not.  
  
Even in a world where status and everything else is gone, that aura
remains unchanged.  
There must be something other than magic. Even in a world enveloped in
soft air, Selene-sama always remained dignified. 
<br /><br />

"If you're going to call that skill 'amazing,' then wouldn't your
father, who directly confronted a Suiko, be even more impressive? He was
recognized even by the warriors of Kre'Sharana."  
  
She swung her sword with a light, dancing motion, continuing.  
Blue magical power, bursting with wind, swirled and spiraled.  
  
"My swordsmanship is more of a hobby, really. I'm reasonably confident
in my skill and technique, and I think I can beat most opponents in a
one-on-one fight. But that's different. I've never wielded my sword
while staking everything on it."  
"But in the civil war, you confronted His Royal Highness, the King's
younger brother, yourself."  
"Fifteen against one, intending to win. The result was a retreat from a
losing position... Heh, as a warrior, I've never mustered true courage.
I'll always be half-baked."  
  
Her tone wasn't self-deprecating; strangely, she seemed amused.  
  
"I've never faced a wall that might be insurmountable even if I offered
my life. Unlike my father and Marquis Giterns. So, no matter how much I
hone my swordsmanship, I'll remain forever a half-baked warrior... I'll
never be as good as people like my father."  
  
Despite her words, her swordsmanship was terrifyingly beautiful.  
Having wielded a sword daily for nearly a century, the extent of her
training and effort was clearly visible.  
  
"It's nice to be praised, but my swordsmanship is just like that. If I
got too big for my britches over this, Father would laugh at me."  
  
With a final sweep, she sheathed her sword elegantly.  
Her smile was bright and devoid of any dark emotion.  
  
A person of talent, who had exerted unimaginable effort, yet who
honestly expressed her admiration and envy, and laughed as she admitted
her own immaturity.  
  
Like a finely honed blade, she was utterly beautiful.  
Her presence, like the sound of hard, clear glass, commands respect.  
And it was because this person was none other than Selene-sama.  
  
For example, Krische-sama and Kreschenta-sama were exceptional beings.  
  
They possessed the ability to fulfill any wish and were utterly pure.  
They were like finely honed blades and translucent jewels. Utterly sharp
and beautiful, and therefore fragile and easily hurt.  
Seeing them in person, witnessing their pure existence, one could
understand how difficult it was to protect, heal, and serve such
people.  
  
Argan-sama, who calmly served those two and gave them the happiness of
ordinary girls, accepting everything, was also an exceptional being.  
Perhaps she is the only one who can naturally find a place beside people
like them. In a sense, the world was complete with her; Argan-sama was
the 'mansion' itself—even if it were a poor little hut, if Argan-sama
were there, it would become the 'mansion' everyone spoke of.  
  
A special place for special people. The ideal I envision.  
A world different from the ordinary world. The world of a fairy tale.
Krische-sama, Kreschenta-sama, Argan-sama—they were all inhabitants of
such a world. They had the power to change the world simply by their
presence.  
  
Compared to Krische-sama, compared to Kreschenta-sama, compared to
Argan-sama...  
To say that she was inferior would be the height of disrespect.
Selene-sama, to someone like me, is certainly a genius—but only when
compared to them does Selene-sama seem a little bit closer to
'ordinary.'  
  
She effortlessly solves even the most difficult problems, as if it were
natural.  
The reason I find Krische-sama, Kreschenta-sama, and Argan-sama amazing
is that I can't even understand how they do it. It makes me think that
they are special people, different from me, and that it's only
natural.  
  
But I, an ordinary person, could slightly understand the enormity of
Selene-sama's efforts to reach that 'special' level, so I can't just sum
it up with a single word, "amazing."  
  
She always said she wasn't special at all, yet she worked desperately,
accumulating various things, and above all, her very aura spoke of it.
Everyone felt it, which is why everyone at the time pledged their
unwavering loyalty to that young marshal.  
  
Selene-sama is extraordinary, and because she isn't special, she's
special.  
That's probably what it is, I think.  
  
Deeply compassionate towards others, yet frighteningly strict with
herself. Someone who had continued through blood, sweat, and tears more
than anyone else. Yet, in her smile, which easily brushes aside even her
own efforts, there is only beauty.  
  
—Ah.  
  
It really does make my chest tighten.  
  
"Uh, um... Why are you crying...?"  
"Oh, I'm sorry... I got a little too moved..."  
"Was there anything in my story that would move you to tears...?"  
  
As I wiped my eyes with a handkerchief, she patted my head gently, and a
sigh echoed.  
Even without looking, I could picture Selene-sama's usual gentle,
bewildered smile.  
  
"Selene, breakfast is ready... Uh, Anne, why are you crying?"  
"I don't know..."  
"I-I'm sorry..."  
  
Another sigh, and I smiled through my tears. 
<br /><br />
