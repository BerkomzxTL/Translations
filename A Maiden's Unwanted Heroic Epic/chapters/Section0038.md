## Chapter 348: Charm VII

The relationship between the sisters was a little too deep, a little too
much.  
Bogan vaguely understood this.  
He understood that he was, in a way, taking away the sister on whom the
other depended, but he cared for Bery a great deal and often spoke to
her.  
  
He knew that Bery sometimes watched Bogan training.  
That was probably why Bogan suggested she try moving her body a bit.  
When Bogan made the suggestion, Bery said she wanted to learn
self-defense, and from then on, she trained whenever she had free
time.  
  
That day, after their practice, Bery returned to the room and Lazura
handed Bogan a towel.  
  
"...Her improvement is astonishing," he said quietly, and Lazura
chuckled.  
  
"That child is a genius at whatever she tries."  
"Of course, her talent itself is remarkable, but... her eyes are
different. They're the eyes of someone who has a goal."  
"A goal?"  
"She's training with a purpose. She's calm. It might have looked like
she was being completely dominated, didn't it?"  
"...? Yes."  
  
Bery practiced in her free time.  
Naturally, Lazura also had free time, and she always watched their
training.  
Today's result was the same as always.  
No matter how talented Bery was, an overnight victory against Bogan,
known for his swordsmanship, was impossible.  
  
Lazura tilted her head, not understanding what he meant, and Bogan
continued with a serious expression.  
  
"Today, I deliberately used a rough sword, intending to frustrate
her."  
"Deliberately?"  
"Sometimes, anger is necessary. Strong emotions naturally manifest
outwards... I thought she, who tends to internalize, needed something
like that. I thought a child her age would get at least a little
heated... but this is what they mean by not a ripple in the water."  
  
The result was the same as usual, and Bery, too, remained as calm as
ever.  
She easily learned and mastered techniques to disarm an opponent without
weapons, simply by understanding the principles. In sword training, she
showed only slight surprise at first when a sword was pointed at her,
but after that, she remained calm.  
She wasn't the type to struggle stubbornly, nor would she avoid
something if she realized it was impossible.  
Today's training was the same.  
  
She understood that there were various ways to use a swordâ€”a clean sword
and a rough sword. Bogan was swinging his sword a little more roughly
than usual.  
He was deliberately aiming to strike Bery's sword down.  
  
Until now, it had been quiet; they didn't directly clash swords.  
Considering the force of a sword, it would easily injure or break a
wrist, and even if not, if the sword broke, it could lead to a serious
injury, so they avoided such actions.  
Before, there was only sound was the whooshing of their swords. So when
Bogan struck Bery's sword down three times early in the practice, Lazura
was a little worried.  
However, Bery said she was fine, and indeed, her hand didn't seem
injured.  
Bogan must have known she wouldn't push herself too hard.  
  
When he said he deliberately struck down her sword to frustrate her, it
made some sense.  
It was just a guess, but from the perspective of the person being
attacked, having their sword repeatedly struck down must be more
irritating than simply having a sword pointed at them.  
If it were Lazura, she would have been annoyed after the first strike.  
  
"If she sees a sword she can't block, she immediately gives up and just
observes. She grasps the movements of my body and magic... she doesn't
show any sign of struggling to try and win against me."  
"That's..."  
"There's some truth to what those who say training should be like real
combat say, but there are few people who can approach practice so
sincerely, treat it as practice, and learn by eliminating emotions. Even
I still get heated when sparring with Nozan or Kokys. The only people
who don't are those who harbor something deep in their hearts."  
  
Bogan said he was reminded a little of the captain.  
  
"She doesn't feel ashamed of losing in practice, but hungrily takes it
as her own nourishment. In sword sparring, no one can learn 10 out of
10. Emotions get in the way, habits emerge, and one is swayed by one's
own body; at most, it's an accumulation of one or two things... even
with talent, maybe three or four. But that child calmly tries to learn
something infinitely close to 10. ...Normally, that's impossible."  
  
He gazed at the sword in his hand and continued.  
  
"The captain was a true soldier. A sword, after all, is merely one means
to win... Commander Faren is also such a person. They refine it as a
means, but they never mistake the means for the end. However, for an
eleven-year-old child who knows nothing of war, that's an unusually
harsh way to learn. To simply learn without the joy of improvement or
the frustration of immaturity..."  
"...Purpose."  
"It's easy to imagine."  
  
Lazura nodded quietly. Living peacefully, having happiness, there's no
need to wield a sword.  
  
"She's always been like that, so I didn't notice it until now."  
"Is that so?"  
"Yes. She gets so engrossed until she can do it, that child."  
  
Both meaningful and meaningless things.  
She sighed deeply. If Bery were to point her blade at anyone, her target
would be just one person.  
  
"...What should I even say?"  
"She's a smart child. She won't think of anything reckless like 'right
now.' Whatever her purpose, I don't think it's bad for her to look
outwards. Besides, with that much talent... the more options, the
better."  
  
Lazura glared at Bogan at his words, and he gave a wry smile.  
  
"It's an adult's role to broaden a child's talent, just a general
principle. It's too much of a waste to let such talent sleep as just a
servant."  
"Please, don't tempt her to become a soldier in the future. Of course,
if she says so herself, I'll consider it."  
"I'll be careful."  
  
She looked at Bogan, who was smiling, and exhaled.  
  
"She's my pride and joy, that child; she could become a truly
magnificent and respectable soldier. But I don't think she's a child who
should be placed in a world of superiority and inferiority."  
"...Hmm."  
"For a child who can achieve results so quickly, the process is more
important. If she puts herself in a world where results are everything
and correct, she'd probably do anything without hesitation."  
  
Leaning her back against the wall, she looked up at the still high
sky.  
A world illuminated by the brilliant sun.  
Bogan often said he didn't like war, but in his eyes, even the tragic
battlefield probably felt continuous with this place, and brilliant.  
As a noble place where honorable warriors would stake their lives.  
  
"For example, shooting down the great Elsren warrior who remained at the
end with an arrow."  
"...Indeed, that's quite a difficult problem."  
"Even war is a human endeavor. You acknowledge that side of it, too,
which is why, even in a world where results are everything, you cherish
the process, don't you? I really like that contradiction in you."  
  
A soldier, yet also a warrior.  
She thought his paradoxical values were very beautiful.  
No matter how cruel the world, he wielded his sword while upholding a
human boundary, and yet achieved military success; Bogan was an ideal
warrior and hero.  
That's why Lazura could accept his stories of the battlefield.  
Despite being a cruel world, it was also brilliant and beautiful.  
Like a boy whose eyes sparkle at tales of heroes, Bogan still possessed
such a heart.  
  
"But I want that child to be able to worry about various things. I think
it's far more important for her to worry about trivial things, like
'what should I make for dinner tonight' as a mere servant. ...Even
though whatever she makes is delicious."  
  
She chuckled, shaking her shoulders, recalling Bery's face as she
deliberated over the menu.  
If she were to say, "A sister should be able to guess what her Onee-sama
wants to eat," Bery would only worry more and look troubled.  
Bery's home cooking, made with such effort, was always what Lazura
wanted to eat.  
But she would never tell her that.  
  
"I understand what you're trying to say... but process and result, it's
difficult. As a soldier, there are still times when I think only the
result matters. Not being able to do so is proof of my immaturity as a
soldier."  
"Perhaps... but whether you're a soldier or not, before all that, we can
say we're in a great process, can't we?"  
  
She placed her hand on Bogan's cheek and smiled.  
  
"Only when there's a life, does that way of living come into being.
Walking a difficult path or waiting for dusk by a great tree are both
ways of living, but..."  
  
She stood on her tiptoes and gave him a light kiss, as if just
touching.  
  
"A life that you realize has ended only when dusk falls is a sad one."  
  
Bogan gave a wry smile and gently stroked Lazura's head.  
  
"You're sometimes like a teacher."  
"Oh, do you dislike the teacher's lectures?"  
"I was originally a child who liked to play outside. I still get scolded
by Teacher Faren. ...It's fine to practice with subordinates. But
considering my position, do you understand whether swordsmanship or
academics are more important?"  
  
As Bogan mimicked the voice, Lazura giggled and took his arm.  
A thin, bony face.  
He was an imposing, older legion commander.  
He had apparently been Bogan's superior at one point, and Lazura had
seen him scolding Bogan several times.  
  
"When I was a child, I'd run away from studies and swing a sword... I
behaved as if academics would be of no use to my future, but I've been
cornered now and can't escape. The child I taught, acting like a
teacher, has now reversed our positions... I regret my lack of
learning."  
"Oh my. Fufu, well, you'll have to work hard from now on, then. For
children, a father to look up to, who answers anything they ask, will
try to teach them various things. ...They'll surely ask you all sorts of
questions with sparkling, respectful eyes."  
"If even my own children become my teachers, I'll be at a loss. I'll do
my best."  
  
"Yes," she said, smiling and nodding. 
<br /><br />

  
Married life was simply blissful.  
It was troubling that they couldn't have children easily, but she often
heard that it was difficult for nobles to conceive.  
It was rare for one wife to bear three or four children, and the Argan
family was not a prolific lineage.  
She knew that, but still, when it came to her own body, she felt a
little anxious.  
  
She had used contraceptives before, so she decided to consult a doctor
early on, but even then, she didn't conceive for a year, and the child
she finally did conceive was miscarried soon after.  
When she apologized, he smiled and told her not to worry.  
They had already been discussing what to name the child.  
Bogan's strength and kindness, forcing a smile not to show his sadness
and to care for Lazura, sometimes felt painful.  
And strong light sometimes casts deep shadows.  
  
A round moon floated in the sky.  
Gentle light stained the night.  
With a blanket draped over her shoulders, she leaned on the railing,
gazing vaguely at the night breeze.  
  
"You'll catch a cold."  
"...I have a little sister who won't let me catch a cold, so I'm
fine."  
  
She reached out her hand without looking back, and a faintly warm wooden
cup was placed in it.  
Heated milk steamed gently.  
  
"It's beautiful, isn't it?"  
"Yes. I wish I could be like that."  
  
She sipped her milk and told her sister, who stood beside her.  
  
"Shining beautifully even at night, dissolving into the sky in the
morning. Never casting a shadow, staying beautiful."  
"Nee-sama, you are already such a person. If anything, perhaps the
sun."  
"The sun doesn't cast shadows."  
"There would be clouds. And night, in a way, can be said to be the
shadow of the earth."  
"...Don't pay attention to the little things."  
  
Her sister chuckled.  
Casting shadows on a bright world, shining gently in a dark one.  
  
Bogan's world was very beautiful and bright, but sometimes, her own
shadow seemed to deepen.  
At such times, her sister was always by her side.  
  
Staying by her without saying anything, looking up at the sky together,
drinking warm milk.  
That was all she needed.  
The way Bery traced her lips with her fingertip conveyed her concern so
painfully that even the despair she had been trapped in blurred into the
sky and vanished.  
  
It was sad that she had lost the child.  
Such sad things would surely happen again in the future.  
But there was someone who was just as heartbrokenâ€”or perhaps even more
soâ€”and worried about her.  
Lazura was fortunate.  
What she needed to do was not to spend her days crying, but to cherish
such a person.  
  
"...If I have a girl, I wonder if I should name her Selene."  
"Selene?"  
"Yes. Not as dazzling as the sun, but a child who can gently illuminate
the night. A wonderful girl who can shine on her own again, even after
waxing and waning."  
  
The goddess of the moon with three faces. Or perhaps three sisters.  
Waning and waxing, then waning again.  
The most radiant form of the moon was Shar Selene.  
The goddess of beauty, who illuminates the night and guides travelers,
their protector.  
One who nobly moves forward.  
  
"It might be a bit common, but..."  
"No. It's a wonderful name... I actually think it's quite rare, and it
shouldn't be a name found in the royal family for several
generations."  
"Really. Then it's decided... if it's a girl, I'll name her Selene."  
  
Lazura was someone who couldn't stand alone.  
A weak person who could only stand by leaning on her sister.  
Bogan felt that Bery was dependent on Lazura, but in reality, that
wasn't the case.  
Lazura, too, was probably just as dependent on her sister.  
  
The world wasn't as beautiful as she imagined it to be as a child.  
It wasn't all bright; there were many dark parts, and Lazura, for
example, was a weak person who would avert her eyes from such
realities.  
The two sisters were like two sides of a coin.  
If one side turned up tails, the other would shine as heads, two in
one.  
Her sister, who usually troubled Lazura, on such nights, worried and
stayed by her sister's side.  
  
She couldn't imagine being without her sister, like a missing half.  
If you called it love, it was love, but still, it was probably never a
healthy relationship.  
If one could stand alone, it would be mutual support and help.  
Their sisterly bond was something deeper than dependence.  
  
They stood by leaning on each other, and that couldn't be called
self-reliance.  
One could say they were happier than anyone, yet it was also
distorted.  
  
"I actually wish I had a younger brother or sister, just as I have you,
but Bogan doesn't seem to want to take another wife, and it seems
difficult for me to have a second child after all. I want a healthy
child like that to be born. A child who can be strong, knowing
weakness."  
"If it's Nee-sama and the Head of the Household's child, they'll be
fine. I'm sure they'll be very energetic."  
"I certainly think I'm the most wonderful, beautiful, and flawless
Onee-sama in the world, but sometimes you overestimate me."  
"Aside from what you're saying, I feel like that doesn't sound like
overestimation at all..."  
  
"You silly girl," Lazura laughed.  
  
"As your Onee-sama, that's just how it is. Beautiful or not, I'm just
like you. I'm not particularly grand or strong. I just wallow in
meaningless sadness like this, waiting for my sister to comfort me."  
  
She said, and hugged Bery from behind.  
Day by day, her sister grew softer and more beautiful.  
Bery's hand gently caressed Lazura's cheek.  
  
"So, will you sleep with me tonight?"  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."  
  
They both finished their milk and then slipped into bed.  
Naturally, Bery pulled Lazura's head to her chest.  
Contrary to their usual positions, Bery rested her cheek on Lazura's
head, as Lazura often did for her.  
  
"I'll stop being weepy starting today. It's pathetic and unsightly."  
"...Yes."  
"I'll make sure the child born will be a super energetic one. The
healthiest in the world, running around the mansion, even a little
silly, abandoning studies to playâ€”that's just right."  
  
"Yes," Bery said, gently, gently stroking Lazura's head.  
  
"A cheerful child who laughs a lot and cries a lot. ...Next time, I'll
definitely give birth to such a child."  
"..., Yes."  
"So, for a while, please pretend you didn't see this. Forget it by
tomorrow. This is an order from your Onee-sama. ...Understood?"  
"Yes. ...I swear on this name."  
  
She said, and hugged Lazura's head tightly.  
Lazura pressed her face into Bery's slightly swollen chest, wetting it
with tears and letting out sobs.  
She simply cried until all her regret and sorrow were exhausted, and her
sister's hand simply stroked her pathetic older sister's head.  
They embraced until the night seemed to melt them away.  
The next morning, everything was as usual, as if nothing had happened.  
The tears remained in her sister's heart.  
  
When Bogan returned from work, she smiled and said, "Let's do our best
again."  
Bogan smiled, relieved, saying, "You truly are a strong woman."  
Lazura, too, felt relieved, believing this was her true self.  
  
Taking the best parts, cunning.  
A bad woman who smiled, changing the person she depended on as the
situation called for it.  
But since these two pampered her so much, it couldn't be helped.  
  
Then, a little over a year later, the newborn was named Selene.  
An incredibly noisy, energetic child, not caring at all that Lazura had
been a little unwell after childbirth.  
Just as she had wished, appropriately silly and cute.  
  
Surely, she herself had been such a baby.  
  
Kissing her forehead, a good luck charm to keep the bad parts from being
inherited.  
Even if she did, as long as she grew up healthy.  
It was such a charm.  
  
The small baby laughed foolishly at the kiss.
