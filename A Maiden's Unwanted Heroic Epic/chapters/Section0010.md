## Chapter 320: Obligation VI

—When she entered the kitchen, she found the red-haired servant there.  
Her hair, which used to reach her shoulders, had somehow grown long, now
reaching her back.  
With only a single magic lamp lit and moonlight streaming in, the softly
glowing kitchen, and her white nightgown, the view of her back was
beautiful, as if melting into the light.  
  
"Would you like some too, Anne-sama?"  
"Eh?"  
  
Her words came before she turned around.  
Anne was slightly surprised and nodded at Bery's smile as she looked at
her.  
Bery then poured more milk into the pot.  
  
"Um, I guess you can tell from footsteps and things...?"  
"Yes."  
"...That's amazing."  
  
When she honestly told her that, Bery gave a wry smile and said she was
just joking.  
  
"Unlike Krische-sama, with just the way the door opens or footsteps, I
can't be certain. But the light was still leaking from your room, and
you seemed to have made hot milk last night, so I just figured it was
Anne-sama."  
"Ah, I see..."  
  
She smiled mischievously, saying "It's a little trick," and put the milk
in the refrigerator.  
Regardless, it was amazing that she could be so certain.  
Bery spoke before Anne could say anything.  
  
"...Are you worried?"  
"Ah... yes, I am."  
  
Bery rarely joked.  
When she did, it was usually with Krische, Selene, or Kreschenta—at
least, she had never spoken such words to Anne.  
But she sensed the kind intent behind her joke, and it somehow made her
happy.  
  
A letter had arrived from the capital recently, stating that before
formal relations had  begun.  
Her father intended to visit Kre'Sharana and spend some time there
learning about their culture.  
Kreschenta had granted permission, and her father was probably in
Kre'Sharana right about now.  
  
Just yesterday, this topic came up at dinner.  
Selene asked, and Krische recounted her experience venturing into those
mountains for Bery's sake, but Kre'Sharana was a harsh land.  
It was said that there were monstrous beasts like "Gururuns"—and
ferocious ones at that—all over the place.  
  
She spoke casually, as if magical beasts were merely hunting prey,
lamenting that she had discarded large amounts of hunted beast meat,
which in retrospect was a waste.  
Still, it was easy to understand how terrifying that world must be.  
The first time Anne  saw a Gururun, she was so scared she turned pale.  
She got used to it because Krische and Bery repeatedly assured her it
was fine, and she saw them indulging it.  
Now Anne even found it cute, but that was only because Gururun was
exceptionally docile.  
  
She knew that a single magical beast could easily annihilate a century,
and there was no doubt about it when she saw Gururun's physique and
physical abilities.  
  
Her father was spending time in mountains filled with such magical
beasts.  
The thought of it made it hard for her to sleep at night.  
  
"Eh?"  
  
In front of Anne, a white cat floated, with a tiny honey-colored cat on
its head.  
The two raised both their paws and opened their mouths wide, pretending
to pounce on Anne.  
Their actions were somehow adorable—and as a mug was handed to Anne, the
cats walked through the air and into it.  
The large cat turned into steaming milk, and the small honey-colored cat
seemed to swim on its surface, dissolving and blending in.  
  
She stared blankly at the mug, then looked up.  
Bery, with a faint blue glow remaining on her fingertips, gave a wry
smile and asked, "How is it?"  
  
"It's just a bit of fun, really."  
"...Like a witch from a fairy tale."  
"Fufu, thank you."  
  
Anne smiled, cupping the mug with both hands.  
It was a secret just for them, and everyone had been told what it was.  
She inscribed spells in the air and cast magic without relying on magic
crystals.  
That must be truly amazing—yet, she wasn't all that surprised.  
This mansion was like something out of a fairy tale, filled with
wonders.  
  
But regardless of that, the woman in front of Anne seemed like a witch
or something.  
In that single moment, she made her dark anxieties disappear somewhere,
making Anne feel as safe as a child.  
As she put the honey-mixed milk to her lips, Bery gently stroked her
head and said,  
  
"Anne-sama, you truly have a beautiful smile."  
"...I apologize. I've failed as a servant."  
  
She must have had a gloomy look on her face.  
When she said that, Bery replied, "Not at all."  
  
"I am also quite the worrier, so I understand your feelings to some
extent."  
"...Yes."  
"I cannot irresponsibly say that your father will be fine... But,
sharing worries can lighten them a little. Please don't overexert
yourself alone; always feel free to tell me."  
  
She smiled softly and gently cupped her cheeks with both hands.  
  
"How about it? It seems the Ojou-sama is diligently staying up late
again, saying she's busy, busy. I'm thinking of going to bother her.
...Would Anne-sama like to come along?"  
"...Yes. Hehe, I'll join you."  
  
When they left, light still spilling from Selene's room was visible.  
More diligent and hardworking than anyone, Selene effortlessly pushed
herself every day.  
She probably spent her days worrying about Anne, worrying about Elvena,
worrying about Krische and Kreschenta.  
  
*"—One must start with form. Just as one cannot walk if one cannot see
what is ahead, it is important to know what one is aiming for. I am glad
you have found a temporary goal. But—"*  
*"Yes, Father! I aim to be a servant like the one in that story!"*  
*"...U-uhm..."*  
  
She was the fairy tale servant Anne admired.  
Anne understood that she couldn't be like her, but even so, striving for
it—that, above all else, would surely be a good thing.   
Her father, too, said it was so, and for that obligation, he went to
Kre'Sharana.  
  
"My father is one of the people I deeply respect... He is a wonderful
father, and a wonderful noble."  
"...Yes. I, too, believe he is a most distinguished gentleman."  
"Therefore, no matter how dangerous the task... I will believe that he
will surely fulfill his obligation as a noble splendidly and return."  
  
"Yes," she nodded happily.  
  
"When you think about it alone, you inevitably worry... Even if you
think it's okay, even with someone as strong as Krische-sama, I still
worry when she goes to the battlefield."  
"Haa... Like Argan-sama now, I'm just ashamed that I couldn't be a
little more considerate..."  
"Not at all. On the contrary, Anne-sama, you have helped me a great
deal, you just haven't realized it."  
  
"Shall we go?" Bery said, pouring milk into the mug.  
Anne took Selene's milk first, replied "Yes," and followed her out of
the kitchen.  
  
"The Ojou-sama is probably grumbling with a difficult expression right
now. Let's watch her myriad expressions, chat idly, and slowly drink our
milk."  
"...She might get angry."  
"Fufu, it's fine. What matters is not what you do, but why you do it."  
  
She raised a finger and spun around.  
The hem of her nightgown swirled softly, reflecting the gentle moonlight
streaming through the window.  
  
"Tidying up chores and taking care of things to help the master's work
progress is part of the job. Making a master who stays up late angry,
making them lose motivation and want to give up work... Sometimes, being
complained about is also part of the job."  
  
And then, she smiled mischievously.  
  
"That, too, is an important duty of a servant." 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
―He hurled the wine bottle right in front of the Suiko's eyes.  
Then, he shattered it with the flat of his beloved sword.  
Along with the fragments, a powerfully scented perfume was scattered.  
  
He ducked, almost falling, narrowly dodging its mighty arm, and
immediately stood up again.  
The Suiko, having received a large amount of perfume on its face, roared
in a terrifying scream, thrashing about and wiping its face with its
paws.  
  
The people of Kre'Sharana disliked adornments.  
Perfume was one of the gifts he had considered bringing, but it hadn't
been accepted.  
Now, however, he was deeply grateful to his wife for suggesting it.  
  
A small bottle of perfume cost dozens of silver coins—it was meant to be
used in tiny amounts to subtly scent oneself.  
If pure perfume was sprayed directly on the face, even a human would
choke.  
For a Suiko, with its superior sense of smell, the torment must be
incomparable to that of a human.  
  
He stood up, certain it had worked.  
Yet, the sword in his hand still trembled, and his legs were rooted to
the spot.  
  
With a single roar, it shook the heavens and earth, numbing him to his
core.  
The sight of the rampaging giant beast, now in the brightly lit
clearing, more vividly revealed its ferocity.  
Its rolling, flailing arm effortlessly swept away the sturdy stone
masonry of a well frame, and seeing its form, he clearly understood his
own insignificance.  
  
"Ugh..."  
  
His instincts screamed at him to flee.  
His legs felt like stone, and his breathing almost stopped.  
A part of him praised himself, "You've done enough," and images of his
wife and children flashed before his eyes.  
If he died here, he would never see his wife or children again.  
His whole body pleaded not to die, trembling with fear.  
  
"Marquis!"  
"Marquis! Flee!!"  
  
Startled by the voices from above and behind him, he gripped his sword
so tightly it was painful.  
He replaced his fear with the pain and stepped forward.  
For a moment, regret for stepping forward washed over him.  
  
—Had there ever been such a long instant in his life?  
He remembered his younger brother's sword, still burned into his eyes.  
He recalled his brother's respectful gaze toward Argoshe.  
His body moved forward, while his mind seemed to regress to the past.  
He recalled his father's words, and pictured himself speaking those
words to his brother as if they were his own.  
  
Birth alone is not proof of nobility.  
To fulfill that duty, simply and earnestly.  
That very dedication of one's entire self is what makes a noble,
noble.  
  
Behind him were the weak he had to protect.  
Before him was a terrifying monster.  
Argoshe had not yet fulfilled his duty.  
  
*"There are many sword arts, each with its merits. But this Zain sword
is the most fitting for a noble. It is not about defending, but about
stepping in, piercing, and killing the opponent before they can act. It
is a sword that cowards cannot wield; it cannot be wielded without
self-training, belief in the sword, and the resolve to risk one's
life."*  
  
He recalled the teachings of his master, who had been invited as a guest
in his childhood, and pointed the tip of his sword forward.  
He transformed his entire body into a blade meant only to pierce the
opponent.  
He turned his limbs into weapons, fearing no death, dedicating
everything to unleashing his training.  
From the remaining five paces, he contracted and twisted his whole body
like a spring, launching himself like an arrow from a taut
bowstring—reaching a speed he himself could no longer perceive,  
  
"—!!"  
  
With all his refined might, he thrust his blade into the Suiko's
belly.  
There was no sensation of piercing flesh, only up to the mid-point.  
He heard a shriek as he pulled out the plunged blade and took a
stance.  
  
"Guh!?"  
  
He was sent flying by a blow from its mighty arm, suspended in
mid-air.  
He was thrown several paces, destroyed a barrel in front of a house, and
tumbled, coughing.  
His supposedly sturdy leather armor was caved in, and a dull ache in his
chest—a broken rib, a cracked one, or perhaps internal organs.  
He couldn't move from the pain, yet he desperately tried to get up.  
  
He must have plunged the blade a foot deep.  
Yet, the Suiko rose to its feet, letting out an earth-shattering roar.  
And its enraged eyes were fixed on Argoshe.  
  
—Regret.  
It was the best strike of his life, as far as he could imagine.  
He had never swung such a sword.  
Yet, the beast before him was on a higher level—it didn't care about
Argoshe's desperate strike and was closing in on him.  
  
He was about to close his eyes to inevitable death when,  
  
"—Save the Marquis!!"  
  
His eyes snapped open at the resounding voice.  
It was his subordinates, drawing their swords or grasping their spears,
charging toward the Suiko.  
Dodging a thrown spear, the Suiko leaped back, and the men spread out in
pairs.  
Arrows were fired at the Suiko from above, several sticking into it, and
spears were thrust into the ground to form a wall between Argoshe and
the beast.  
  
"Don't let it get near the Marquis, even if it costs your lives!"  
"C-Cax...!"  
"Marquis, we'll buy you time!! Flee!!"  
  
Just as Argoshe was trying to fulfill his duty as a noble.  
He realized they too were trying to fulfill their duty as guards, his
eyes widened—then a smile spread across his face, and he gripped his
sword again.  
Killing the pain, he stood up and stepped forward.  
  
"Tch, I won't run! Assist me!!"  
"..., Yes, sir!!"  
  
His body ached so much he could barely move, but he was a magic
wielder.  
He simply focused on the flow of magic, manipulating the virtual muscles
constructed by magic, and willed himself forward.   
Even if he were to be clumsily killed, at this very moment, he would
fulfill his duty.  
As long as he breathed, as long as his life didn't end, he would bite
down and buy time, his gaze fixed only on his duty.  
  
He grabbed a spear thrust in front of him and threw it at the Suiko with
all his might, and the others followed suit.  
All six who had descended were magic wielders.  
Their thrown spears would be an effective blow against the Suiko.  
Not a single trained spear missed, but the Suiko dodged.  
It hid behind houses to avoid them, and the arrows from the men on the
watchtowers revealed its position.  
  
Still, it was a magical beast—not comparable to a human.  
Though wounded, it dodged arrows and spears, ran at incredible speed,
easily leaped over houses, and came toward him.  
  
"—!!"  
  
He stepped forward with the Zain sword, thinking he couldn't dodge it.  
The moment he took his stance, he understood that the beast was a
fraction of a second faster, but he stepped in to thrust his blade.  
He thought of his training, believed in it, and resolved that even if he
died, he would surely thrust the blade and gain a little time.  
  
In that accelerated instant, which he could not perceive, the Suiko's
body seemed to waver in mid-air.  
The tip of his blade, having overcome that insufficient instant,
embedded itself in the flesh.  
He noticed he had struck its shoulder, not its throat, and without time
to click his tongue, he let go of his beloved sword, kicked its body,
and rolled away to escape.  
  
In his line of sight, the rampaging Suiko.  
A sword was embedded in its shoulder, and a spear was sticking out of
its flank.  
The moment he realized it was a Kre'Sharana spear, not one of his
guards', a large man with a powerful physique roared and lunged at the
Suiko.  
He pulled the spear from the still-thrashing Suiko's belly and thrust it
in repeatedly.  
Then, with an exceptionally deep thrust, he drew a large curved sword
from his waist, swung it down from above on the convulsing Suiko's neck,
and bit into the flesh.  
  
He approached, breathing heavily, a terrifying presence even more fierce
than the magical beast.  
  
"Ugh... Dukaran-dono..."  
  
Dukaran looked at him, his brow furrowed, and said,  
  
"Shut up. Lie on your back."  
  
He rolled over as instructed, and Dukaran ripped open the seams of his
leather armor with a small knife.  
Then, ripping his clothes similarly, he lightly touched his chest as if
to check.  
Argoshe groaned in pain but endured it, and after a short while, Dukaran
took his hand away.  
  
"It's not bad. You won't die. But, don't move for a while. ...Hey, take
him to the women and have someone treat him."  
"Y-yes, understood. Marquis, your shoulder."  
"Dukaran, Giterns-sama is...!?"  
"He seems fine, Lira-sama. His bones are probably cracked, but thanks to
the leather armor, it's not severe. He won't die if he doesn't thrash
around anymore."  
  
With a flutter of wings, Lira appeared, and she sighed in relief.  
Then she leaped off the griffon and rushed towards Argoshe.  
  
"They seem to have finished off the other one too. The warriors are
returning. Giterns-sama, please rest quietly for a while."  
"Yes, cough..."  
  
He coughed, almost crouching in pain from his chest, and Cax supported
him while Lira stroked his back.  
Seeing blood mixed with his saliva, Lira cried out, "Giterns-sama!" and
then gave a wry smile, shaking her head.  
  
"Just a cut inside my mouth... that's the blood. Don't worry."  
"...Truly, thank you very much, Giterns-sama."  
"...No."  
  
Another person, replacing Lira, also offered Argoshe a shoulder. Leaning
on them, he said,  
  
"I merely fulfilled my obligation. ...However, the situation is still
precarious. I leave the rest to you, Dukaran-dono."  
"...No need to tell me. Wounded men are in the way, go."  
"...Dukaran."  
  
Argoshe smiled wryly and then left the clearing. 
<br /><br />

  
Perhaps the excitement of the battle had dulled the pain.  
For about three days after that, even light movement caused intense
pain.  
There were many warriors with similar injuries, and they were all laid
out together in the assembly hall used by the women and received
treatment.  
  
Fortunately, there was no shortage of people to talk to.  
The women who applied ointment for bruises, gave painkillers, and
treated him expressed their sincere gratitude and talked about various
things happening outside, and his subordinates, when they had free time,
came to check on him and talked about the fields and such.  
He spent time talking with the other injured warriors who were resting
their bodies, exchanging stories about how they got hurt, and peacefully
passing the time.  
  
It was in his nature not to sit still, but thanks to them, who seemed to
feel the same way, he was fortunate not to feel rushed.   
Fortunately, it seemed no one had died this time.  
The man who had been thrown, whom he had seen from the watchtower, was
also there.  
Like Argoshe, in addition to chest contusions, his neck was also
immobilized, his right arm was broken, and his left leg seemed to be
sprained.  
  
Their beds were conveniently next to each other.  
Seeing that, he didn't have room to worry about himself, but the man was
still young and ended up being quite interesting.  
Upon hearing that Argoshe had a wife and child, he even started asking
for relationship advice on how to win a woman's affection, which made
the other men laugh.  
One of the women treating him seemed to be the object of his affection,
and his rigid posture while she treated him was enough to make even
Argoshe chuckle.  
  
He remembered how much trouble he had had with his somewhat oblivious
wife, presumably because he was so in love.  
He fell in love with her immediately when she visited as a servant,
kind, gentle, and unadorned, but it took him five years for her to
notice his feelings.  
In his wife's mind, they had naturally grown closer and become aware of
each other during their time together, but she probably still didn't
understand how much effort Argoshe had put into making her realize his
feelings.  
  
Remembering his wife made him think of Anne too.  
Anne had inherited her mother's disposition, which could be seen as both
a virtue and a flaw, but she had also inherited Argoshe's bad traits,
which she didn't need, and he was still worried about her future.  
He was happy that she was spending her time happily by the Queen's side,
but as a father, he also worried about what lay ahead.  
And so, he spent his days, talking about his family.  
  
He was allowed to go out after about a week.  
Vinthril and the others seemed to have returned around that time, and
perhaps having heard the story, they expressed their deep gratitude to
Argoshe.  
  
In times of emergency, warriors apparently generally didn't pay
visits.  
Lira had visited frequently, but not a single warrior came, remaining
faithful to their duty.  
However, when he did go out, many men, from young to old, greeted
Argoshe with smiles and clapped him on the shoulder.   
Even those who had previously looked at Argoshe with suspicion now
seemed to have reevaluated him.  
  
The fact that he nearly died and was injured felt insignificant when he
considered how he had been accepted by them.  
Even the pain felt like something to be proud of, but he didn't voice
it.  
It seemed that in other settlements, there were naturally places where
people had died.  
For them, that was everyday life.  
  
Even in Alberan, a soldier who faces a Suiko is praised for their great
courage.  
It is common for the general himself to reward a hero for simply
thrusting a spear.  
If one actually defeats it, the Queen herself would bestow a reward, and
that alone could grant a noble title like Rinea.  
But among them, that was the bare minimum.  
The courage to face a Suiko was something they were expected to
possess.  
Remembering the courage he had to summon despite his fear, he still
couldn't boast to them.  
  
Argoshe, too, accepted it as a matter of course and returned to his
routine as if nothing had happened.  
In the mornings, he lightly swung his sword and visited the fields to
gaze at the harvest.  
He harvested the well-grown water-drinking potatoes and told Lira he
really wanted everyone in the settlement to eat them.   
He was then informed that they would hold a feast to celebrate the
mountain calming down and their safe passage.  
And so, Argoshe also joined the feast.  
  
The men competed in spear and bow skills, and only at this time did the
women lightly adorn themselves and dance.  
They drank sake, ate meat, and enjoyed the feast.  
Compared to festivals held in the cities of Alberan, it was rather
modest.  
It was no different from those held in various villages.  
  
But seeing them laughing and enjoying themselves from the bottom of his
heart, Argoshe thought it was no less enjoyable than a city festival.  
He watched the injured man he knew from the incident spending time with
the woman he admired, stiff with nerves, and chuckled wryly when,  
  
"Hey!"  
  
A voice called from behind him.  
He turned around to see a giant of a man.  
He was wearing the fur of a Suiko, probably the one from the other
day.  
  
"Dukaran-dono. I'm gracing the lowest seat."  
  
His subordinates sitting beside him looked a bit tense.  
Seeing Argoshe nod and shift slightly, they also moved their seats a
little.  
Since then, Argoshe had barely spoken to Dukaran.  
Even when he thanked him, Dukaran would walk away saying he had no right
to be thanked, never approaching or speaking to Argoshe again.  
  
He was inwardly relieved that Dukaran had gone to the trouble of coming,
and poured the wine he had brought into the empty cup.  
It was the only gift that had been accepted—the same wine was being
drunk at various tables.  
  
Dukaran sat there silently and drained the offered wine cup.  
Then, he spoke.  
  
"The lowlands' alcohol doesn't taste bad either."  
"How about some potatoes as a snack?"  
"Already ate them. Not bad, but not particularly delicious either."  
"They're potatoes that root and grow easily in harsh lands, so that's
their advantage. These, at least, were prepared for snacks."  
  
Thinly sliced water-drinking potatoes, lightly fried in oil.  
If you covered it with salt and oil, it wasn't bad as a snack.  
Dukaran took one and, while eating, picked up the wine bottle.  
Argoshe bowed slightly and accepted the wine in his cup.  
  
Dukaran then poured wine into his own cup and glared at Argoshe, who was
offering his cup to make a toast.  
Then, he briefly raised his cup as if to make a toast, and then took a
sip.  
Argoshe smiled wryly and did the same.  
  
"I haven't acknowledged you. Your skill as a warrior is third-rate; it's
a wonder you could speak so pompously with that. You escaped death by
one in a hundred chances; pray your thanks to Rashelna-sama."  
  
Rashelna was the goddess of hunters, traditionally revered in
Kre'Sharana.  
It was one of the faiths separate from the Holy Spirit, continuing from
the lowlands.  
In Alberan, there was a similar deity named Raiselna. They likely shared
the same origin.  
  
"Yes. If not for Dukaran-dono's spear, the Suiko would have been a
fraction of a second faster."  
"Notice it before you step in. You can't even see your surroundings. If
you had just remained calm, you would have seen me holding the spear."  
"...I apologize."  
"Third-raters mistake recklessness for courage. Don't get full of
yourself just because others praise you for doing well. Even a baby
standing on two feet is praised for it."  
  
Despite the harsh words, he felt genuinely pleased.  
After all, he was calling him a third-rate "warrior."  
  
"Leather armor is useless against a Suiko. If you're going to wear
anything, use this."  
  
And from behind, he threw him a steel breastplate.  
It was thick and heavy, without a single scratch, still new.  
He opened his eyes wide in surprise as Dukaran drained his cup again and
stood up.  
He then took off the Suiko fur and placed it on the ground, turning his
back.  
  
"Your farm work is done, and your wounds have probably healed. From
tomorrow, instead of a hoe, bring your sword and show your face to me.
I'll teach you a real sword, not just a decorative one."  
"Yes. This is—"  
"I just wore it out of custom. And I just dealt the finishing blow. You
got the first spear. Do what you want with it."  
  
And with a single word, he walked away.  
Argoshe watched him, stunned, and then picked up the Suiko fur.  
It was heavy, and the fur was like wire.  
It was said to be strong against blows and cuts, and many warriors liked
to wear it.  
It seemed that many in Kre'Sharana wore lighter furs, perhaps because it
was too heavy, but it was still a valuable item.  
In Alberan, it was also very expensive, but it was worth more than
that.  
  
He watched Dukaran's retreating back, smiled wryly, and bowed his head,
folding it carefully.  
  
"Marquis..."  
"We have a new family heirloom. ...From tomorrow, I'll go to
Dukaran-dono's place."  
"...Yes, sir."  
  
Then, placing it next to the breastplate, he quietly smiled.  
  
"...It seems he's going to teach me the sword of a true warrior."  
  
Just like the nobles he had once envisioned.  
He savored the feeling of fulfilling his obligation.
