------------------------------------------------------------------------

Krische's mornings begin with Bery.  
  
In the early morning, sensing a shift in the flow of Bery's magical
power, Krische's consciousness surfaced from deep sleep.  
With hazy thoughts, she registered Bery's awakening.  
She vaguely thought that morning had come, but with eyes still closed,
she remained still for a while.  
Her eyelids wouldn't open.  
  
Bery's morning routine varied subtly each day. Sometimes she would
gently brush Krische's hair, softly caress her cheek, playfully nudge
her, tickle her nose, or lightly brush her lips—Krische had observed 57
distinct patterns, including minor variations.  
Furthermore, combinations of these patterns were common.  
Savoring Bery's affection and deciphering her mood was a quiet morning
pleasure for Krische.  
  
However, this morning's Bery kissed Krische's forehead and immediately
left the bed.  
For Krische, this was a somewhat disappointing amount of affection.  
Feeling slightly dissatisfied, Krische, now a lady (unlike her childhood
self), began to analyze the situation.  
  
Why had Bery abruptly cut short their precious morning intimacy?  
Krische's internal senses—considering last night's meal and her current
level of hunger—allowed her sharp mind to quickly calculate the time.  
It was slightly later than Bery's usual waking time.  
In other words, today's Bery was a "sleepyhead Bery."  
  
Of course, even though she was sleepy, it was still before sunrise.  
It was only slightly late, but Bery, Krische's eternal role model of an
unparalleled lady, was a strict and dedicated servant.   
To make up for this slight oversleeping, she would compensate in various
ways throughout the day, ensuring that the mansion's clocks remained
accurate, completing all her tasks—erasing the oversleeping as if it
never happened.  
  
"Everyone makes mistakes; what matters is what you do afterward" (from
Bery's sayings). Even if Bery overslept a little and their morning
affection was slightly less, it was understandable.  
In such cases, Krische, as Bery's capable deputy head servant, was
required to perfectly compensate for the head servant's minor
oversleeping.  
  
Krische mentally mapped out Bery's upcoming tasks and the time-saving
routes she would likely take to compensate for her sleep-in, drawing her
lips into a pout to fully awaken herself.  
With heavy eyelids, Krische slowly sat up.  
Stretching naked, she playfully pulled Kreschenta's cheek, who was
sleeping soundly as always.  
  
"Ugh, leave me alone," her younger sister whined sleepily.  
Krische let go, concluding that Kreschenta wasn't going to wake up
anytime soon.  
Pulling Kreschenta's cheek had about a 1/1035 chance of her waking up
and helping Bery and Krische with their work—the other 1034/1035 times
this was the result.  
As an older sister, Krische felt Kreschenta needed better discipline,
but being too strict contradicted Bery's educational approach.  
Sometimes Krische wondered if she was spoiling Kreschenta too much, but
Bery, not Krische, was responsible for the mansion's education.  
She tried not to voice these concerns.  
  
"Always consider the bigger picture" (from Bery's sayings).  
Because Kreschenta was lazy, Krische got to spend the morning alone with
Bery, assisting her with work.  
If Kreschenta had become a diligent servant, she would have been a
formidable rival, competing for Bery's limited time.  
Considering this, her sister's laziness wasn't necessarily a bad
thing.  
Being a responsible sister while Kreschenta was irresponsible was a
positive thing―at least according to Bery.  
  
Leaving the bed, Krische approached Bery, who had already changed into
her apron dress.  
  
"Good morning, Krische-sama"  
"Ehehe, good morning..."  
  
Krische stretched slightly, and Bery gave her a light good-morning kiss
on the lips.  
Then Bery started to prepare Krische's underwear and apron dress.  
  
The timing was crucial.  
If Krische had gotten out of bed before Bery finished dressing, it
wouldn't have been good.  
Dressing oneself is something one can do alone—waiting for Bery to
finish dressing to have her help you get dressed was clearly childish
behavior.  
It wasn't something a lady should do and could end up rushing Bery.  
  
Krische was a servant, assisting Bery.  
While Krische wanted Bery to help her get dressed, she couldn't be
overly dependent; it had to be natural. Krische would wake up slightly
later, and get dressed after Bery, having Bery help her dress—that was
the story Krische needed.  
  
Of course, Krische couldn't keep the busy Bery waiting.  
It was a matter of impeccable timing—not too early, not too late.  
Today, pulling Kreschenta's cheek was a part of the process. With that,
Krische could naturally ask for help getting dressed at the perfect
time.  
  
She put on her underwear and apron dress.  
  
"Fufu, is the apron tight?"  
"Just right!"  
  
The moment the apron strings tightened around her waist was her
favorite.  
In that moment, she felt like she was the same as Bery, a fellow
servant.  
She looked at her reflection in the mirror, feeling a profound sense of
satisfaction.  
Matching Bery's apron dress, she took Bery's arm.  
  
"Let's go light the hallway lanterns"  
"Yes!"  
  
This was the start of Krische's day and her duties as a servant. 
<br /><br />

  
Making things as they should be.  
When asked what a servant is, Krische had been taught many things.  
However, the simplest yet deepest-meaning instruction she'd been given
was that.  
  
For example, when someone wakes up in the morning and goes to the
hallway, it's naturally better if the hallway is bright.  
Therefore, the hallway lights must be on; that's how it should be.  
That’s why Bery wakes up earlier than anyone else and infuses the
perpetual magical lamps with magic.  
  
Bery said that’s all it is, but she applies the same logic to
everything.  
Cooking, laundry, cleaning—these are obvious, but even if Kreschenta was
in a bad mood, Bery would prepare a Lacra pie.  
Before Krische even mentions wanting tea, Bery starts preparing it.  
By the time Krische feels sleepy, Bery’s work is finished.  
  
The amount of cookies—never too much, never too little.  
Even when Selene and others joined unexpectedly, there's never a
shortage, nor any excess.  
It's as if Bery could see into the future, shaping things as they should
be.  
  
Using all her abilities, Krische could make predictions to a certain
degree, but those were still just possibilities.  
Preparing for every possibility leads to a lot of waste. However, Bery’s
intellect incorporated the psychological factors of others into these
countless possibilities, achieving an accuracy that was almost
precognition, predicting the mansion's future.  
It was an advanced prediction skill Krische couldn't replicate.  
  
"You're putting in a little extra today," Krische observed while
watching Bery pour magic into the perpetual lamp.  
Bery smiled.  
  
"The ojou-sama will probably stay up late tonight. She went to bed early
yesterday, but seems to be struggling with her pottery. She'll likely
spend the day in the workshop. I should prepare a quick lunch for
her."  
  
Bery always sends the minimum necessary magic to the perpetual lamps
first thing in the morning.  
This saves time from having to go and turn off the lights at night.  
Krische had thought that today's amount was more than usual, but that
was the reason.  
  
She refined information, read minds, and effortlessly derived results.  
The day's events at the mansion were probably already mapped out in
Bery’s mind, and the day would unfold exactly as she envisioned.  
Almost everything that happened in the mansion was under Bery’s
control.  
  
Naturally, she knew everyone's schedule.  
Moreover, she anticipated their daily moods and psychologies, seamlessly
providing comfort. Only then could one be considered a skilled
servant.  
Even Bery, a top-tier servant in Krische's eyes, considered herself a
work in progress.  
Compared to the depth of her profession, past battles were mere child's
play.  
  
Of course, compared to the battlefield where the results directly
affected life and death, the responsibilities of a servant were light.  
Of course, Krische understood why combat work was valued more than
mansion work, but there was no question which was more important.  
Bery, the pioneer of this field, was unparalleled; the greatest in the
world.  
From the moment she put on her apron dress to the moment she took it off
and went to bed—every moment spent with Bery was a learning experience
for Krische.  
  
Arm in arm with Bery, they took turns infusing the perpetual lamps with
magic, and then headed to the kitchen.  
  
The job of a servant was truly arduous. While simply completing tasks
was one thing, striving for high quality was endless.  
Waking up early, starting work, and forcing oneself to work despite
drowsiness was far from easy, greatly depleting one's energy.  
Krische’s body quickly reached a state of starvation—her stomach was
extremely empty, to the point where she could barely stand.  
While lighting the perpetual lamps, Krische had already reached her
physical limits.  
  
Krische realized her shortcomings in these moments.  
To avoid further physical exertion, an overwhelming desire to be
pampered surged within her.  
  
It was a strong desire that the still half-baked Krische couldn't
suppress.  
Although Bery's oversleeping led to less morning affection, complaining
about it would be unreasonable, deviating from the ideal lady and image
of a servant that Krische strived to achieve.  
  
But the unconscious mind is terrifying.  
As she snuggled into Bery's arms, Krische instinctively leaned her
weight on Bery, pulling her closer.  
Bery turned around and chuckled wryly.  
  
"My, you're acting spoiled today."  
  
"Eh... um..."  
  
Bery scooped her up, eyes twinkling as she looked at Krische.  
  
"Fufu, was the morning petting not enough?"  
"Uu..."  
  
Bery was a top-tier servant.  
She knew everything about the foolish Krische. 
<br /><br />

―And so, Krische was carried to the kitchen.  
Inside, Bery's magical water cats were busy.  
The cats were working together; warming up leftover stew, making
scrambled eggs, grilling sausages, and baking bread.  
  
When her hands were occupied, Bery used the cats.  
It would be more efficient to directly manipulate things with magic, but
Bery seemed to enjoy using the cats better; and always said that a
playful heart is important—this was probably another example of that.  
  
Seated on Bery's lap, Krische watched dozens of cats prepare breakfast.
A few cats brought over a set of tea.  
They presented Krische with a cup of tea filled with plenty of honey and
milk—Krische's favorite sweet tea.  
Taking a sip, she brought the cup to Bery's lips, and Bery took a small
sip.  
  
"Sweet things are good in the morning"  
"Ehehe…Yes. It's very delicious!"  
"That's the best. What shall we have for breakfast?"  
  
―Krische felt a slight tension run through her.  
  
Instead of “Shall we have X?”, it was “What shall we have?”.  
It was a declaration that she was letting Krische decide the breakfast
menu.  
  
Among the duties of a servant, cooking was most important—especially
breakfast, the first meal of the day.  
"Whether the day goes well or not depends on breakfast" (from Bery's
sayings).  
Mistakes were unacceptable.  
Bery was always careful to provide a delicious breakfast, avoiding new
culinary experiments. If breakfast was disappointing, no matter how
delicious lunch and dinner were, it would be a failure.  
  
However, choosing something too safe was also a mistake.  
Bery had surely considered that before asking Krische.  
A servant who safely chose a fail-proof option wasn't top-tier.  
Suggesting something delicious and appetizing—something that would truly
satisfy Bery—was necessary.  
  
"A Lacra pie should be one of the main dishes for Kreschenta…So a salty
dish would be a good complement."   
"I agree."  
"That means meat… but meat and Lacra pie for breakfast is a bit heavy.
We should have fish―"  
  
―No, just grilling it would be too safe.  
Krische choked back the words she was about to say and her eyes darted
around.  
  
"Fish?"  
"H-how about herb-roasted fish... with shellfish and tomato in a light
soup? Selene caught a lot of fish recently, and we still have a good
amount, about three types."  
"Ah, that's a good idea. Seafood is light."  
"Yes!"  
  
Bery stroked Krische's head, making her smile.  
Lightly browned fish, a bit of water, shellfish, and tomato.  
The original recipe used seawater, making it a light, salt-based soup.  
The type of fish, added ingredients, and final seasoning all
significantly impact the taste.  
  
However, this simple, delicate soup couldn't be easily covered up; the
slightest mistake was unforgivable.  
It was the Kreschenta of the soup world. Even the slightest misstep
could ruin it.  
Having suggested it, Krische needed to be more careful than usual.  
Pampering during cooking should be kept to a minimum—satisfying that
craving beforehand was essential.  
  
"Bery, a kiss…"  
"…Krische-sama, you’re really acting spoiled today."  
"Ehehe…"  
  
Bery stroked Krische's cheek, kissed her, and Krische hugged her
tightly, her lips still carrying the faint scent of the tea she had just
drunk.  
  
Bery usually smelled faintly of honey. 
<br /><br />

  
After pre-breakfast, they prepared and ate breakfast together.  
Then they began the washing and cleaning.  
  
In the past, they did multiple tasks concurrently, but with four
servants now, Bery prioritized enjoyment and leisure over efficiency.  
Quality over speed.  
No rush, no hurry, organized and thorough.  
  
Anne would handle this task today, Elvena would handle that one.  
When should they check on Lira? When will Kreschenta wake up? How is
Selene's work progress?  
  
Considering such things was what being a servant was all about.  
While wiping the stairs clean, Bery seemed lost in thought.  
Her mind always seemed to be on someone else, and her absent-minded
expression was strangely beautiful.  
  
Even after all these years, Krische still didn't understand her
thoroughly.  
She seemed to think of grand things while simultaneously thinking about
completely unrelated matters. The only thing Krische knew for certain
was that her thoughts revolved around others.  
She seemed to be in control but readily relinquished control, letting
things flow naturally.  
She often used vague terms like "somewhat," "approximately," or
"generally."  
Yet, in the end, everything always fell into place, and it was always
the best outcome.  
It was mysterious, often surpassing Krische's comprehension.  
That was Bery.  
  
There was an inscrutable god in the village of Karka.  
The number of deer and wild boar, the abundance of fruits and
vegetables, the yield of the mountain—these were all in the god's
domain.  
Whether rain continued, sunshine persisted, or a storm arrived, these
were all acts of God.  
It wasn't that the god was inscrutable, but rather that the divine was
inscrutable.  
That's just how things were; people accepted it, offering prayers
without fully understanding.  
  
Krische accepted it as another rule, another thing that couldn’t be
known.  
The concept of faith was foreign to Krische.  
It didn't matter whether she believed or not; as long as she went
through the motions of prayer, it was enough.  
Krische only came to a vague understanding of the concept later.  
  
Bery, in the past, had been like a god to Krische.  
Krische's world was the mansion that Bery created, and that was
everything.  
Bery fulfilled Krische’s expectations, and everything Bery said seemed
right. The world changed according to her will.  
Krische felt that Bery knew everything, and there was no reason to doubt
her.  
  
But Bery always talked about "what she wanted to be," not "what she
should do."  
  
She remembered Bery's words vividly.  
Whenever Krische felt lost, she saw Bery's face and recalled her
words.  
Krische rarely understood the meaning of Bery's words instantly.  
She mostly came to a slightly clearer understanding years or even
decades later, as the words seeped into her mind.  
Probably Bery knew that, and that’s why she always talked to Krische
that way.  
Because that was the best way.  
  
As Krische’s worldview expanded, especially after Bery's departure,
Bery’s words became more personal, and her image became clearer.  
  
Bery never changed.  
She only helped Krische find the Krische she desired.  
She patiently accompanied the silly Krische, never complaining, always
laughing.  
She always worked hard for Krische.  
  
"Ehehe, I've finished polishing the ornaments"  
  
Bery hugged her and gently stroked her head.  
  
Cleaning, laundry, tidying up.  
The daily tasks were the same yet different every day.  
The first principle of Bery’s teachings was always, to think.  
  
"This place is also clean now… It's about time Kreschenta-sama wakes
up."  
  
Surely she was also doing the same, pondering things and putting her
finger to her lips.  
Bery wasn't the god Krische once believed in, and she thought about many
things.  
From small things to big things, she worked hard for others every day.  
  
Bery was probably an extraordinary, peculiar person.  
No one else in the world would be quite like her.  
That's probably why she appeared beautiful to Krische.  
  
Assisting Bery, who always had others on her mind.  
A servant for someone Bery didn't need to worry about.  
  
The Krische that Krische desired, was that kind of Krische.  
  
"Krische-sama, please go check on the Ojou-sama."  
  
Today, Bery would deal with Kreschenta, who was acting childish and
spoiled.  
Even if she wanted to check on Selene's pottery, Bery couldn't be in two
places at once.  
  
Therefore, Krische’s job was to help Bery.  
  
"Fufu, then I'll leave the Ojou-sama to you.  
  
Berry smiled and gave her a kiss.  
  
Krische's afternoon began just like that.
