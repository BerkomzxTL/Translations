## Chapter 312: Reine – The End

*From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I have admired you,
Reine-sama.*  
To the lovingly whispered words, Reine replied with a bored
expression.  
  
“….Finally, I understand. You’re broken, aren’t you?”  
“If I am broken, would you accept me? If so, it’s convenient for me to
answer that I am broken.”  
  
Fili chuckled happily, shaking her shoulders and laughing like a girl.  
  
“But is such a distinction necessary? Everyone could be said to be
broken, and everyone could be said to be normal. We are all imperfect
beings, Reine-sama. Naturally, that includes you.”  
  
Then she pointed to her own head.  
  
“Perfection is something that desires nothing and wishes for nothing.
Even if Reine-sama is exceptionally beautiful, you are ultimately just
another imperfect animal like the rest of us. Eating, sleeping, mating;
you are no different from a dog or a cat… just another human…”  
  
When Reine frowned, Fili smiled.  
  
“…Scoffing at this meaningless world, insisting on being different,
believing you are special to avoid fear; you are merely using the word
‘special’ as self-justification for your sense of alienation. Seeking
meaning in childbirth; you do nothing different from any other human…”  
“…Do you want me to kill you?”  
“Absolutely not. It’s just a little bit of guidance in my role as your
educator, in place of Venure.”  
  
Casually sipping her tea, she narrowed her eyes.  
Maintaining her composed demeanor, devoid of fear or apprehension.  
Just an irritating woman.  
  
“Ultimately, it’s a pack of beasts. Each person acts as they please,
seeking their own advantage. Money, the opposite sex, power… everyone
does as they please. You are the same; by loving Elsreine, you are
merely using her to gain love in return. Even pure goodwill exists only
because of the reward of self-satisfaction. Consciously or
unconsciously, it varies from person to person…”  
  
Fili continued mockingly.  
  
“This world is like that. If you think it’s meaningless, you should die.
There is no such thing as a human who can love others without any reward
in return… You must understand that, yet you continue to live… isn’t it
because you expect someone to give you a reason to live in this
meaningless world?”  
“…”  
“But the world won’t always accommodate you. What needs to change is
you, Reine-sama. Just by opening those closed eyes, you will find
countless people who seek your love, desire to love you, and give you a
reason to live.”  
  
—Naturally, that includes me.  
  
Reaching out, she touched her cheek and traced her skin lovingly.  
  
“Won’t you accept my love first? I assure you, you won’t regret it. So
that Reine-sama will never have to close her eyes again… I will fulfill
all your desires.”  
  
Letting go of her hand, she covered her mouth and let out a chuckle.  
After finishing her tea, she stood up.  
  
“It’s late, so I’ll take my leave, Your Majesty… Please give it some
thought. Tomorrow morning, I’ll be here for cleaning and tidying—…?”  
  
She forcefully pulled Reine’s hand, throwing her onto the bed.  
Without resistance, Reine collapsed.  
Fili pressed down on her hands, staring blankly at Reine.  
  
“…You can make that face too.”  
“Well… I am human, after all.”  
  
Saying so, she shifted her gaze, her cheeks flushed, and took a deep,
sighing breath.  
Relaxing her tense body, she smiled sheepishly.  
  
“Is this… your way of accepting my earlier words?”  
“Not really… I just wanted to see what kind of meaningless love you
would offer.”  
“Fufu, as expected of Her Majesty. By sharing a physical intimacy, you
can discern whether the other person’s love is true. What an amazing
skill—…!”  
  
Kissing her, Fili inserted her tongue, licking and exploring.  
Reine stiffened for a moment, her eyes wide open, yet she offered no
resistance.  
  
“…Be quiet.”  
  
Upon hearing this, she fell silent as instructed, nodding, her eyes
wavering.  
  
Most people of the world were little more than tools.  
Different from Reine and others—she merely used them out of whim.  
Without any particular meaning, she neither accepted the unpleasant
woman’s words, nor changed her mind, nor fell in love.  
  
It was just a whim.  
The irritating woman’s giggling, mocking, condescending gaze was
becoming tiresome, and she just wanted to relieve some irritation,
that’s all.  
She was curious about what lay beneath that irritating mask.  
  
“…Ultimately, everything in this world is an illusion, no different from
a dream, Reine-sama.”  
  
Even after it was over, with their naked bodies pressed together, she
continued her sermon-like rambling.  
  
“Those of us with uncertain hearts express and receive them in various
ways. We huddle together, touch each other, and weave words, making them
seem certain, even though our hearts can never be fully conveyed or
read. Each person interprets things in their own way, seeing the reality
that suits them…”  
  
The words were grating to the ears.  
  
“If we can't understand, isn’t it far more rational to interpret things
in a way that makes us happy? At least, I, who don’t want to sadden
Elsreine-sama, would never kill or harm you. Therefore, it would be best
to conveniently interpret that you are being loved by me.”  
“It’s just convenient for you, isn’t it?”  
“Of course. Fufu, I am only interested in my own happiness.”  
  
Chuckling, shaking her shoulders, and narrowing her eyes.  
As if expressing affection, she peered into Reine’s eyes.  
  
“What I want is the convenient reality of being loved by both of you,
Reine-sama. To be invited to Elsren, where both of you live happily, and
to spend happy days together… After all, as long as you can't kill me,
resisting is pointless.”  
  
“I’m persistent,” she laughed happily, taking Reine’s arm and leaning
against her cheek.  
  
“Even if you refuse, I will stay by your side, whisper love, interpret
all your words and actions in a convenient way, and devote my life to
you… No matter how much you doubt me, I will tell you that I love you
endlessly.”  
  
“I shouldn’t have picked up Venure,” Reine said, and Fili laughed.  
  
“That’s what we call regret; because it’s irreversible,” she said,
rubbing her cheek against Reine’s.  
  
“…May I stay here and sleep next to you until morning?”  
“I’ll sleep alone. Get out.”  
“I merely asked. I simply want to sleep next to you.”  
  
Chuckling softly.  
Laughing, she snuggled closer and kissed her.  
  
“Fufu, until the other Reine-sama returns from the battlefield… I will
visit your room every night from tomorrow onwards. And every night, I
will tell you rambling tales and sleep next to you.”  
  
Then, as if speaking of a happy future, she used Reine’s arm as a
pillow.  
  
“…When she returns, if we sleep together, she will surely be overjoyed…
Fufu, she’s a very happy… such a wonderful person.”  
  
—Good night, Reine-sama.  
  
Having said what she wanted to say, she closed her eyes. Reine let out a
sigh, releasing her irritation.  
  
She was an unpleasant woman, but surely, that’s how it would be.  
Looking at her sleeping face, she had a strong feeling that that was how
it would turn out.  
  
However, it was only a feeling.  
That future did not come to pass.  
  
“…”  
  
Was it the effect of the drug?  
As she tossed and turned alone on the bed, sleepiness slowly crept in.  
The drug she used when she killed her father—a drug that allowed one to
die in their sleep.  
  
With a hazy mind, she wondered why she was born.  
Did the various things she had done to survive have any meaning?  
  
Or was it because she had made a mistake that she was in this
situation?  
  
—Good, very good. This child’s name is Reine.  
Let’s name her Reine.  
  
Later, she came to understand the meaning of the words, something that
shines brightly.  
The servants said it was a beautiful and wonderful name. She was desired
and loved; that’s how Reine was born.  
  
Is that so?  
She wondered, and she convinced herself that it was so.  
She was desired, loved, and that’s why she was here.  
If she was given love, it was natural to return it.  
What is love?  
She searched various books, but she couldn’t find the answer, and she
tried her best to return it, even for her mother who died early, all for
her father’s benefit.  
  
Did it not get across? Or was it not love?  
  
“I’m truly sorry, Reine. I love you… truly, I love you. Forgive your
foolish father, who used you for his own selfish desires…”  
  
Were those final words love?  
She whispered that she loved him, and he responded that he loved her.  
She was indeed Reine to her father.  
He repeated the same words over and over again, like a mutterings until
the very end.  
  
It didn’t matter anymore.  
It was over, and there were no answers.  
Since it was over, it didn’t matter.  
  
“If we can’t understand, isn’t it far more rational to interpret things
in a way that makes us happy?”  
  
By doubting everything and using people, she was finally allowed to
live.  
But did that life have meaning?  
Perhaps it was rational.  
If there is no happiness, only suffering, then there is no meaning in
living.  
  
“That’s not true. It wasn’t foolish at all… What Her Highness sought was
not such a calculating thing, but the undeniable love from the late
King.”  
  
In the end, she wanted that.  
From birth, she lived to obtain it, gave up on the idea that it was
different—and then, she picked up Fili, and Reine was born.  
  
“…Scoffing at this meaningless world, insisting on being different,
believing you are special to avoid fear; you are merely using the word
‘special’ as self-justification for your sense of alienation. Seeking
meaning in childbirth; you do nothing different from any other human…”  
  
When she recalled Fili’s face, she still found it hateful and
irritating.  
The woman who lectured her so haughtily died soon after, losing her own
purpose in life.  
None of her wishes were fulfilled.  
  
—This is still a meaningless world, Fili.  
  
Or was it her own fault for not being able to convince herself that it
was fulfilled?  
  
If she had accepted it earlier, would there have been a different
future?  
Feeling like there might have been, she lowered her gaze, curling up
like a baby.  
  
—“Mother!”  
  
Like her daughter, Reine could not accept it easily. Everyone,
everything was unbelievable, doubtful, fearful, distant, and survival
only came through manipulation.  
  
“What are you doing! Call a doctor!! Mother, please calm down… open your
mouth, Mother—”  
  
Actually, she knew, but she was just scared.  
She grabbed the arm shaking her body, stopping the movement.  
While hugging her, she quietly closed her eyes.  
  
If she could have become like that child, would she have had a happy
present?  
As if shutting out her blurry vision, she curled her body in an
embrace.  
  
—As if entrusting her body and mind to the dark, gentle darkness. 
<br /><br />

  
Elsren was ruled by the Three Dukes.  
Reine made a ceremonial appearance at the parliament, but she neither
spoke nor uttered a word.  
Only when occasionally asked for her opinion by Golzarias and the
others, she would perform calculations and write them down on paper.  
Only such abilities were required; no opinions were sought.  
  
Nevertheless, she had more opportunities to learn about the nation's
finances than before, and she continued to write proposals for
improvement on paper and hand them to Golzarias.  
About half were ignored, and the other half were approved in
parliament.  
At least it was better than doing nothing—if it improved the lives of
the people, even a little, she would continue to make proposals.  
  
All the proposals were submitted to the parliament as proposals from the
Three Dukes and accepted.  
She understood that she was being used for their achievements, but even
that didn't matter.  
  
This wouldn't last forever, and they would eventually die.  
If she endured for another ten, twenty, or perhaps a few more years,
people different from them might eventually emerge.  
She hoped to build a good country with those people.  
For that reason, she only considered preventing the country from
collapsing further.  
  
Security was deteriorating, and small-scale rebellions were breaking out
in various places.  
She heard that some churches had been burned down and that children from
an orphanage had been killed.  
They weren't large-scale incidents, just minor disturbances.  
  
The people were being told that it was the work of Alberan, but she
didn't think so.  
If her mother was serious, the country would have collapsed even
further.  
However, when she repeatedly heard it, she sometimes vaguely wondered if
it might be true.  
Reine betrayed her mother, and skirmishes were repeated near the
border.  
Her mother was much smarter than Reine.  
She might be doing things that Reine couldn't understand.  
  
Reine didn't understand anything.  
She didn't understand the country, nor anyone else.  
What was the intention behind these words?  
What was the intention behind these actions?  
Reine was confused about everything.  
She was anxious about how her words and actions would be perceived.  
  
Even writing was a little scary.  
  
“Elsreine-sama, it’s done!”  
  
When she saw the children at the orphanage, she felt a little more at
ease.  
She smiled at the girl who showed her the drawing and stroked her
head.  
  
After seeing them for decades, she could understand even the pictures
she didn't understand before.  
The picture depicts the orphanage, the orphans, and Reine.  
Everyone had a smile on their face, standing happily side-by-side.  
  
From subtle features, she identified this child and that child.  
When she pointed to them with her finger, the girl laughed happily, and
seeing that, Reine became happy too.  
  
“I wanted to draw like Elsreine-sama’s pictures…”  
  
When she stroked her head, she giggled, and the other children, seeing
this, came to show her their pictures.  
Whenever she came, this place hadn't changed.  
The director here was a boy who had originally been an orphan, and now
he was doing a wonderful job, teaching various things to the children.  
They were all good children, and even though they sometimes fought, they
were close to each other, and every time she came, they happily welcomed
her.  
  
Surely, the country will become better someday.  
She could believe that if these children grew up, and every time she
felt down, she could regain her spirits here.  
  
“Someday, I want to be like Elsreine-sama—”  
“Elsreine-sama.”  
  
Looking in the direction of her name being called, she saw Fenela's
happy face.  
Tilting her head, Fenela smiled and said, “We have a guest.”  
  
A man appeared beside her.  
Unlike Fenela, who possessed magic, he looked quite old, but his
features still retained some resemblance to his younger self.  
  
“…”  
  
She was about to call out “Neil,” but no sound came out, and her eyes
darted around.  
Then, she smiled and approached him.  
He was a boy who had been at the orphanage around the same time as
Fenela.  
  
“…It’s been a long time, Elsreine-sama.”  
  
She nodded in response and bowed her head.  
When Neil looked puzzled, Fenela explained.  
  
“Well…because of various things, she’s lost her voice.”  
“…Her voice?”  
  
Neil furrowed his brow and shifted his gaze.  
She shook her head and smiled, wondering if he was worried.  
  
She heard that after leaving here, Neil had apprenticed with a
craftsman.  
However, his physique was that of a warrior, and his hands had the
stiffness characteristic of someone who wields a sword.  
She was curious, but she didn't mention it, and she went outside as he
suggested, saying, “Shall we go to the garden?”  
She walked with him, listening to Fenela and him talk.  
  
Fenela asks Neil what happened, and he replied that many things
happened.  
He then asks Fenela what happened to her, as she was putting on an apron
dress. Their conversation was short, ending as they reached the
garden.  
  
“This area will do”  
“This area…?”  
“Yes… I’m sorry, Fenela.”  
  
Neil suddenly whistled.  
He grabbed Fenela by the neck, revealing a hidden knife which he plunged
towards her throat.  
  
“Neil! What…?”  
“Elsreine-sama, please don’t move.”  
  
Neil spoke to a confused Reine.  
From a carriage at the entrance, the screams of soldiers rang out.  
Dozens of men appeared, scaling the orphanage walls and slaughtering the
soldiers to gain entry.  
  
“…Please die quietly.”  
  
Neil tightened his grip on Fenela’s neck, pressing the knife closer.  
The men laugh, praising Neil.  
Even Reine, who was in shock, understood the situation – these men were
Neil’s accomplices.  
  
“So this is Elsreine. Well, well… to come to such an unguarded place
with such weak protection… truly impressive. Playing the good person…
how amusing.”  
“Leaving rotten lords unchecked, using extorted money for your
charitable facade.”  
  
The men hurled insults at Reine, their eyes bloodshot.  
At least, that’s how it appeared.  
Reine was a hypocrite, perhaps.  
Reine had done nothing.  
  
Neil’s gaze flickered.  
  
“I know what kind of person you are. You have your reasons. However… the
current state of this country is far from the Elsren you once described
to me. …The ideal place you spoke of… will never be visited.”  
“N-Neil… Elsreine, please… don’t mind me…”  
“The wife I loved rejected the advances of a noble, and was killed. Even
if I kill that noble, the beastly nature of this country will remain.
…This country can no longer be entrusted to you. You must die.”  
  
Don’t resist, Neil said.  
  
“If you obey, Fenela will never be… harmed. Prepare yourself.”  
  
Reine unconsciously distanced herself from the approaching men.  
Escape would be easy. But seeing Fenela held hostage, Reine looked at
Neil.  
  
*‘Someday, when I… grow up, I want to go to war, to fight for
Elsreine…’*  
  
—I want to help create the country Elsreine wishes for.  
Reine was stunned, remembering Neil’s words from the past. She lowered
her eyes, kneeling.  
  
“Kol, take her. As promised, you don't touch her. …I will.”  
“Hey, don’t joke around. Just killing her isn’t enough. We’ll make her
regret being born, make her suffer before killing her.”  
“That’s right. Tie her up and take her away. Holding her hostage will
stop them from interfering.”  
“You’re an idiot! I didn’t do this for that—… !?”  
“E-Elsreine-sama!”  
  
Arguments erupted, punctuated by a shout of Reine’s name.  
Fenela, escaping Neil’s grasp, roughly pulled Reine to her feet.  
  
“You!”  
“Stop!!”  
  
Then she pushed Reine away.  
Reine couldn't scream; a sword swung down on a smiling Fenela.  
  
Crimson blood splattered around. 
<br /><br />

  
—Alone in a room, Reine sat before a white canvas.  
  
Reine’s memories, indelible, were fragmented.  
She slaughtered dozens, methodically, coldly, then stared blankly at
Fenela’s lifeless body.  
  
Soldiers gathered, took her away, along with Fenela, to the castle.  
The image of Fenela burning at her funeral… after that, her memory was
patchy.  
She woke, slept, felt hunger but didn't care.  
She remembered Golzarias visiting, but not what was said.  
  
Reine sat before the canvas, still untouched.  
Was she trying to paint something?  
Unable to comprehend her own actions, she recalled Fenela’s face.  
  
*‘Fufufu, a truly wonderful painting. Elsreine’s painting… I really like
it.’*  
  
Remembering those words, she mixed colors.  
  
“…”  
  
While mixing, she imagined Fili’s face.  
  
Fili taught Reine that the important thing is the message conveyed.  
What does Reine want to convey?  
What kind of painting is she trying to create?  
  
She didn't know.  
She didn't even know why she was picking up a brush.  
  
*‘Fili, do you understand what you’re painting before you paint?’*  
*‘Well… fufufu, I often just paint whatever comes to mind.’*  
*‘Whatever comes to mind…’*  
*‘Yes. I just draw lines randomly, then shape what vaguely comes to
mind… while thinking about what kind of picture I want to see myself,
you know.’*  
  
She envisioned the thousands of paradises she had painted – the shining,
small paradises.  
The Elsren Fili described.  
  
The adults had vanished from the Elsren where various people once
lived.  
Fili seemed to imagine what a person was thinking when she painted
them.  
Reine tried the same.  
This person wants bread, and their neighbor gives it to them.  
This person is being offered tea, and the other person says thank you.  
She painted this way, but gradually, she couldn't figure out what they
were thinking anymore, and she eventually stopped painting.  
  
Only children remain in paradise, but… she remembered children looking
at her through the window, fearfully.  
What were they thinking? Were they afraid of Reine?  
  
*‘…This country can no longer be entrusted to you. You must die.’*  
  
—I want to help create the country Elsreine-sama wishes for.  
  
Looking back, she realized she didn't really understand what they were
thinking.  
She only thought she understood; it might have been different.  
Either way, they too will grow up and become incomprehensible.  
  
She tried to paint something, but the Elsren in her head was devoid of
people, and the shining paradise felt desolate, tainted by something
dark.  
A dark substance, a mixture of various colors, seemed to be swirling and
erasing the bright world.  
  
The Elsren she painted until recently was now so distant, it was almost
invisible.  
The dark color swirled and pushed the paradise further and further
away.  
  
Suddenly, she stopped and stares at the canvas.  
The white canvas was being darkly painted from the edges. She stares at
it blankly before glancing at other unfinished canvases.  
  
The small shining paradise—Fenela always rejoiced at seeing them, as if
seeing them for the first time.  
Lately, she had been painting them with purpose, and she moved to finish
one, she stopped as she approachesdit.  
  
How should she finish it?  
As she tried to visualize it, something dark pushed the image from her
mind.  
A dark shadow fell, and she imagined a paradise with no one in it… a
rising nausea caused her to cover her mouth.  
  
“Ugh… uh…”  
  
She vomited for a while, then looked up.  
All the unfinished canvases looked the same.  
  
The dark shadow, like it was filling it in from the edge… she stared
blankly.  
Her head spun, and she threw the dark-colored brush away.  
  
No matter where she looked, every painting was being filled with dark
colors.  
Even the paintings in her memory all made  her feel sick.  
  
“…li…”  
  
She called out the name, but she wasn't there.  
She was nowhere. She had been gone a long time.  
For decades.  
  
No one remained in Reine's Elsren.  
There was no shining scenery, only dark colors.  
Her vision blurred, and her chest spasmed violently.  
  
She learned so much, but Reine could do nothing.  
She became a puppet of others, inflicting suffering on the people.  
The country was distorted, her paintings were distorted. She wondered
what Fili would say if she saw her.  
She could no longer imagine an Elsren like hers.  
  
—She just wanted to convey it.  
That Fili was there, which is why this place was created.  
That was all, there were no other wishes.  
  
She already knew that she wouldn't see Fili again.  
So she just wanted to create something that she would be proud of.  
She just wanted to imagine Fili praising her, and be filled with that
happy imagination.  
  
But Fili would surely not praise her like this.  
She couldn't even imagine that.  
After decades, she couldn't do anything right, she couldn't even paint
the kind of paintings Fili would praise, she couldn't even imagine
Fili's smile.  
  
—In a way, that place was my Elsren.  
  
She wanted to go back to that time.  
To the time when Fili was always by Reine's side.  
  
Why did this happen?  
The question repeated endlessly in her mind.  
She wished she had died on the day Fili died.  
  
A fruit knife caught her eye.  
Half-unconsciously, she picked it up, staring at the sharp blade.  
  
Will she really never meet her again?  
She imagined the incomprehensible stories of heaven taught in the
church.  
If such a place exists, would Fili be there?  
But only good people are called there.  
Even if such a place exists, Reine probably wouldn't be able to go.  
  
“…”  
  
She looked around, at the dark-colored paintings.  
Each one was dull and lifeless, sickly.  
  
Either way, even here, she won't meet her again.  
She realized that she couldn't even imagine her anymore. She trembled as
she pressed the blade to her throat.  
  
Her neck was slit open and she collaped, observing the crimson blood
spread from her body.  
  
If only she'd been wiser, like her mother.  
If only she’d been wiser, like Fili.  
Then things might have been different.  
  
Her regrets swirled, and she slowly closed her eyes.  
To escape from her endless thoughts.  
  
—Casting her body and her soul into the dark, murky abyss. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
—Elsreine, the first emperor of the Elsren Holy Empire, died of
illness.  
A few days later, Grabareine, the strong queen of Alberan, both a
benevolent ruler and a tyrant, also died.  
  
Her eldest son, Seir, told his subjects that the era of terror was
over.  
He rallied his anxious subjects, and five years later, abdicated the
throne to his nephew.  
He spent the rest of his life not as king, but as an advisor.  
  
Seir didn’t speak much about Grabareine’s death, neither confirming nor
denying the various rumors.  
Some said he usurped the throne; others that he protected whoever killed
the queen; others that he covered up the queen’s suicide—various rumors
circulated among the people.  
Grabareine had many enemies.  
It was said among the people that she was executed by someone kind.  
  
Many who knew of Grabareine’s reign of terror gave a certain degree of
credit to her immense achievements, but spoke of the ultimately chaotic
and fragmented kingdom, cautioning against repeating the same tragedy.  
A secret agreement was made to eliminate the “children who don’t cry,” a
presence known since ancient times in the royal family, treating them as
cursed children.  
  
The most famous of these “children who don’t cry” were King Bazalyshe,
Queen Grabareine, and Princess Elsreine.  
  
—And it is said that the great queen who unified the continent and
etched her name in history, and her sister, were also such “children who
don’t cry.”  
  
“…Is that so? That means there probably won't be a war for a while.”  
“Everyone feared Grabareine because of Elsreine’s death… yet Duke
Lucazaan remained calm. Did he know this would happen?”  
“No, I just had a feeling. …Get out.”  
“Y-yes…”  
  
Ignoring the man leaving the room, Golzarias sat on a large sofa, gazing
at the paintings above the fireplace.  
They were all paradises she painted.  
Smiling faces depicted.  
The meticulous detail and superb—no, uncanny—technique.  
Each one was a masterpiece of art that would be unparalleled for
centuries to come.  
  
While sipping strong liquor, Golzarias savored it.  
He looked at the paintings. He didn't have much interest in the
superficial aspects.  
Just another well-made painting, no matter how high-quality.  
That’s all it was to him.  
  
The ultimate beauty for which many wealthy people pay exorbitant sums.  
That kind of thing was meaningless to him.  
  
He merely pictured the painter, wondering what wishes she poured into
her paintings—that's all he contemplated, savoring it.  
He didn't look at the dazzling technique that captivated many; he
earnestly looked at and tried to understand what the painting intended
to convey.  
  
His gaze moved across each one in turn.  
Finally, he fixed his gaze on the painting in the center above the
fireplace.  
  
Unlike the other paintings, it lacked any trace of beautiful technique,
resembling a doodle.  
Various dark pigments mingled, haphazardly covering the white canvas
from the edges.  
The last painting she made.  
Officially, it’s apparently titled “Light in the Dark Night.”  
  
The light in the darkness, from adults to children, and finally to the
end.  
The Pope proclaimed it to be a symbol of reincarnation.  
It was laughably foolish, but it didn't matter.  
Most things were meaningless to Golzarias.  
This painting was not significant.  
  
The last work of a girl who painted so many magnificent paradises, a
work born from desperation.  
No technique, just raw emotion.  
Seeing it, he felt a tremor deep within his soul for the first time.  
  
Recalling the process that led this girl, who, though broken, was able
to love people so purely, to this point.  
Just looking at it brought back decades of memories.  
He recalled a childlike, trusting voice: Lucazaan.  
  
“…”  
  
He noticed something on his cheek, wiped it away, and looked down.  
The back of his hand was wet; "Ah," he realized.  
  
“…Elsreine-sama”  
  
He brought his right fist to his left chest—a gesture of devotion.  
  
That strange emotion may be the most absurd and ridiculous emotion.  
At least, the tightness and pain in his chest must be that.  
  
He has a wife and children.  
He has experienced everything human, yet he has never loved anyone.  
He is a broken monster—possessing nothing but money, power, and
pleasure.  
  
But he somehow believes that this is what he is feeling now.  
  
“…You were my Reine.”  
  
What he obtained after decades was agonizing and suffocating.  
Yet it inexplicably gave Golzarias a sense of life.  
  
Reine, so distant, forever out of reach.  
  
*“…Elsren is nice.”*  
*“Elsren…”*  
*“That… name, from just now.”*  
  
Her gentle, modest voice, along with the scene, came to mind.  
Pure, the most beautiful person in the world, the only one.  
  
“…I love you, Elsreine-sama.”  
  
—May you be able to journey to Elsren in the next life.  
  
With a heartfelt prayer, Golzarias bowed his head. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

Child who doesn't cry. Cursed child.  
Such words repeated endlessly.  
She didn't understand their meaning; she only received them as sounds.  
  
Her chest hurt; she just emerged from a dark place.  
  
—The world was dazzling to her blurry vision. 
<br /><br />
