## Chapter 322: The Threat Lurking in the Depths

*AN: This is a diversionary future what-if. It's pretty rough, so if you
don't like the worldview being destroyed (*  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The story that this earth was a large, round sphere.  
  
—Just what kind of world is this?  
The various theories were brought to an end by Queen Grabareine of
Alberan. Astrology, which uses the movement of stars to predict the
future—in the Alberan region of the past, the positions and movements of
stars were believed to indicate good or bad omens, influencing various
aspects of this world.  
Therefore, at that time, such astrology was considered an important
factor in political decision-making, and she silenced it by
theoretically demonstrating, through calculations of orbits and physical
laws, that this world was one star floating in a vast space—the
universe.  
  
A vast world and stars connected by gravity and centrifugal force.  
No one could refute Grabareine, who had clarified the mystery as
physics. The mystery of astrology was lost, while her theory continues
to be used as the foundation of astronomy today.  
  
Grabareine probably wasn't interested in space.  
She only clarified it because it was necessary. Although she created a
perfect foundation, she didn't continue further, and astronomical
research was treated more like a hobby for amateurs.  
Bery thought so too, and didn't have a strong interest in conducting
such research. However, looking at the outline of the universe drawn on
parchment on her desk, her heart still fluttered.  
  
"I see…it's an unbelievably vast size."  
  
In the room, there were Selene and Bery sitting on the sofa, and Krische
and Kreschenta sitting on top of them.  
It was the usual sight; including Elvena, who stood by, with their gazes
directed at the desk.  
  
"That's because your intellect is inferior."  
"…Yes, you're right—"  
"Honestly, you can't even do simple calculations properly; it's
infuriating. Must I teach you from basic arithmetic? I went to the
trouble of explaining it to you, and your conclusion is that it's
unbelievably vast? That's incredibly stupid—"  
"…Woof."  
"W-what was that…?"  
  
Bery, keeping a smile on her face, stuffed a cookie into Kreschenta's
mouth to silence her.  
  
"Mmmph…"  
"Woof, that's it, Kreschenta-sama."  
  
Then, she ruffled her hair as if she were a dog, deepening her smile.  
Ignoring Selene's exasperation, Bery lowered her gaze to the
parchment.  
Countless beautiful circles were drawn, which would not be thought
possible with a freehand drawing; it conceptually depicted the world
from around this star and beyond. Large celestial bodies and small
celestial bodies, countless celestial bodies drawing spirals, floating
in the endless void.  
Noticing Elvena also peering at the parchment, she asked her.  
  
"Do you like it too, Elvena-sama?"  
"Yes, it's very interesting. I don't know anything about astronomy…"  
  
Elvena also answered with curiosity in her eyes.  
  
"Fufu, I'm not that knowledgeable either…but it's fun to imagine various
things. With so many stars, I wonder if there are aliens?"  
"…Aliens?"  
"Yes, just as we were born by chance, other people might have been born
by chance…considering the number of stars and years, it doesn't seem
impossible."  
"I see, yes. Insects and fish, lizards and snakes…there might even be
intelligent plants."  
  
As they chuckled together and Bery fed Kreschenta cookies, Krische, who
had been drowsily leaning against Selene, spoke up.  
  
"Does Bery want to see aliens?"  
"Yes…well, more like I find it fun to imagine."  
  
"Okay… Ehehe, it would be nice if there were aliens—"  
  
It would be nice if there were aliens—the voice of a small creature on a
small planet. A sound that would normally disappear in an instant in the
boundless void.  
  
In that conversation, the small creature realized there was a hole in
its own 'security,' rewriting the network etched into the root world and
expanding that network. The Fuyopita Net—later called the Ether Limit, a
world law that closes the path to the root and sets a limit on magical
inscription. It restricts the rapidly advancing power of magic, causing
and suppressing magical disturbances in large-scale descriptions that
exceed a certain range.  
It was a 'rule' engraved in the deepest part of the world to prevent the
collapse of the world due to powerful magic.  
  
And so, the voice of the girl who communicated with the root
unintentionally became part of the network.  
—I hope my beloved servant enjoys it.  
Such an unconscious wish echoed from the root to the unbelievably vast
world of stars.  
  
It would be nice if there were aliens—  
  
From the root to the root.  
Along with the expanding network, it distorted spacetime, and the voice
propagated through the void world. From star to star, as if to fill the
endless void one by one.  
  
It would be nice if there were aliens—  
  
A journey to the root that transcends spacetime. The network filled the
discrepancy in distance with time, simply going farther. While riding
the spacetime ripples as if going back in time through the universe, it
advanced through the void before life proliferated on their star, simply
following the assigned process.  
  
—It would be nice if there were aliens—It would be nice if there were
aliens—It would be nice if there were aliens—It would be nice if there
were aliens—It would be nice if there were aliens—It would be nice if
there were aliens—It would be nice if there were aliens—It would be nice
if there were aliens  
—From the distorting root of spacetime, the voice reached the incredibly
distant past.  
  
"Kararararara"  
  
The planet Minaldoria, later called the seventh planet of the Minalshi
system. The lizard-like creatures inhabiting it felt something like a
wave piercing their bodies for a moment and raised their heads.  
  
"Kararararararara?"  
"Kara"  
  
While communicating through cries, they quickly forgot about the wave.  
However, something decisively different was engraved deep within them. 
<br /><br />

  
—Adjusting and irradiating negative mass generative tachyon particles.  
Reflecting the enemy's precise current position by filling in the
temporal discrepancies, a wormhole was immediately formed and
infiltrated.  
Simultaneously with the warp-out, a torrent of energy that could turn a
star into a dead planet in a matter of days was released from the
fleet.  
The vast energy supplied from the collapse furnace produced
instantaneous destruction and light through a giant particle
accelerator, sweeping away and annihilating the enemy.  
  
A hit-and-run warp. In battles set in the vast universe, such tactics
were the main focus. Warp out to the front of the enemy, who is
light-years away, perform a barrage of fire while jet-propelling. After
breaking through to the rear of the enemy, form a wormhole again and
warp to gain distance.  
  
Energy shield, wormhole formation, close-range defense fire.  
In the huge bridge with a crew of five hundred, all of this was handled
collectively, and countless voices conveying various reports flew back
and forth. The ones shouting were reptilian-like creatures.  
Lizard-like faces, with two magnificent horns on their temples. They had
no scales but grayish skin with a dull luster, and their bodies were
tightly covered from head to tail by a purple suit with a rubber-like
texture.  
Apart from the silver metal protectors on their chests, groins, feet and
gauntlets, they were relatively simple. They moved their four
rubber-covered fingers, freely manipulating the floating holographic
display.  
  
The engineering-form fleet was passing through a dangerous space
creature species, a group of cosmic amoebas.  
Hideous monsters that digest and multiply organic matter—a swarm of
Arnias.  
Even one slipping through could easily flatten a star.  
Perhaps they learned some wisdom in the long war despite their low
intelligence; they were becoming similar in shape to the fleet. They
freely merge and separate, and if they grow huge, they far exceed the
combat ships in the fleet that accommodate ten thousand personnel. Using
an unknown method, they form particle accelerator cannons inside, and
once they break through the ship's shield and attach themselves to a
vessel, they could easily break through the nano-coated high-density
armor and infiltrate the ship, multiplying.  
  
Not a single one could be allowed to approach.  
Most of those deployed in front were incinerated with the main cannon at
the head of the ship, and while scattering secondary cannons to maintain
the breakthrough point horizontally and vertically, the fleet passed
through the center.  
  
"98.7% of the Arnias have been destroyed! 18,375 individuals remain!"  
"Good, cease warp-out and switch to extermination. All ships turn,
launch Fortresses."  
  
Shouting from the unusually large chair in the center was Millgangga,
the commander of the 237th Expeditionary Fleet. His forehead horns were
adorned with gold and jewels, and he wore cloth instead of a suit. The
inside of the coat draped over his body from both shoulders emitted a
faintly warm light.  
—It was a heater to warm the body.  
  
The Minalshi, who call themselves the rulers of the galaxy, were
primates with strong bodies and rich intellect—but they had the weakness
of being extremely sensitive to temperature changes.  
  
They fall into a state of hibernation when they get cold.  
  
Therefore, their suits were designed to keep their body temperature
constant at all times, but this was only a minimum level of insulation,
far from comfortable.  
They were extremely averse to cold, but due to their species'
characteristics, when they're warm, they fall into a state of mental
relaxation—in short, they become indolent.  
  
Overcoming such racial characteristics, keeping their body warmly
heated, and yet maintaining a firm attitude as a commander, Millgangga's
appearance should be called that of a great hero. Everyone directed
their respectful gaze toward his courage.  
  
The fleet turned—  
Along with the instructions, numerous carrier-based aircraft took off
for the extermination of the remaining enemies.  
The latest model, the Fortress, a brainwave link-direct type aircraft,
scattered particle accelerator cannons from both arms, destroying the
remaining small Arnias with erratic maneuvers that ignore inertia.  
Since it was an aircraft for planetary conquest, its three legs (two
feet and a tail) were dead weight, but due to the brainwave link device,
its movement was not bad.  
The Arnias' bewildered appearance was clearly visible from the
surroundings.  
  
"I thought it was just a toy, but it's not bad. Technology officer,
bring me the combat data later."  
"Yes!"  
"However…"  
  
Millgangga turned his face sideways.  
There was a small Minalshi—its gray skin was balding in several places,
indicating that its lifespan was nearing its end.  
  
"That was dangerous. I didn't expect them to have spread this far. If
the permission had been delayed, even the jewels you speak of might have
been consumed."  
"Yes, exactly as you say… But what wonderful leadership, a victory
without any casualties. Such a large swarm… If it weren't for
Millgangga-sama's fleet, what would have become of us?"  
"If you're surprised by this, you'd have your tail cut off just by
seeing the Hive Conquest battle. In the old Kudas conquest battle, there
were ten thousand times more—"  
  
'Data reconciliation; 135,347 times.'  
  
"The details are details. Well, that's about how many Arnias there
were."  
  
Chuckling at the AI, Millgangga continued.  
  
"I don't even want to imagine. The Hive that completely swallowed a
planet… In that conquest battle, my grandchildren and
great-grandchildren—ten people—devoted themselves to the Minalshi."  
"Many died. In that battle, it would be easier to find those who didn't
lose family members. Including those who lived in Kudas."  
  
Millgangga closed his eyes as he reached out to touch his right horn.
The elderly Minalshi, Gilyurya, also closed his eyes.  
For them, this was a prayer.  
  
"After the extermination is complete, conduct an ultra-long-range search
again. If there are no problems, warp-hole entry will be in thirty-two
Minalshi standard hours. Gilyurya, take a break and compile the data
from Venua. I want to confirm it one more time before arrival."  
"Yes. Understood, Millgangga-sama."  
  
Residential areas and artificial celestial body residential areas that
completely cover the star.  
The Supergalactic Minalshi Empire had established many celestial
structures outside the planet and flourished.  
But no matter how far they go, it's all artificial.  
Many Minalshi had a longing for a real land—a habitable natural
planet.  
  
Adjusting the orbital and rotational speeds by colliding ice celestial
bodies, including ice meteorites.  
Moving the stars to a survival zone, giving them abundant water,
planting trees—terraforming was being carried out on many planets
sequentially.  
However, even with the technological level to completely remake a star
system, it takes a long time to turn a single planet into a habitable
one.  
Currently, 90% of the population was living in artificial residential
areas—most of them die without ever setting foot on real land.  
  
It was certain that there were many undiscovered habitable planets in
the universe, but the universe was an immense world.  
Even if they had a means of transportation far exceeding the speed of
light, no matter how many exploration ships they sent, they were an
extremely insignificant existence. Even if their number reached several
hundred billion, it was merely a tiny speck of dust in the universe.  
Natural habitable planets were not easy to find.  
  
"Millgangga-sama. Warp-out complete near planet Venua, coordinates
specified, space stabilization complete. No abnormalities in any
ships."  
  
"….Hmm. I want to see it directly. Release the shielding."  
"Yes!"  
  
The front shielding, which had been closed for warp navigation.  
The bridge's protective wall opened to the sides, revealing a small,
jewel-like celestial body. Seeing it, Millgangga widened his eyes and
wagged his tail back and forth.  
  
"This…is Venua. How beautiful…"  
  
It was one of the celestial bodies that had been confirmed a short time
ago.  
Abundant water resources.  
Covered in green, and beneath it, there were suspected to be many
mineral resources—the jewel of the universe, planet Venua.  
Like Millgangga, many people saw it and wagged their tails. They don't
have expressions, but their emotions show up in their tails.  
Many were overwhelmed by the beauty of planet Venua and were
overjoyed.  
  
—The Minalshi took to space and obtained the technology to travel the
world of stars a long time ago.  
At times, they fought wars with similar space civilizations, consuming
entire rich star systems for a mere single star.  
However, once they looked outwards, they understood in the depths of
their hearts that the universe was vast.  
In the face of such a beautiful planet, it seemed almost comical how
small a world they had been fighting in. The universe was truly
overflowing with countless stars.  
  
A blue ether blanketed Venua, adding shades of color to the planet's
green.  
Despite having encountered many astonishing opponents, when viewing the
ultimate beauty of this celestial body, there was still an awe of the
divine felt in the horns.  
He remembered something that should be called a god, something that had
been lost due to scientific technology, and closed his eyes, touching
his right horn.  
  
"…What you actually see is different from the data."  
"Yes, indeed. That I was able to bring Millgangga-sama to this planet in
my lifetime is the greatest honor… The pride of my life."  
  
The small lizard standing beside him—Gilyurya—trembled his tail and his
eyes were wet.  
  
"Gilyurya. I'll tell His Majesty about your work. …A golden horn is sure
to be granted."  
"Yes. Thank you for your kind words."  
  
The Minalshi are all ruled by the Supergalactic King Minalshea.  
Basically, only royals like Millgangga, or those who have been
recognized for great achievements, are allowed to have decorations on
their horns. The golden horn was inferior to the jeweled horn of someone
like Millgangga, but it was the greatest honor for commoners—it was
given to those whose contributions were to be recorded in Minalshi
history.  
  
But this planet Venua was worthy of it.  
Abundant water resources, a stable climate, and the gravitational ratio
was almost the same as their home planet, Minaldoria. The oxygen
concentration was also very close.  
There were only a few examples in history where Minalshi could land on a
planet without needing terraforming, even with protective suits.  
  
Gilyurya was a well-known exploration technologist.  
Knowing his achievements in the discovery of this planet Venua, no one
would oppose giving him the honor of a golden horn.  
  
"As planned, we'll deploy the advance party tomorrow. Gilyurya, this is
the planet you found. You'll be on the first ship."  
"……Is that alright?"  
"Yes. It's inhabited by a pre-spacefaring civilization. There shouldn't
be any danger… but don't go wandering around too much."  
"Y-yes!"  
  
Gilyurya closed his eyes as if overcome with emotion, wagging his tail.
Millgangga laughed as he watched him.  
  
Planet Venua was home to a variety of creatures, but among them, a
bipedal intelligent species called the Venua people had been identified.
They were organic lifeforms and a type of warm-blooded animal. They
reproduced sexually, giving birth to live young.  
—To the Minalshi, they were a closely related species. Considering the
silicon-based lifeforms, gas-based lifeforms, celestial-scale cosmic
beings, and amoebas that travel through space independently—lifeforms
that defy common sense—such beings evoked a sense of kinship.  
  
Drone-based ecological surveys were largely complete. Their vision was
based on light. They possessed hearing and smell, and their sensory
organs were largely similar to the Minalshi's.  
They were capable of relatively advanced conversation through
vocalizations. While they couldn't sense heat like the Minalshi,
surprisingly, a significant portion of them could perceive and
manipulate psychokinetic particles—ether.  
The reason for their technological stagnation, despite their relatively
advanced society, was likely this.  
  
Ether, while seemingly useful, had low scalability due to the existence
of an ether limit—instability during large-scale use—and it wasn't
conducive to technological advancement capable of, say, traversing the
galaxy. While its daily use was certainly convenient, it was speculated
that this convenience had hindered the development of other scientific
technologies among them.  
  
And a low technological level limits the world.  
Currently, there was no unified government, and multiple nations were
engaged in territorial disputes. It was reminiscent of the time when the
Minalshi were still crawling around their home planet.  
High-rise buildings stood tall, low-level projectile weapons using ether
as a firing mechanism were used on battlefields, and spacefaring
technology was also primitive.  
Several debris-filled "toys" were observed in orbit, but it would be a
long time before they could colonize other planets.  
  
They likely believed this single planet was their entire world.  
Establishing a symbiotic relationship with them, who had yet to even
achieve planetary unification, would be difficult, but it was the
responsibility of the pioneers of civilization, their predecessors.  
  
The fact that many intelligent lifeforms had been lifted up, protected,
and managed, was of course, due to the Minalshi's own interests and
economic reasons, but not only that.  
Space was full of dangerous lifeforms and species with whom
communication was impossible. Amoebas like the Arnia, while lacking
intelligence, move instinctively, consuming organic matter and
repeatedly dividing—a single fragment of such a being could easily
destroy a civilization like this and swallow it whole.  
Technological enlightenment was essential to deal with such problems.  
  
And the universe still held many problems that even the Minalshi
couldn't solve. If these beings, who could perceive and manipulate
psychokinetic particles through sensation, reached the same level as
themselves and forge a cooperative relationship, it may be possible to
find a solution to several existing cosmic-scale problems. The richness
of the stars, the species that inhabit them; they must be placed under
their protection before other hands could reach them.  
  
Besides strange lifeforms, there were countless barbarians in the
universe who plot the subjugation of other species, even closely related
ones.  
It was fortunate that they reached them before they fell into the hands
of such beings.  
  
The next step was the means—currently, Venua didn't possess powerful
weapons capable of breaching the ships' shields.  
A simultaneous descent to the main areas of the planet, to intimidate
them, should be enough to bring them to the negotiating table.  
The use of force should be minimized as intimidation, and they planned
to avoid destroying their culture as much as possible.  
While contemplating the future, an alarm blared.  
  
"Wh-…!?"  
'High-density ether entity detected in the first bridge. I repeat, a
high-density ether entity detected in the first bridge—'  
  
Before long, a Venua person with long silver fur (on her head)—a small,
female intelligent lifeform—appeared before them.  
She was no bigger than Millgangga's thigh, a tiny one. Without any signs
of fear, she curiously put her right finger to her mouth and looked up
with purple eyes.  
Then, she clapped her hands together and uttered something
unintelligible, something like, "Oh, space lizards," or so.  
  
How did she appear here?  
They were fully prepared for warp-based close combat.  
The internal defenses were strong, and it would require a similarly
sized ship or facility to pierce the spatial barrier utilizing energy
from the collapse reactor. However, no such facilities were detected in
this star system, and judging from the current technological level, it
would take several thousand cycles for them to even grasp a fraction of
that technology. Naturally, it would be impossible to conceal it.  
  
—The academic issues could wait.  
  
Immediately recovering from the confusion, Millgangga pointed his left
hand at the silver female in black and white clothing.  
A miniature particle accelerator gun instantly deployed, and he extended
his right hand to stop her.  
Simultaneously, he accessed the ship's network through his neural
implant device and activated the defense systems.  
  
"Stop!"  
  
The safety device of the portable particle accelerator was deactivated,
and the battery cartridge connected.  
Firing the trigger would unleash energy capable of easily obliterating a
single lifeform.  
He caught sight of defense drones deploying at the edge of his vision,
and finally breathed a sigh of relief, satisfied with the measures.  
  
The silver female turned her strangely purple eyes to the left and
right.  
Did she understand the situation even though she didn't understand the
words?  
  
"That's right, is that it—?"  
  
He stopped himself because he had forgotten to activate the translator.
The alarm was ringing.  
  
'Ether alarm. Cracking is in progress—cancelled. Welcome,
administrator.'  
  
One of the defense drones floated defenselessly towards the female, who
grabbed it.  
She patted the armed defense drone, examining it curiously, while
Millgangga looked around.  
A technician touched the three-dimensional console, and he saw that
access was being blocked—he realized a moment later that ship control
had been taken over.  
  
"You…!"  
  
It was now an instinctive reaction of fear.  
He pulled the trigger aimed at the female, releasing the particle
accelerator cannon.  
Excessive energy was instantly irradiated directly to the lifeform,  
  
"Wh-…!?"  
  
However, the beam did not incinerate the female.  
It vanished, as if swallowed by the void, before her eyes.  
The female looked at it without any signs of surprise, calmly
approached, and waved her hand.  
  
—In an instant, all the Minalshi on the bridge collapsed as if
crushed.  
It felt like every single cell in their bodies was being pressed against
the floor.  
  
"Ga—…!?"  
  
Millgangga was no exception; clinging to the floor, he barely managed to
turn his eyes to the female.  
She crouched down holding the drone, and looked down at Millgangga, her
mouth curving into a smile.  
  
'First meeting. Greetings. Space primitive Minalshi. Krische is a
servant named Krische.'  
  
An alarm blared, signaling strong ether interference.  
A strange sensation—only the meaning was transmitted directly into his
mind.  
  
'Planet. What purpose?'  
  
The innocently swaying psychokinetic particles.  
The overwhelming pressure was more terrifying than any enemy they had
ever encountered.  
It was an ancient, dreadful instinct for the Minalshi.  
  
'Doubt.'  
  
A multitude of crackling sounds echoed around them.  
Many of the Minalshi on the bridge had their tails severed, as instinct
commanded, and were bouncing on the bridge floor.  
Millgangga felt the pain in his tail's base—he severed his own tail,
suppressing the instinct to flee with willpower.  
  
The silver female uttered a mysterious sound, "Hoee," while watching,
tilting her head.  
Then, as if remembering something, she activated the translator.  
The data collected and analyzed by Gilyurya beforehand informed them
that "Hoee" meant "admiration" or a similar expression.  
  
'Greetings. Attack. No good.'  
  
The meaning was transmitted directly to his mind again, and the pressure
on Millgangga's body disappeared.  
As he got up, those around him were in similar positions—looking at her
in confusion.  
  
'…Who are you?'  
"Oh, you can talk in our language."  
'I'm using a translation device. …Answer my question; how did you
intrude?'  
"Um… if you ask how, Krische just bounced… hop, hop…"  
'Hop, hop: An onomatopoeia emphasizing the act of bouncing by repeating
"hop."'  
  
While looking at the translator's linguistic analysis, he simultaneously
analyzed the female in front of him.  
She looked no different from the intelligent lifeforms inhabiting Venua,
but a significant difference was observed: an unusually high density of
ether emanating from her.  
The ship's AI judged it to be a high-density ether entity—at least not a
simple organism.  
There seemed to be some subspecies among the Venua people, but such a
being had not been identified.  
  
Gilyurya, who had been lying on the ground, finally stood up and shook
his head.  
It seemed to be an unidentified species.  
The "hop, hop" was likely a unique type of warp.  
At least, it was one of the unknown methods of travel.  
  
"Anyway, Krisch will try again… Nice to meet you, space lizard.
Krische’s a servant named Krische. If you have no hostility, Krische
won't do anything bad, so don't worry."  
  
The female—Krische—tilted her head, asking what their business on this
planet was.  
He looked at Gilyurya, who nodded silently.  
It was better to answer honestly—that seemed to be a common view.  
It was possible for someone who manipulated ether to that extent to read
minds.  
  
She had suppressed this fleet flagship, equipped with the latest
technology, as easily as twisting a baby's tail.  
And terrifyingly, she was a servant.  
Literally—if the previous telepathy and Gilyurya's translation analysis
were correct, it meant that she had a master.  
What kind of being could surpass this transcendental ether lifeform?  
  
'I am Millgangga, the Supreme Commander of the Minalshi Expeditionary
Fleet, serving the Supergalactic King Minalshea. I apologize for the
previous rudeness. …We came here for the exchange and coexistence with
the intelligent lifeforms on this planet, leading to prosperity, and for
technological enlightenment. We are also considering colonization after
deepening our exchanges.'  
"Enlightenment, colonization…"  
'We intend to provide technology to intelligent lifeforms that are yet
unable to even migrate into space, to provide them with the strength to
confront the many unknown threats that lurk.'  
  
Fortunately, they did not show any hostility—or rather, they did not
even have the chance to harbor hostility.  
The opponent had instantly seized control of the state-of-the-art large
warship, casually withstanding a particle accelerator cannon, which was
strong enough to erase a shield deployed by the soldiers.  
While paying close attention to Krische, the terrifying unknown entity,
he continued.  
  
'To be honest, we considered the possibility of using some force during
the process of establishing a cooperative relationship. This fleet is
for intimidation… however, I swear on this horn, we have no intention of
conquering or destroying this planet.'  
"Hmm, Krische understands… that's what you mean. It was quite a large
energy, so Krische might have been a little hasty. Um…"  
  
As she put her finger to her lips, the ether alarm sounded again.  
What instantly appeared was an old-fashioned, huge double door.  
The Minalshi widened their eyes and exchanged glances—when the door
opened, another individual with long red fur (on her head) peeked out.  
Beyond, a forest of lush trees could be seen.  
  
"Ehehe, Bery, it's the space lizards."  
"Krische-sama, that's no good. The space people probably have business
with those people, and the Ojou-sama is furious saying to come back
soon… um, hello…?"  
  
The red-haired female also bowed her head, gazing at the countless tails
bouncing energetically the on deck and expressing her confusion.  
Then, she beckoned to Krische.  
  
"Yes. Somehow, the business seemed peaceful."  
"That's a relief. Let's go back, then."  
  
"Excuse us, then," said Bery or so, and she took Krische and closed the
door.  
The door vanished without a trace, and just like a passing storm, it was
over. Millgangga stared blankly at Gilyurya.  
  
"Gilyurya, that individual was…"  
"I don't know. She looked like a Venua person on the surface… but a
being composed of ether… perhaps. It was a sight that was hardly
believable…"  
  
The ship's AI had returned to its original state, but the Minalshi's
tails bouncing around them reminded them of the stark reality.  
  
"…No, I really can't believe it. She broke through the ship's protective
field and easily took over the state-of-the-art ship's AI…"  
"…Yes."  
"The former could still be understood as an unknown method of
ether-based travel, but the latter is not something that can be solved
with ether. The AI itself was not destroyed; it was instantly understood
and rewritten in its complex structure… even if that entity was the
arithmetic unit itself, it exceeded the physically possible calculation
speed."  
  
Gilyurya displayed the Venua people's data on the window.  
The average intelligence level was slightly lower than that of the
Minalshi.  
Due to the small amount of data, the difference between the high and low
seemed large, but even the highest was a realistic level as a biological
being. It would not reach the level to make the previous anomaly
possible.  
At the very least, that was an exceptional being even among the Venua
people.  
  
"Among those we have encountered so far, she was an unimaginable
existence… but the word 'hasty.' She probably came to investigate our
intentions. We possess enough warships to destroy this planet. She was
probably wary of that."  
"The other one also used the expression 'those people,' suggesting… that
beings like that, a different species from the Venua people, are lurking
on this planet."  
"That's a reasonable assumption. …On this planet, there exists a
god-like, transcendental being that has been forgotten."  
  
God—yes, that was the only way to make sense of it.  
At the very least, it was a higher-dimensional entity different from
themselves.  
  
"Shall we… retreat?"  
  
Gilyurya said in a voice that seemed to suppress something painful.  
An overwhelming abnormal existence against which our technology was
completely useless—the danger was too high, and abandoning interference
with this planet was one of the options.  
  
"No, we will continue."  
"But…"  
"If they had been hostile, we would have been killed at that point. They
just came to observe us… that was the atmosphere. Retreating here would
only increase our concerns… It's better for us to take the initiative
and deepen our exchanges with them to prevent radicals from visiting
here after hearing the story."  
  
Millgangga declared resolutely, looking at Gilyurya.  
  
"But we must exercise extreme caution. We will conduct a thorough
observation, and the descent and negotiations will be carried out
afterward. Gilyurya, I leave the command to you."  
"Yes!" 
<br /><br />

  
The embassy established for the Minalshi was quite spacious, tailored to
their size.  
The ceiling height and corridors were like those of a museum, and the
conference room was like a party hall.  
The reason for such a size becomes clear at a glance.  
  
'Well, the more I learn, the more fascinating this place is. The various
facilities and tools using ether… literally, you are a gathering of
magicians.'  
"Haha, we were once called that. The use of ether has advanced
considerably, but it wasn't as widespread in prehistoric times, and the
name you mentioned was frequently used, closer to what you said."  
  
Their height was twice that of an adult male—the Minalshi were very
large.  
When they first saw them, they overwhelmed by their presence, but after
fifty years of contact, they were no longer afraid.  
Commander Millgangga had a dignified attitude that was befitting a
soldier, but he had a gentle disposition.  
  
Fifty years ago, they appeared across the planet with their advanced,
interstellar warships.  
They gathered the leaders of each nation in one place and, using their
absolute power, forced them to sign a ceasefire agreement.  
Then, they dedicated thirty years to establishing a unified federal
government, followed by cultural exchange and technological
enlightenment.  
  
Before their arrival, there had been much debate about the existence of
extraterrestrials.  
But everyone agreed that these beings were as close to ideal aliens as
could be imagined.  
Despite cultural differences, they were remarkably sincere, and several
years ago, a designated residential zone for them was established on the
planet.  
  
"The cycle of peace and war, of growth and decline… In prehistory, there
seems to have been a calendar called the Unified Era. The question you
asked earlier was related to that,"  
'Oh…'  
"From my perspective, it's… like a myth. To be honest, I'm hesitant to
tell Millgangga-sama this…"  
'Don't worry. I'm very interested in this matter.'  
  
Indeed, it could be called be a myth.  
A legend from thousands of years ago.  
However, even among scholars today, one of the popular tall tales was
the story of the ancient Queen Kreschenta.  
The theory that she, a powerful etheric ability user, created the
remaining World Tree and the etheric rainbow that once enveloped the
planet, remained quite popular.  
They heard that even influential scientists who supported the natural
occurrence theory had switched sides.  
Though they didn't know the details. It seems people tend to give up
when faced with something they can't understand.  
  
The problem was that beings with advanced civilizations like the
Minalshians were showing interest in the story.  
  
—They wanted to speak to someone knowledgeable about powerful etheric
users, including those from the distant past.  
  
That's what they seriously asked the other day.  
Therefore, they had no choice but to call in etheric scholars who were
knowledgeable about history, a group that was more of a hobbyist
gathering.  
  
Wearing an old-fashioned apron dress, with silver and red hair.  
Their names were Krische and Bery.  
They checked several places after being told it was extremely important,
and the two rural scholars living near the World Tree reacted strongly.
They were less etheric scholars and more enthusiastic archaeologists.
They had their doubts about whether it was truly the right approach, but
at least they did what could, so couldn't be blamed.  
  
Entering a room with a large round table, There were two women, one with
black hair and the other with blonde hair. The two, sitting with their
backs to the door, stood up and bowed deeply.  
  
"Nice to meet you, Millgangga-sama. I am Aralize Quilos, and this is my
assistant, Milsee Gecia."  
  
The blonde woman, Aralize, announced it like a demure lady.  
They could tell that the black-haired Milsee was nervous as she followed
with a greeting.  
Their counterpart is a Minalshian royal—at least the de facto ruler of
this planet currently. It was understandable that they were nervous.  
The blonde woman looked at Millgangga with some curiosity, while the
black-haired woman seemed somewhat intimidated by his large stature.  
  
'Black-haired one, don't be afraid. I'm not going to eat you; I just
want to hear your story. I apologize for taking up your time today.
Please, let's begin.'  
"Y-yes…"  
  
Millgangga sat at the far end of the round table, and they sat next to
them. The blonde woman projected the documents she held in her right
hand using a projector.  
  
"First, I'd like to confirm the information you're seeking. Are you
simply interested in historical etheric ability users, or are you
interested in the individuals known as Krische and Bery?"  
'The latter. It seems you know something about them.'  
"Yes. At least, Krische is said to be a great etheric ability user who
left her name in prehistorical legends. The name Bery is also mentioned,
though sparsely, as her attendant…"  
  
Then she expressed some doubts.  
  
"Krische's name is quite famous… There are many accounts, and she even
appears in some games as the name of a general in the continent-unifying
nation of Orbelun. However, the name Orbrinar is more famous…"  
'Orbrinar?'  
"Heavenly Sword…or Divine Sword, meaning God's Soldier…"  
"Alberan and Alberinea."  
"Excuse me, the pronunciation varies depending on the old language…
Milsee's pronunciation seems closest to the correct one, but that's
essentially what it means. Even now, with many records lost, there are
many plays and research materials from that time, leaving no doubt that
she was an unparalleled general and a powerful etheric ability user."  
  
But, she continued.  
  
"However, those who know Bery are quite rare. Many documents only
mention her as a red-haired attendant, and only those very knowledgeable
about the period know her name as Bery."  
'…I see. That's what bothered me—why I know that name.'  
"So Milsee speculated that perhaps Millgangga-sama had met the two… that
was her deduction."  
"Both of them, isn't that impolite? Such a fantasy—"  
'Good, Galan. I see… those two were indeed the people I suspected.'  
  
Millgangga chuckled, a characteristic Minalshian laugh.  
  
"Y-you met them!? Alberinea!?"  
  
The nervous Milsee jumped up, placing her hands on the table.  
She immediately pressed her head and sat back down.  
  
"M-Mil…see."  
"Y-yes…"  
  
Millgangga nodded calmly.  
  
'As you deduced… At least, I have met them. It's unbelievable even now,
but… shortly after arriving here, my flagship was seized. By that
etheric entity named Krische.'  
"No way…"  
  
They stared at him, dumbfounded. Millgangga chuckled again and displayed
a window in the air.  
  
'Because of the nature of the footage, I've never shown it to the Venua
before… but it's alright for you two. This is visual and etheric
observation data.'  
  
The footage was from the massive ship's bridge. The Minalshians were in
an uproar at the sudden appearance of a silver-haired etheric entity.  
Its outline was blurry, emitting a strong light.  
The footage, a restoration and correction of distorted image data due to
unknown noise using various sensor records and the data from
Millgangga's and his crew's brains, didn't clearly show the etheric
entity's form.  
It easily deflected a powerful particle accelerator cannon, and the next
moment, the Minalshians were prostrate—their countless tails thrashing
wildly were clearly visible.  
  
'We were completely helpless against the powerful etheric interference.
Incredibly, the ship's AI was instantly cracked and hijacked. Even now,
it feels like a nightmare… but since this record exists, we can't just
dismiss it as a dream.'  
"That's Alberinea…"  
  
Milsee gasped, her eyes sparkling as she stared at the window.  
Aralize also looked surprised. Galan, too, was undoubtedly shocked by
the footage.  
Having witnessed many of the Minalshian's astonishing technological
feats since his days as a Minalshian liaison officer, Galan's
astonishment was immense.  
Their technology, which they referred to as magic, was beyond magic to
them.  
The fact that a single individual could seize their flagship was beyond
astounding.  
  
"…Orbu—excuse me, Alberinea's language is close to our unified language.
But it sounds quite archaic… perhaps it's a dialect derived from the
Mail language, considered the prototype of the unified language… no, the
Western Common Language. The language used in Alberan, the
continent-unifying nation at that time, was called that."  
'So it seems. We have been analyzing it since then, but there are some
differences between this language and the known languages.'  
  
A red-haired woman suddenly appeared through a large door and a
silver-haired girl ran towards her.  
Once they both entered, the door disappeared as if nothing had happened.
Only the countless thrashing tails remained, a very chaotic image.  
It was no wonder they hadn't shown it before.  
For the Minalshians, tails breaking off during intense fear was a
shameful trait, so showing it would have been unacceptable.  
  
'What do you think of the etheric use shown here… as scholars?'  
"It's beyond imagination. I myself have studied and learned to handle
etheric use more than the average person… but this is on a different
level entirely. Honestly, I don't understand it. At least, no ordinary
human could do the same."  
"I told you! It's definitely the queen and Alberinea who—"  
"Mil, I know you're excited, but calm down. Stay."  
  
Milsee, apparently getting excited, blushed and apologized.  
  
"Sorry, she specializes in prehistorical civilizations and Alberan…and
she believes that the World Tree and etheric rainbow are largely related
to the powerful etheric ability users of that time."  
'It's fine. That's what scholars are like.'  
  
Millgangga chuckled.  
  
'That's what I want to know too. I want to know what kind of being this
Krische is. The AI's analysis of the high-density etheric entity, that
extraordinary ability… I believe she is like a god.'  
  
"Y-yes… I think she was such a being. It is believed that about 8,000
years have passed since the establishment of the Unified Era—the Alberan
era—but there have been many legends about seeing a mysterious figure
wearing an apron dress."  
  
Milsee answered, blushing slightly.  
  
"There are similar urban legends even today, but it's difficult to
verify their truth. In fact, there is no record of it in any video
medium."  
'Venua technology wouldn't allow it. Even the footage we just saw was
distorted by noise. Without our technology and the data from the ship's
sensors, we couldn't have restored it.'  
  
At this, Milsee exchanged surprised glances with Aralize.  
Millgangga asked what was wrong, and Aralize replied.  
  
"There are a few such stories actually. There are stories about strange
visitors, but the surveillance camera footage showed uncertain noise,
and their image wasn't recorded… it's usually dismissed as just another
tall tale."  
"So, they were intentionally interfering with the image data, causing
noise?"  
"It's a possibility."  
  
Millgangga nodded.  
  
'Galan, thank you for bringing them here. They are pricisely the kind of
scholars I wanted to meet.'  
"Yes. I was a little worried about whether we could meet your
expectations."  
  
Millgangga narrowed his eyes.  
It was meant to be a smile—having been here for decades, he had become
quite accustomed to their culture.  
  
'I'd like to talk to you both, along with our researchers, in the
future. But first, I have some personal questions I'd like to ask—'  
"Yes, with pleasure."  
  
The two also smiled as they replied.  
  
It was certainly a mythical encounter. A super-high-density etheric
rainbow that swallows stars. An etheric vortex that even the
Minalshians, who have almost no ability to perceive it, could observe.  
  
To hear that a single life form created it—even Millgangga, a Minalshian
who built a civilization across the galaxy, was awestruck. An entity
capable of massive etheric use that transcends etheric limits—in
planetary civilization, it could be called a god. Or perhaps its power
wouldn't even be limited to a single planet.  
  
The entity believed to be Alberinea appeared immediately after the warp
out.  
  
'Hmm, Krische understands… so that's it. It was quite a large amount of
energy. Krische might have jumped to conclusions a little bit. Um…’  
  
Judging from her actions, she accurately grasped their combat strength
and undoubtedly came to protect the planet. It seemed unlikely that an
entity capable of silently attacking and subduing a fleet capable of
warp travel would possess power limited to a single planet.  
  
It was likely that she could perceive and control a vast expanse of
space.  
There was also no guarantee that his home planet, Minaldoria, wasn't
within her range of influence.  
  
That's why he pursued an exchange with the Venua.  
Having been noticed by such an entity, he had take a friendly approach
and hasten the conclusion of a non-aggression pact. He had to eliminate
the possibility that other Minalshians, those unaware of the situation
or overly optimistic, might try to conquer the Venua under the guise of
eliminating a threat.  
And he was also certain that they would be a great help in eliminating
dangerous creatures like the Arnia. For the peace of the universe,
Millgangga was determined to obtain their assistance.  
  
The problem is that they hadn't been able to open a direct dialogue with
them. They had been arranging meetings with the scholars frequently, but
the Queen Group (as they're informally called) didn't seem to be
interfering with surface society.  
The two scholars said that they were watching humanity from the
shadows.  
  
Despite several near-extinction events caused by wars, tectonic shifts,
and meteorite impacts, this planet had survived and repeatedly rebuilt
itself. The two scholars believed that the Queen Group's power was
behind this, but there was s no record of them appearing publicly or
interfering politically. Most of the legends about the Queen Group
described encounters with gods in extreme environments.  
  
He came to understand all too well that they were not people you could
just meet, and it was one of his biggest worries.  
At least, no major problems had occurred.  
While some people were scared of or disliked the Minalshians who came
from space, it was within expectations, and any related incidents had
been minor.  
Seeing as the Queen Group hadn't contacted them with warnings or
anything, they suspected the Queen Group wasn't particularly concerned,
but their uncertainty remained.  
  
'Perhaps they're leisurely sightseeing. They seem to have spent
thousands of years without interacting with us.'  
'Aralize would think that, wouldn't she? There's probably some deeper
consideration—'  
  
The idea came to him after hearing such a thought.  
  
"…?"  
"What's wrong?"  
"Oh, no…I thought I saw a momentary error."  
"Show me."  
  
Many tourists visit under the guise of a public viewing of the interior
of the spaceship, creating quite a lively atmosphere. As they're a
relatively friendly species, there were some opinions that displaying
the interior of a spacefaring vessel, even an old one, packed with
advanced technology, was risky. However, they weren't yet at a
technological level where they could understand or analyze it.  
  
The Minalshians intended to continue this for a year or so, changing
locations depending on the results, but there was a response two months
after the launch. They increased the number of surveillance personnel,
put in place a comprehensive security system, and Millgangga himself
stayed on the ship as much as possible during the event.  
On that day, he looked at the footage after hearing the words of a
soldier on surveillance duty,  
  
"There doesn't seem to be any abnormalities—?"  
  
Then he slapped his tail on the floor.  
He recovered from the tingling pain and looked at the image.  
  
The footage showed an area where people experience an old-model space
fighter used for space combat.  
A group of people, including Venua in white and black clothing—the
old-fashioned apron dress—were enjoying themselves in it.  
Very cheerful Venua people.  
It was an unremarkable sight, but there was something off.  
  
'—The objective is to find the Queen Group and negotiate directly. Their
names are Krische and Bery, or possibly Kreschenta, Selene, Elvena,
Anne, Lira, or similar names. The group is characterized by their apron
dresses; some may wear swords. Their language is a dialect of the
unified language. They are thought to possess the ability to interfere
with perception—'  
  
Millgangga's eyes widened as the recording he'd prepared was played.  
  
"Pick up the conversation and analyze the language. Have the other
observers focus their surveillance on the test ride area and its
surroundings, monitoring the movements of the group in apron dresses.
Repeat, apron dresses, apron dresses. And summon Gilyurya to the
reception room immediately."  
"Y-yes!"  
  
He rushed off immediately to the test ride area, ignoring the surprised
onlookers.  
Upon arrival, he quickly scanned his surroundings and replayed the
recording.  
  
"——The objective is to find the Queen group and negotiate directly.
Their names are Krische and Bery, or possibly Kreschenta and Selene.
Elvena, Anne, Lira, and similar names are possibilities. The group's
characteristic is apron dresses; some may carry swords. Their language
is a unified language with a dialect. They are believed to possess the
ability to interfere with perception——"  
  
Apron dresses, apron dresses.  
Millgangga, who had almost forgotten what he was looking for, approached
the group of seven enjoying test rides without regard for the
onlookers.  
  
"Excuse the interruption, I am Millgangga, Supreme Commander of the
Minalshi Expeditionary Fleet."  
  
He spoke in translated Unified Language, and the moment they turned to
look, he felt the air change. An indescribable, instinctive unease. The
previously vague group in apron dresses solidified into a tangible
presence before his eyes for the first time.  
  
"Ah, you're that space lizard from before,"  
  
An individual named Bery with red fur. Krische, who had been riding a
small ship on her lap, spoke up.  
  
"Ah, the other day..."  
  
Bery nodded in agreement. Then an individual with golden fur looked at
her with an indescribable expression.  
  
"Ojou-sama, that's the Minalshi commander who was on the spaceship
Krische boarded a little while ago."  
"...Are you alright?"  
"I wonder...?"  
  
The individual displayed a typical Venua expression of utter
bewilderment.  
  
"There's no need for alarm. If you would be so kind, we would like to
speak with you, and have a room prepared." 
<br /><br />

  
He had anticipated some commotion, but despite this, the surrounding
Venua people, and even the Minalshi personnel on duty for guidance and
security, remained calm.  
The same was true of Millgangga as he guided them.  
  
"You silly thing, this is all because you just barged in without
thinking."  
"Uuu..."  
  
The terrifying Krische, however, was having her cheek pinched and was
being scolded by the golden-haired individual during their journey,
making their power dynamics unclear. Observing them, it seemed that this
individual—Selene—was the leader of the group. However, upon being
invited to the spacious reception room, which was set up for Venua
people, it was the individual with red-tinged golden fur who naturally
sat in the center.  
She looked at Bery with displeasure, grimaced at the offered chair, and
then had Bery sit. She perched on top of her. Krische watched this with
dissatisfaction, sighed, and moved to sit on top of Selene, while the
others stood and watched with wry smiles. Four of them were wearing
apron dresses—it was safe to say that they were a group wearing apron
dresses. While there was also a female individual in what looked like
underwear, as the records indicated, they were all female and the apron
dresses were a distinguishing feature, so the information seemed
correct.  
  
"Welcome, Millgangga-sama. I am... yes, Queen Kreschenta, ruler of this
world."  
"...My greetings, Your Majesty Kreschenta."  
  
The central figure was wearing a fine white dress with elegant silver
ornaments. The others didn't contradict her statements, and seemed to
leave things to her—she was likely the leader.  
She was likely the same Queen who ruled the great nation of Alberan in
ancient times.  
  
Even Alberinea, who was treated as a servant, possessed the power to
easily subdue the Minalshi fleet. Millgangga addressed her with the
respect due a monarch, equal in status to his own sovereign.  
  
"As I said, we have no hostile intentions. We were simply searching for
you to seek an opportunity for dialogue."  
"Then rest assured. We have neither hostility nor interest in you,
unless you intend to do something to this planet."  
"I am relieved to hear that. Our purpose is to interact with the
inhabitants of this planet and provide technological enlightenment. The
universe holds many threats; it is the mission of the Hypergalactic
Minalshi Empire to protect pre-interstellar civilizations and teach them
how to counter such threats."  
  
Kreschenta didn't react particularly, and Millgangga continues.  
  
"Of course, colonization is part of our objectives, but we will do so
with consideration for the local civilization, prioritizing
co-prosperity over domination. This has been our policy for fifty-seven
years in this time unit, and it will remain our policy in the future,
Your Majesty."  
"Then do as you please. As I said, I have little interest. You may
negotiate with the current government as you see fit. We have no
intention of getting involved and should be treated as non-existent."  
  
She revealed that she has long since retired.  
  
"It's all rather troublesome, and I dislike the disturbance around me.
Let this be the last time you try to contact us. If that's respected,
then we'll have no further dealings, a mutual non-interference
agreement, how does that sound?"  
  
"Thank you for your kind words... those words have reassured me.
However, there is a problem... this planet is facing a crisis."  
"A crisis?"  
"Yes. It may be decades, centuries, or even millennia from now. But a
monster that can easily devour a planet or a star system, was confirmed
nearby during a visit fifty years ago."  
  
A projection was put up into the air.  
  
"I understand you don't want to be bothered by us. However, that power
to instantly seize control of a fleet... you possess the ethereal
abilities of a god. That's why we're telling you this, and if possible,
we would like your cooperation in eradicating this malignant
lifeform."  
  
Millgangga finished and turned his gaze to Gilyurya sitting beside him.
A projection display appeared in mid-air.  
It showed a colony of cosmic amoebas and the planet Kudaras, destroyed
by the Arnia.  
Images of the planet before the Arnia attack, when it was thriving, and
then after the Arnia engulfed it.  
And finally, after all buildings were incinerated, the desolate
wasteland.  
  
Gilyurya spoke.  
  
"It's a sentient amoeba called Arnia that, if even a piece remains, will
absorb organic matter and multiply infinitely. Once it enters a planet,
it will bring about an irreversible disaster."  
"Amoeba..."  
"Yes, a primitive creature that can freely change shape. Normally, it
lacks intelligence, but this Arnia possesses a certain level of
intelligence and the ability to travel through space alone... and it's
becoming more strategic and tactical year by year. It's an opponent that
even our fleet struggles with... if even a single piece gets onto this
planet, the tragedy of this planet Kudaras could be repeated."  
  
Remembering the tragedy of Kudaras, Gilyurya and Millgangga quietly
swayed their tails, lowering their tips. Then they touched their right
horns, expressing their condolences.  
  
"Its ecology is still unknown. However, it possesses an unbelievable
growth rate, and in our battles with it, it has been observed to evolve
and learn. If we don't exterminate it early, this galaxy could be
overwhelmed by Arnia. Therefore, even if only for now, we want your
help... that's what we're thinking... this is actually—"  
"Oh, please, behave. We're in the middle of a conversation..."  
"...?"  
  
Simultaneously with the Arnia appearing on the display, something
wriggled out of Krische's apron dress—her waist pouch—onto the table.  
A flesh-colored amoeba, wriggling and changing shape.  
It bore a striking resemblance to the one on the display.  
  
The eyes of everyone in the room shifted back and forth between the
amoeba on the display and the one wriggling on the table, in silent
stillness.  
Then, except for Krische, a look of concern, almost pity, slowly turned
towards Millgangga and the others. In the silent room, only Krische
tilted her head curiously.  
  
"Oh, sorry. Please continue. Here you go, wiggly-wiggly, over here."  
  
As if it were a pet.  
Watching Krische coax the amoeba—the Arnia—back into the pouch, Gilyurya
froze.  
  
"......"  
  
Millgangga also looked up at the ceiling as if rejecting understanding,
remembering his long-forgotten homeland. 
<br /><br />

  
——Afterwards, the long war between the Hypergalactic Minalshi Empire and
the Arnia ended with the signing of the Hypergalactic Wiggly-Wiggly
Agreement. The refusal of mutual understanding and communication, the
inhumane soft-body experiments against the ambassadors of goodwill, and
the cowardly preemptive attacks resulting in massacres. The then
Hypergalactic King Minalshea fully accepted their claim that their
species' survival was threatened by the Hypergalactic Minalshi Empire,
and declared this incident a great tragedy caused by misunderstandings
and discrepancies in the two species' forms and methods of
communication.  
  
The establishment of communication through special ether signals and the
development of translators.  
The two species subsequently faced many problems, but over a long period
of time, they forgot the days of war and set out on a path of
co-prosperity.  
  
It was said that there was a hidden hero behind this historical
reconciliation, but their name had not been revealed, and it was rumored
that a gag order was issued by Hypergalactic King Minalshea.  
However, since then, the planet Venua has been called "Oyasiki" (origin
unknown) by the Arnia and treated as their holy site.  
Many tourist amoebas visit it for pilgrimages, leading to the belief
that an unnamed Venua person was the key figure in this historical
reconciliation.

・Arnia  
An intelligent lifeform that communicates through ether.  
A cosmic species possessing robust vitality due to its amorphous nature
and advanced intelligence thanks to a neural network composed of
ether.  
While appearing as a collective consciousness or swarm, they possess
individual recognition and thought processes based on their ether neural
network, allowing each individual to freely separate and act
independently even when fused with others of their kind.  
Fusion with their own kind is akin to colony formation, a type of social
structure for them, where they engage in reproductive activities through
shared memories and experiences, and by single fission or separation
from a combined state.  
  
This species values cultural and peaceful coexistence through mutual
understanding. However, due to their unique ecology and appearance, they
are often treated as a dangerous primitive species. Typically, their
envoys of friendship are subjected to a combo of capture, mollusk
experiments, and designation as a harmful pest for extermination,
ultimately leading to a state of war with most of the species they
encounter.  
One amoeba, escaping the flames of war and washing ashore on Planet
Venua, encountered a god and was invited to a paradise called "The
Manor." This led to reconciliation with the Minalshi and other species,
who had been hostile for many years.  
Since then, a faith called the Manor Sect has become active, led by the
Holy Amoeba Wiggly-Wiggly. Amoebas wishing to receive a baptismal name
gather near Planet Venua from the far reaches of the galaxy.  
However, the holy pilgrimage site, The Manor, has a pilgrim limit
imposed by the Fierce Golden God (whose name is forbidden to be spoken
in the Manor Sect). Currently, pilgrims face waiting lists of several
millennia, and the number is increasing year by year.

—About eighty years ago.  
"...Where did you pick that up?"  
"It seems it was attacked by bad people far away and narrowly escaped
with its life. It was floating aimlessly near the planet, so Krische
picked it up..."  
"A-actually..."  
"...? Oh, Krische named it Wiggly-Wiggly. Ehehe, see, its body goes
wiggle wiggle..."
