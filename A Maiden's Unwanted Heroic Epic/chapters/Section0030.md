\*\*How to Understand the Names of Royal Nobles\*\*  
  
Example: 1, Gildanstein = 2, Carnaros = 3, Ver = 4, Sarkalinea = 5,
Alberan  
  
1. Name: Gildanstein  
  
2. Largest territory under their control: Carnaros. (Originally, it
includes all territories under their control, making it very long, so
it's abbreviated.)  
  
3. Title for male royals with succession rights: Ver; for female royals:
Vera.  
  
4. Honorary title: Sarkalinea  
  
5. Surname: Alberan  
  
Formally, between 4 and 5, military ranks such as Marshal or General, or
court positions such as Prime Minister, are included, and titles such as
Grand Duke are added after the surname. However, since the foreign words
are already long and difficult to read, in the text, the necessary rank
and position are added at the end in kanji for clarity.  
  
Basically, except for the surname, these titles aren't necessarily
inherited by children; however, unless there are problems, the eldest
child usually inherits the land and title by custom. However, the
honorary title (4), which signifies military merit, is not inherited.  
  
If a person without a surname receives the abbreviated honorary title
Nea = Quasi-Knight, they often use their place of origin as their
name.  
  
(Example) Garlen = Nea = Calca.

■Characters in "Reine"  
  
●(Grava) Reine = Albees = Vera = Alberan  
'Lawful Evil'  
  
A princess-type girl seeking love. Queen of the Alberan Kingdom.  
  
Born into the Alberan royal family as a "child of God," a baby who
didn't cry.  
  
At that time, Alberan was a declining kingdom, even though it had been
established for a long time, and the power balance between the nobles
and the royal family was shifting.  
The birth of a daughter was greatly welcomed by her father, who didn't
want to provoke the nobles by having a son, and she was named Reine,
meaning "light," as the hope for the continuation of the royal family.
However, the fact that Reine showed exceptional talent from her
childhood, as told in the legends, became a major factor in provoking
the nobles. Reine's earnest efforts to help her father became a major
point of conflict with her father, who wanted to marry her off to a
powerful noble, and she grew up without receiving his love.  
  
After absorbing the Gasle ducal family, she personally raised countless
heads on the battlefield and reconquered the entire kingdom.  
While she gained temporary stability by eliminating rebels, her heart
remained unfulfilled. Having only thought about survival since
abandoning her father, she couldn't even feel affection for her own
children, and only their future dangers haunted her. Even if they adored
her now, people's hearts are fickle. Having used and manipulated people
through physical means, she knew how easily people betray each other and
couldn't trust their love.  
  
--Even if she loved, what if love wasn't returned?  
  
Dominated by such doubts, she sought the foolish self of her past; a
baby, like a chick, who was given the name Reine and showered with
sincere love.  
  
She named her ninth child Reine, showering the innocent child with
innocent love.  
The little Reine didn't know how to doubt, was foolish, but lovely, and
simply gave her everything she sought. However, little Reine was a
foolish girl. Influenced by Feeli, she questioned the love she had
abandoned, and her doubts grew day by day. Finally, as she wished, she
decided to confront it, accepted Feeli's love, imagined the great
happiness that lay ahead--and the small crack in the closed paradise
took everything from her.  
  
Still waiting for little Reine to return to her someday, she learned of
her death, gave up everything, and chose death, feeling unwavering love
from her eldest son while despising herself for not being able to
believe it. If she could have been like that child, would she have had a
happy present?  
  
△Historical Record  
  
A queen during the middle period of the Alberan Kingdom; along with King
Bazalyshe, the founder, and King Kreshenta, the unifier, she is
considered one of the three great queens of Alberan.  
Despite being only eighteen years old, she dramatically changed the
power balance between the royal family and the nobles through her
military prowess and schemes and established an absolute regime in less
than ten years. She annexed surrounding countries, and at its peak, she
ruled from the western to the central part of the continent. She is also
known for her efforts in various academic studies, providing clear
guidelines for various disasters that had been shrouded in faith and
fantasy, such as disease prevention, architecture, civil engineering,
and astronomy, which are still used today.  
  
However, she is known as a figure with significant flaws in her
personality, such as the huge number of executions, heavy taxes on the
populace, and her hedonistic and lascivious behavior, and she is mainly
evaluated as a tyrannical queen who enforced a reign of terror. As a
result, her evaluation of domestic affairs is highly divided, especially
because her youngest child, Elsreine, whom she was said to have loved,
fled, and founded Elsren, creating a division in the nation.  
Therefore, in stories set during that time, she is often portrayed as a
ruthless villain, but she is also favored as a tragic queen who was
repeatedly betrayed and became mentally ill.

●(Els) Reine (= Vera = Alberan) = Elsren  
'Lawful Evil'  
  
A princess-type girl who wants to convey her love. The fourth princess
of the Alberan Kingdom.  
President of the Elsren Republic. Emperor of the Elsren Holy Empire.  
  
Born into the Alberan royal family as a "child of God," a baby who
didn't cry. Having received her mother Grava Reine's love in the world
she built, she grew into the girl her mother wished for, but precisely
because of that, she felt sorry for her distorted mother.  
  
--She must have so much happiness around her, but Mother can't notice
it.  
  
Wishing that the Elsren that Feeli taught her would someday be passed
on, she tried to convey it through paintings, but the death of Feeli led
to a rift, and she fled the kingdom.  
  
Elsreine, at a loss, believed the words of her trusted retainer,
Golzarias, and, wishing to someday fulfill Feeli's wish and make her
mother realize their desires, founded the Elsren Republic. She built a
utopia different from her mother's, hoping to show it and cause her
distorted mother to change her ways. However, paradise did not become
paradise. Unlike her mother, who doubted everything, Elsreine, who tried
to believe everything, her little paradise was eroded by many people who
tried to use her, and it was distorted into an unwanted form.  
  
Realizing Golzarias' betrayal, even after losing her voice, she
continued to paint, wishing for Feeli's dream and her mother's
reformation, but she despaired at the betrayal of the boy she had raised
in an orphanage and the death of Fenela.  
She could no longer see even the paradise she had idealized. Elsreine
lamented in despair. If only she hadn't been so foolish, would there
have been a different ending?  
  
△Historical Record  
  
The youngest child of Grava Reine, the queen of the Alberan Kingdom
during the middle period, and the Emperor of the Elsren Holy Empire.  
She is said to have rebelled against the tyrannical queen Grava Reine
when ordered to suppress the rebellion of the princes. Like her mother,
she is described as a genius with rare talent. In a short period, she
gathered those opposed to Grava Reine and founded the Elsren Republic,
which would later become the Elsren Holy Empire, completely dividing the
Alberan Kingdom, which ruled over half the continent.  
Afterward, she gained enormous popular support by becoming the symbol of
faith known as the "Teachings of Paradise," but the nation had many
flaws, and because she never appeared in public and continued to paint
religious pictures, the view is prevalent that she was an idealist who
disliked politics.  
Her religious paintings, said to be impossible to imitate, despite their
morbid detail, numbered over ten thousand at the time and many are still
extant today, frequently appearing at auctions.  
Her death is said to have been due to old age, but it remains a source
of much debate.

'Chaotic Good'  
  
A twisted maiden in love. A servant in the Alberan Kingdom's royal
territory.  
  
Though blessed with talent from birth, she grew into a calculating and
cynical girl.  
Following the logic that children love their parents, she tried to
devote herself to her father, but it didn't go well, and she didn't feel
any affection and didn't cry at his death. She spent her days painting
to clear her head, which was rigidly filled with logical arguments.
Queen Grava Reine, a mass of selfishness and the complete opposite of
her, appeared before her.  
Drawn to the queen, who knew love but hungered for it yet rejected
others, she decided to make it her life's goal to love her and fulfill
her heart through the words of Benulere, who served her.  
  
Seeing her deeply love Elsreine, she knew her intuition was correct,
faithfully serving her while protecting herself, becoming Elsreine's
tutor.  
She gave her everything she might have wanted and guided her.  
Elsreine, who innocently accepted her affection and conveyed it
directly, would be influenced by her soon, and she received the
happiness from the bottom of her heart for the first time.  
Just as she did, she was stabbed by an assassin and lost her life.
Crying that the paradise that had come so close was fading into the
distance.  
  
△Historical Record

'Lawful Good'  
  
An unfortunate beautiful young man unloved. The first prince of the
Alberan Kingdom.  
  
Born as a child of the Duke of Gasle, he is a young man who cannot
forget the affection of Grava Reine, faintly remembered from his early
childhood. While he understands that the memory was only her acting like
a good mother, he cannot forget it.  
Despite being gifted, he fell far short of his mother's demand for
"talent equal to her own," and although he diligently worked hard, he
never received his mother's love. He deeply envies and is jealous of
Elsreine, his mother's favorite youngest child. Caught between his
mother, who wished to eliminate troublemakers, and his siblings, he
suffered, and he regretted for his whole life that he ultimately caused
a situation that robbed his mother of the only happiness she desired.  
Afterward, he vowed to dedicate his life to his mother, and he strived
to fulfill that faint hope as her loyal son, but he learned of
Elsreine's death and returned to the capital by fast horse. He witnessed
his mother's death.  
  
After her death, he dedicated himself to his siblings who loved the
people, and he worked for the future of the kingdom.  
And so that people like his mother and sister, who were born into this
world, were distorted, and became unhappy, would never appear again, he
decided to remove babies who didn't cry as unwanted children from the
royal family.  
  
--To live in this world, they are too beautiful.  
  
△Historical Record  
  
The eldest son of Queen Grava Reine during the middle period of the
Alberan Kingdom.  
He endured, suppressing his feelings under the queen's tyranny, and
after her death, he was one of the great men who prevented the collapse
of the kingdom. He is known as a noble person, and after inheriting the
throne and restoring order, he immediately passed the throne to his
younger brother and served him as an advisor for the rest of his life.
Among the princes, he was the only one who never took a wife, and there
are various theories about the reason.

○Golzarias = Ermen = Elsran = Schinder = Rucazan  
'Neutral Evil'  
  
A heartless man who doesn't know love. Baron → Border Count → Grand Duke
of the Elsren Holy Empire.  
  
Born with a low level of empathy, he grew up without understanding
others. Having given up on empathizing with others early on, he decided
to live for himself and integrated himself into society by analyzing and
academically understanding the psychology of others. He believes that
everything in this world is like a board game, and all people are
pieces.  
He is not interested in anything other than how to satisfy his own
desires and gain an advantage on the board. While he held himself in
high regard, upon first seeing Grava Reine, he realized that there was
someone similar to him and far superior, and he began to prioritize how
to defeat her.  
He then used Elsreine, whom Grava Reine showed unusual attachment to, to
successfully split Alberan.  
  
While possessing terrifying ability and intelligence, he continued to
use Elsreine, who also possessed foolishness. However, he felt that
Elsreine was no longer a piece on the board.  
  
A crazy person, just like him, different from other people. Yet, a girl
who desperately tried to convey something, diligently painting. A girl
who, unlike him, did not give up and yearned for the world of fools.  
He gradually began to care less about the "game" and more about what
kind of ending Elsreine would face, and his deceptive loyalty turned
into heartfelt loyalty.  
He would not hesitate to die if she wished it; he didn't understand that
foolish and strange feeling, yet he served her and devoted himself to
the "nation for everyone" she desired.  
In the end, he finally learned about love from her voiceless cry.  
  
--If there is an afterlife, I pray she will travel to Elsren.  
  
After that, he spent his life praying for the girl who taught him love
and living with her paintings. Hoping to be reborn in the world she
desired.

Empire.

her as a loyal subject. After his death, he passed on his family head to

'Neutral Good'  
  
A heroic man who loves the people. The second prince of the Alberan
Kingdom.  
  
Born as a son of the Duke of Gasle. Of Grava Reine's children, only he
and Seil have clearly identified fathers, but it is unknown which is the
son of the Duke Gasle.  
Like Seil, he faintly remembers Grava Reine's affection, but he is more
of a realist than his brother. Because he knows his mother's excellence,
he understands that her oppression of the people is aimed at provoking a
rebellion, and he is convinced that it will not stop. He became the
leader of the rebel army for the sake of the people and chose death.  
He thought of his mother as a pitiful woman and sincerely hoped that his
sacrifice would make this country a happy place where his mother could
find peace of mind.  
While envying Elsreine, who was loved by his mother, he had normal
affection and decided to fight, entrusting his mother's happiness to
her, and he was killed by her spear.  
  
His wife and children, who were to be executed, were left alone due to
Elsreine's subsequent flight, and his child would inherit the throne
after Grava Reine's death.

●Benure=Listol  
‘Neutral・Good’  
  
A pitiful girl who loves the warped princess. Head of the royal
household staff.  
  
Born into a prestigious family that has existed since the founding of
the kingdom, she became the head of the royal household staff.  
She is a capable person and was entrusted with attending to Gravareine,
having cared for her since infancy. She has witnessed Gravareine's
extraordinary talent and sorrow for many years.  
  
Knowing the intelligent yet purest girl she was in her childhood, she
felt more pain than anyone else watching her become warped, deprived of
love and tossed around by politics.  
  
Caught between Gravareine and the princes who did not love her, her
suffering increased with age, and she cursed her own inadequacy. Then
Elsreine was born.  
The existence of Elsreine, who received her mother's love entirely, made
the unloved princes seem even more pitiful, and she tried to act as a
bridge between them, only to realize her powerlessness.  
  
If only she could receive even a little of Gravareine's affection…  
  
With that thought, she decided to end her life, and went to Firili to
entrust everything before her death. In Firili's room, seeing Firili
happily teaching and guiding Elsreine, and the image of the "small
paradise" drawn by Elsreine, she felt true peace of mind.  
Hoping that the last of her life would be a catalyst to unfreeze
Gravareine's hardened heart, she left a letter and took her own life.  
  
That catalyst, for a brief moment, made the small paradise a reality.

by Gorzarius, she didn't suspect anything. However, the more she learned

lost her voice, but ultimately died protecting her from a fatal blow.

A capable servant, she became Elsreine's attendant in place of Firili,
under Gravareine's orders.  
She deeply respected Firili, who taught Elsreine many things, and helped
her be accepted by the other servants as just a slightly unusual girl. 
<br /><br />

On the other hand, she didn't think highly of the queen trying to
separate Firili from Elsreine, and suspected the queen of Firili's
death.  
Later, however, she learned that Firili had been invited to the queen's
bedroom and saw her visiting the room, realizing her mistake and deeply
regretting it.  
  
She, like the queen, continued to wait for Elsreine's return, but her
wish was not fulfilled. During the funeral, she placed the unfinished
portrait of ‘Elsren’ on the queen's chest before bidding her farewell

to managing his territory. However, he harbored a strong resentment
towards Gravareine after his childhood friend was executed by her for
giving advice.  
  
Because he knew how terrifying Gravareine was, he was unable to do
anything about it.

A born warrior. A warrior of Sharana.  
  
A Kre'Sharana warrior with a strong self-discipline, his strength is
said to be second only to the warrior leader and the guardian leader.  
He is a stern person to himself and others, but is compassionate. He
deeply mourned the death of the griffin that was to be his bonded mount
due to illness and gave up on finding another.  
For Kre'Sharana warriors, the death of a bonded mount is a heavy burden
and many warriors do not want to replace it.  
  
He is strongly angered by the softening of the Kre'Sharana rules, which
have produced warriors who are immature mentally and caused him to lose
his younger brother and his pregnant wife. He is the leader of the
conservatives in Kre'Sharanaa.  
  
While acknowledging Alberinea, who has become a friend of the Holy
Spirit, he is displeased with Winsril and Arkyrens, who have steered
towards reconciliation with the lowlands using that as a reason. He
believes that excessive contact with the people of the lowlands distorts
Kre'Sharanaa's rules and initially held hostility towards Argoshe and
others, but changed his mind after seeing Argoshe challenge the emerald
tiger alone despite his lack of skill and protecting those who could not
fight. He handed him the breastplate, the mark of a warrior.  
  
He still prioritizes the rules, and although they clashed several times
due to differences in opinion, those were differences of opinion based
on their shared desire for the future of their village. He did not
negate their opinions themselves, and welcomed his visits as a friend
who shared the same aspirations. He never left the mountains, but when
he heard of his death, he erected a spear as a tomb marker, mourning his
death as a warrior.  
  
Even he was dumbfounded by Alberinea, who hunts emerald tigers like
rabbits and captures storm wings.

○Cax ‘Neutral・Good’  
  
A loyal aide. Chief private soldier of the Gietern family.  
  
He is a private soldier employed by the Gietern family and is one of the
people Argoshe always accompanies. He has served the Gietern family
since his father's time and has been training since childhood. He was
selected as the chief private soldier by Argoshe, who recognized his
talent.  
  
Having witnessed his dedication to the people, putting himself second,
since childhood, he dedicates his life to his master. He also diligently
studies the ancient language of Kre'Sharanaa with Argoshe and can speak
it without any problem in everyday conversation, showing his
intelligence.  
  
He always accompanies Argoshe on his visits to Kre'Sharanaa. He falls in
love with a Kre'Sharana woman and is caught between loyalty and love,
but is blessed by Argoshe and they are able to be together, albeit with
some problems. Afterward, they moved to a village built on the mountain
that serves as the border between the two countries and worked hard for
its development.

○Beekils=Graffsharana ‘Order・Neutral’  
  
A bedridden warrior. Kre'Sharanaa elder. Former Kre'Sharanaa clan
leader.  
  
Once a great spear master, even the current clan leader, Arkyrens, could
not match him. At that time, his excessively strict personality was
feared by the people of the village, but as he grew older, he began to
wonder if his stubbornness was truly correct.  
  
Therefore, after relinquishing his position as clan leader, he decided
that the future should be decided by those who live in the future,
entrusting everything to Arkyrens and others, and decided to watch over
them.  
Hearing about Alberinea, who challenged the holy spirit, and her
childlike purity, strengthened his belief and he began to accept the
changes in the village.  
  
Constant tension will inevitably lead to breaking.  
It was time to relax, he thought, and watched the village accept Argoshe
before peacefully passing away.

■――Characters in ‘Threat Lurking in the Abyss’  
  
○Milganga=Go=Shea ‘Order・Neutral’  
  
A pitiful Overlord. Commander of the 237th Expeditionary Fleet. Seventh
Prince of the Ultra-Galactic Minarcy Empire.  
  
The seventh prince of the Ultra-Galactic Minarcy Empire, a superpower
that rules over multiple galaxies, and a hero of the same country.  
He has run through countless battlefields with his fleet, achieving
victory over hostile aliens and unimaginable cosmic creatures, and is
revered not only by the military but also by the common people.  
  
He appeared with his fleet to investigate the planet Benua and raise the
local civilization to a space-faring one through diplomacy and
technological enlightenment, discovered by Giryuryu, a renowned
exploration engineer and researcher.  
Compared to their technology, which can modify stars and star systems,
creating countless celestial structures, the local civilization is what
can only be called prehistoric primitives.  
  
He thought it was not a difficult task, but his thinking changed when a
high-density etheric being calling herself a servant, ‘Krische,’
suddenly boarded his flagship and instantly subdued him.  
  
Recognizing her as a god-like being with literally different dimensional
power, and considering that she could cause a cosmic disaster, he
attempted as much friendly local interference as possible. With the
cooperation of two female researchers from the local area, he was able
to reunite with her.  
  
He learned from her, who treated the top-class hostile space creature,
Arnia, like a pet, and received a design blueprint for a high-precision
ether translator that could be mass-produced using her technology, and
thus set on the path to reconciliation with Arnia.  
  
Afterwards, the video record was disclosed only to the Ultra-Galactic
King Minarshea and the two cooperating researchers and was then
destroyed.  
  
○Giryuryu=Ge=Ryuryu ‘Chaos・Good’  
  
An adventurer seeking the unknown. Exploration engineer. Researcher of
alien cultures.  
  
A Minarcy person who has longed for the outside of the known world since
childhood and chose the path of a researcher.  
Only for his dreams, for a world yet unseen, he devoted himself to the
discovery of extraterrestrial life forms from vast amounts of
astronomical data, launching tens of thousands of unmanned vehicles into
the depths of space, and achieving various feats.  
  
Planet Benua was the greatest discovery of his life, and he volunteered
to join the dangerous expeditionary fleet.  
Just as he was moved by seeing his research being recognized by
Milganga, who had financially supported his research, he encountered the
unknown transcendent being, ‘Krische.’  
  
He lived much longer than expected, and passed away after witnessing the
conclusion of the Ultra-Galactic Unyoon Agreement.  
  
○Ararize=Quilos ‘Chaos・Good’  
  
A blonde woman who is seemingly carefree but actually very caring. Ether
researcher.  
  
A blonde beauty who researches ether near the World Tree.  
She is a fun-loving woman who mainly researches irregular ether
movements and primordial engravings that have yet to be fully
understood.  
As a researcher, she is not particularly well-funded.  
  
Because her family is wealthy, she had been conducting research as a
kind of hobby, but with her cooperation with Milganga becoming a topic
of conversation, her research funding has increased, much to her
delight.  
  
She has known Milganga since university. With their shared goal of being
near the World Tree, she has established a research institute next to
the ‘World Tree of Alberan’ in Alberania.  
Forced to endure Milganga's stories about Alberan, she has some
knowledge but isn't an expert, and was practically forced to join
Milganga's invitation.  
  
She noticed the discrepancies between Alberinea's immense use of ether
and her carefree girl-like appearance and various legends about her,
commenting, "This is what history is all about," with a sigh.  
  
Someone seems familiar.  
  
○Milsey=Gesia  
'Chaos・Good'  
  
A girl prone to strong convictions. An archaeologist.  
  
An archaeologist researching a magical civilization that once existed
near the World Tree.  
  
Became obsessed with history after watching a historical novel set in
the late Alberan era; an Alberan otaku.  
  
Extremely knowledgeable about her interests, but completely clueless
about everything else – an extreme person; shy and lacking in life
skills.  
  
She would never leave the research institute if Alalize didn't take her
out.  
  
She is also ignorant of the world, and initially didn't even understand
who Milganga was when invited.  
  
When later shown the meeting between them by Milganga, she became
excitedly agitated, causing Milganga trouble by wanting to meet them.  
  
She strangely resembles someone.

Road'

Prioritizes, for better or worse, finding a good gentleman, and shows no
interest in politics or advancement like a typical royal servant.

ultimately never found anyone, eventually marrying through an arranged
marriage in her hometown and living happily ever after.  
  
■――Characters from 'Solitary Heaven, Moon on Water'  
  
○Kazuma Tesshusai (Fujisai)  
'Chaos・Neutral'  
  
A man of the sword, a seeker.  
Head swordsmanship instructor of the Imperial Family. Founder of the
Koten Suigetsu-ryu style.  
  
Born the second son in an unnamed kendo dojo, he grew up surrounded by
swords from childhood.  
  
However, he felt no beauty in the swords of his brother, father, and
grandfather, and left home to embark on a journey of martial arts
training in search of his 'ideal sword'.  
  
He challenged any renowned martial artist he encountered, repeatedly
breaking into dojos and defeating those who came to assassinate him.  
  
In doing so, he gained the reputation of being unparalleled under
heaven.  
  
Without ever feeling he had reached his peak, he secluded himself in the
mountains, gazing at the lake reflecting the moon, and gained
enlightenment, realizing that 'the ideal sword is like the moon'.  
  
He pursued the never-reachable ideal sword, reflecting it in the water's
mirror.  
  
With the resignation that such a sword does not exist in this world and
that he himself could never attain it, he decided to dedicate his life
to bringing his own sword as close as possible to that ideal, taking on
students with slight hope and teaching them swordsmanship, but only
finding them to fall short of even his own skill.  
  
By the time he had grown bored even with imperial viewing matches, he
heard the name of Oribu Rimena, considered the greatest swordsman on the
continent.  
  
And in the imperial viewing match where he invited her, witnessing her
techniques that surpassed his imagination, he truly saw the moon. He was
ashamed of his own narrow-mindedness, and afterwards changed his name to
Tesshusai, adding 'Koten' to his school's name.  
  
That sword, unattainable and high in the heavens, yet certainly
existing, was never an illusion.  
  
Feeling a revival of the vitality of his boyhood, seeing the beautiful
form he had sought from the depths of his heart.

Known as one of the sword saints in Tosho Nation.  
  
The founder of the Koten Suigetsu-ryu style, he is said to have fought
Albelinea in an imperial viewing match and engaged in a evenly matched
battle, but the details of this are subject to various
interpretations.  
  
Regarding a subsequent match, there are no extant records of the
outcome, with opinions differing on whether the students, the recorders,
did not record the result to protect his honor or if the match ended in
a draw.

■――Characters from 'Spa☆Cry'  
  
○Shelbaz=Albys=Vel=Alberan  
'Order・Neutral'  
  
A brother-like man burdened with regret. King of the Alberan Kingdom.  
  
The Alberan king caught between his magnificent father, a great king,
and Gildanstein, who seemed born to be king.  
  
While not lacking in talent, he grew up plagued by feelings of
inferiority, trapped between those with overwhelmingly greater
abilities, and struggled with his unworthiness as a king.  
  
He deeply regrets killing Krische, and was deeply saddened when he
learned that the subsequent Kreschenta was also a child who did not
cry.  
  
While he doubted it when he heard it was a mistake, he comes to deeply
love Kreschenta, who shows the image of an 'ideal princess'.  
  
After the deaths of the princes who were born later, many around him
thought Kreschenta, who did not cry as a child, brought misfortune, but
because of his guilt over taking the life of her sister, he continued to
believe in his children without doubt.  
  
He regrets causing political unrest and twisting Gildanstein by not
giving up the throne to him, and in an alternate timeline, entrusts the
two to him.  
  
Overall, a very self-punishing person.
