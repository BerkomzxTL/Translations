## Chapter 353: Krische's Krische – Evening

—Afternoon.  
  
"After realizing Krische-sama wasn't in the kitchen even at
lunchtime..."  
"...Shut up."  
  
In front of Selene's workshop, on a table in the garden, sat a basket
and a tea set.  
Two girls, one with gold and the other with silver hair, both slightly
disheveled, were eating sandwiches, one in a bad mood, the other in a
good mood.  
Selene, her cheeks flushed, poured tea, glaring meaningfully at the
red-haired servant.  
Krische, cheeks relaxed in happiness, satisfied her hunger.  
  
"Onee-sama, what do you think? I made these sandwiches, you know."  
"Ehehe...They're delicious. The sauce has a nice kick."  
  
Kreschenta pushed her chair closer and placed various colorful
sandwiches in front of Krische.  
She rubbed against Krische like a dog wagging its tail, begging for
praise, and Krische stroked her head, nodding as she looked at the
sandwiches.  
  
The vibrant colors poked out from the cross-section.  
Even Bery wouldn't be able to match Kreschenta's skill in presentation
and visual appeal, a cook who said so herself.  
Sandwiches, a simple dish of filling between bread, but the presentation
was masterful.  
Usually a frivolous, sloppy, irresponsible, silly, and clingy younger
sister, but when it comes to cooking, she's truly impressive.  
  
It wasn't about the how, but the simple, delicious impression it gave
even at just a glance.  
And the taste didn't disappoint.  
Colorful sandwiches with meat and vegetables, fried foods, eggs, and
fruit.  
The afternoon hunger was sated with happiness.  
  
"Onee-sama, try this one next."  
  
Krische took another sandwich, chewed, and nodded.  
A delicate soup suggested by Krische in the morning, and a simple,
direct sandwich at noon.  
It was a truly good flow.  
This meant there was plenty of room for a rich and creamy pumpkin gratin
for dinner.  
  
"Sigh, if you just scold the Ojou-sama a little, she only gets noisy...
She plugs her ears to avoid hearing inconvenient words, so she can
lecture others while thinking she's a sensible person."  
"A-anyway...The frequency is completely different between you and
me...It's mostly all your fault."  
"...Mine?"  
  
Selene blushed and looked away.  
  
"A-anyway, I admit fault this time. But that doesn't mean your usual
life is healthy, and whether it's forgivable. You need to reflect a
little."  
"I'm troubled. I'm trying my best to endure and reflect every day..."  
"You're too lenient with yourself in terms of endurance and
reflection."  
"The Ojou-sama also makes excuses every time something happens. Strict
with others and lenient with yourself; I don't think it's something to
be praised..."  
"I don't want to hear it from you!"  
  
Seeing this, Kreschenta sighed, saying, "Here we go again," with a weary
expression.  
Krische laughed and stroked her sister's head.  
  
"Ojou-sama, even if I were to concede that I'm lenient with myself... I
wouldn't put myself on a pedestal and treat others harshly like you do.
I at least have the right to offer criticism—"  
"No! Even if everyone in the world had the right to complain to me, you
absolutely don't have the right to!"  
"...Is that so? No, as you say, perhaps I truly don't have such a
right..."  
  
Bery shook her head sadly.  
  
"That the Ojou-sama has become someone who scolds others with such
emotion, that she has become so twisted...it is the responsibility of
me, her tutor...It's all my fault."  
"You're a genius at making people angry..."  
"Well, to be called a genius is embarrassing..."  
"I'm not praising you! You know what you're doing!"  
  
While listening to this exchange, Krische ate sandwiches and drank
tea.  
The fights between the two (sometimes resulting in the tragic omission
of Krische's food) was always enjoyable and heartwarming.  
  
Selene always says she isn't having fun, that she's not doing it
willingly, but somehow it always looks like she's enjoying herself.  
Thinking about it, it's strange.  
She scowls at Bery, and it looks like she's angry no matter how you look
at it, yet somehow it looks fun.  
  
In the past, it was all as it seemed, all as it was heard.  
If she laughed, it meant she was laughing, and if she was angry, it
meant she was angry.  
Krische was a simple person, so she could only understand simply.  
  
Fun was just fun, happiness was happiness, unpleasantness was
unpleasantness, and she didn't know about the subtle differences in
these emotions, and she probably wasn't very interested.  
She felt and accepted everything vaguely, and recognized what she
couldn't understand.  
  
It was probably first when Grace protected her from the bandits.  
She accepted strange things as they were, and then came to the
mansion,  
  
—That feeling is called sadness.  
  
It was Bery who gave answers to various mysteries.  
Bery gave names to Krische's emotions one by one, gave her the
opportunity to name them, and the world became vast and complex.  
The time spent on "not understanding" became enjoyable.  
No matter how difficult or incomprehensible the problem was, it felt
like she could understand if she asked Bery, and that time spent racking
her brains and seeking answers was pleasant.  
  
The human heart is like a soup you can't taste.  
Various ingredients are dissolved, and only the colored surface and
aroma are visible.  
Yellow, amber, brown, and white, you can't tell what kind of soup it is
just by looking.  
But if you understand each ingredient mixed in there, you could imagine
what it tastes like.  
  
Looking at, stirring, an unknown soup that will never be tasted.  
Bery taught Krische that such time could be enjoyable.  
  
"What are you laughing at?"  
"Uuu..."  
  
Selene pinched Krische's cheek and glared at her.  
  
"Please don't take your anger out on Onee-sama just because you're about
to lose in a petty argument."  
"That's right, Ojou-sama, taking your anger out on others isn't good."  
"Uuniii..."  
  
Kreschenta hugged Krische tightly and pulled her closer, stretching her
cheek even further,  
  
"It's not taking my anger out on you, it's this idiot who started it
all."  
  
Krische leaned against Kreschenta from the force of being released,
rubbing her cheek.  
  
"Uuu... That, Krische thinks she received the punishment Selene said she
would..."  
"Hmm? So you're saying you kept me company as punishment?"  
"Th-that's not it...U-um..."  
  
As Krische avoided Selene's glare, Bery's eyes wandered and she nodded,
"I see."  
Sitting down in a chair, she leaned close to Selene, smiling while
peering into her face.  
  
"Fufu, I think I have a rough idea."  
"...Stop making that infuriating face."  
  
Bery chuckled, shaking her shoulders, before stroking Selene's cheek and
kissing her.  
Selene blushed, glaring with a grumpy expression, and Bery traced her
lips with her finger.  
  
"That's just how it is. ...I'm just being myself. Why don't you relax a
little? If you're envious, try loosening up a bit?"  
"Listen..."  
"As I've said many times since then, there's no such thing as winning or
losing, is there? Such trivial orders are, literally, trivial."  
"From the perspective of someone at the top of a trivial order, that's
how it would seem, I suppose. I'm not going to do as you say, forever
and ever."  
  
Selene replide grumpily, while Bery laughed in contrast.  
  
"Then, as a servant, is it my duty to be envied forever by such a
stubborn Ojou-sama? It seems we will have an endless relationship, even
beyond a thousand, ten thousand, a billion years."  
"You've got that time now, I'll make you howl someday."  
"Well, fufu, I look forward to it."  
  
Bery smiled softly at the defiant Selene.  
  
As if it were none of her business.  
Krische smiled as she listened to the conversation, and Kreschenta
watched on with a weary look. 
<br /><br />

  
The sun began to set, and after finishing tea, Selene returned to the
workshop with a grumpy but good-humored expression.  
Krische and the others headed towards the farm stretching behind the
house.  
Kreschenta, who fell asleep mid-conversation, slept soundly in Krische's
arms in the clear sunshine.  
  
"In terms of type, even the same human beings have quite different
orientations. Yes...The Ojou-sama is, so to speak, someone who loves to
give it her all."  
"Someone who loves to give it her all..."  
"Yes, she places value on the very act of exerting her strength."  
  
Bery made several water cats with a flick of her finger, watching the
surrounding fruit trees and smiled.  
The sprites moving around her feet and surroundings jumped and rejoiced
when they saw the water cats.  
  
"The goal is the process, not the result. For the Ojou-sama, the
greatest pleasure is to challenge a goal that she cannot reach even
after giving it her all. She approaches crafts knowing it's something
she struggles with because the act of challenging itself is the
purpose."  
"...Hmm."  
"Fufu, as Krische-sama says, if she focused on one thing without looking
away, she could have made a wonderful knife, but if she sees an
interesting challenge, she'll jump around. Time is eternal, she uses
that excuse to have a lot of fun."  
  
Bery chuckled softly.  
  
"While often challenging me to a match, what the Ojou-sama seeks is not
victory, but the process. She isn't seeking victory, so it's a head-on
match, openly stated. For example, even though she knows she'll win if
she uses scissors, she desperately wants to challenge my paper with her
fist."  
  
She wrapped her fist in her palm with a wry smile.  
  
"The Ojou-sama's enjoyment isn't in beating me with a stone fist; it's
in challenging me with it, so it is my role to show her paper every time
she challenges me. She sulks and complains, including her regret at
losing – that whole process is what she enjoys."  
"Hmm, Krische kind of gets that."  
  
Krische nodded.  
She challenges in incomprehensible matches, loses, and each time Selene
gets angry or sulks, but a few days later she's energetic, saying she
will definitely win the next match.  
Her appearance is always fun to see.  
Selene is certainly that kind of person.  
  
"Of course, the Ojou-sama might say she wants a draw once in a while,
but...the Bery that the Ojou-sama wants is surely a Bery that will
relentlessly show paper. Even if I were to honestly engage in a
fistfight, and she won, she wouldn't be satisfied."  
  
Krische considered this.  
From what she's seen so far, Bery has been winning as she should, and
Selene has been losing as she should.  
Bery makes thorough preparations to win, setting up layers of traps over
decades, even guiding the content of the match, while Selene charges
into the traps like a boar.  
She seems to be aware of the traps but leaps into them knowingly.  
Tactically, it's the worst.  
  
However, the reason she challenges head-on is that she wants to defeat
Bery, who sets up traps, head-on.  
She has often said so.  
  
Now, imagine if Bery engaged in a match without setting any traps.  
If Selene won, imagining her expression... She can only imagine a grumpy
or dissatisfied face.  
She wouldn't be joyfully celebrating.  
  
"In that respect...fufu, you're similar to Kreschenta-sama."  
"Kreschenta?"  
  
As Krische held Kreschenta, Bery tickled Kreschenta's nose playfully.  
Kreschenta frowned and squirmed.  
  
"Like Kreschenta-sama who says she's great while wanting to be treated
like a child, the Ojou-sama wants to win while wanting to lose...It's
all backward."  
  
"It's cute, though," Bery said with a chuckle, shaking her shoulders.  
Watching Bery, Krische smiled quietly.  
  
Fifteen years of life makes one a social adult.  
A thousand years, and everyone can be called an adult.  
But even now, Selene is more of a sister, and Kreschenta is a younger
sister.  
Bery, on the other hand, has been an adult since Krische met her.  
It seems like they see things a little differently.  
  
Or what they try to see, where they try to stand.  
  
"...Ehehe, Krische might be like that too."  
"Well,"  
  
They leaned closer, and Krische got her head stroked while rubbing
against Bery's hand.  
  
"Krische wants to be a fine servant like Bery, but Krische loves being
pampered like this... In front of Bery, Krische will always be a
child."  
  
It's not that she doesn't want to be an adult.  
But it felt good to be treated like a child, to be spoiled.  
Probably Selene and Kreschenta feel the same, she somehow knows it.  
A strange feeling, difficult to put into words.  
  
Bery traced her lips, thought for a moment, and spoke gently.  
  
"Fufu, adults are ultimately the accumulation of childhood. ...A part of
the child remains in the heart forever. For example, even I, who praises
you, would be a stubborn little sister who can't be honest if I met my
Nee-sama again, a child. ...It doesn't change no matter how old you
get."  
"Is that how it is?"  
"I think so. I'll treat my Nee-sama as an older sister, and my Nee-sama
will treat me as a younger sister."  
  
With long eyelashes hiding her light brown eyes, Bery smiled happily.  
  
"If Krische-sama met Gallen-sama, your parents, and Gala-sama now, what
would happen? Would you still say you're an equal adult?"  
"...No."  
"Gallen-sama will treat you as a beloved granddaughter, your parents and
Gala-sama as a beloved daughter. If you both find that comfortable, that
will naturally become the way things are."  
  
Then, slightly ahead of Krische, Bery turned around with a slight sway
of her skirt.  
  
"My eternal goal is to walk one step ahead of Krische-sama, pretending
to be an adult."  
"Ah..."  
  
Reaching out and stretching, she gently stroked Krische's head.  
  
"I don't want to be overtaken, so please rely on me a lot and let me
spoil you."  
  
Krische stared intently at the smiling Bery and nodded.  
  
"Selene always says it, but Bery is a little sly."  
  
"Winning as you should win is the family motto of the Christand family.
As your tutor, I must use any means necessary, including underhanded
tactics, to avoid losing to the strong Krische-sama."  
"...Ehehe."  
  
Bery stroked Krische's cheek, then removed her hand and gestured towards
the surrounding fields.  
"As a first step, let's have tonight's dinner. Which pumpkin should we
use?"  
"Eh?"  
  
They had arrived at the pumpkin patch during their conversation.  
Surprised by the question, Bery tilted her head.  
  
"I thought you were in the mood for pumpkin, but maybe I was wrong?"  
"N-no, Krische was about to say that..."  
"That's good. Fufu, if we're making gratin, a small, sweet one is
best."  
  
She folded her skirt above her knees and knelt down, placing her hands
on a small pumpkin.  
Realizing that Bery had seen through her, Krische blushed and looks
confused.  
  
"Um, Krische was looking forward to eating pumpkins so much...?"  
"Yes...It's half deduction, half intuition."  
  
Bery put her hand to her mouth, shook her shoulders, and held up the
pumpkin.  
  
"It seemed like Krische-sama was making a pumpkin face."  
  
Krische's eyes wandered as she looked between the smiling Bery and the
pumpkin.  
*Bery is still a little sly,* she thought, pouting.  
  
"...Even without any help, Bery wouldn't be overtaken by Krische."  
"Well, I'm just doing my best to show you what I can do."  
  
No matter how hard she runs, Bery would always be one step ahead.  
Even if she stopped, one step ahead.  
Always one step ahead of Krische.  
Even if she goes behind or sideways, one step ahead.  
At a distance she can almost reach, always waiting, always giving.  
For all eternity, that day will never come.  
  
While saying that she's the same, Bery is the adult, and Krische is the
child.  
She offers a hand before she reaches out and calls it stretching.  
  
"Fufu, let's wake Kreschenta-sama and have a pumpkin competition. The
winner is the one who finds the most delicious-looking pumpkin."  
"...Yes."  
  
Bery's most sly thing is that she always gives an excuse to lose.  
Today, tomorrow, and the day after, Krische will undoubtedly be
spoiled.  
  
It's when thinking such things that Krische sometimes sees the sunset.
