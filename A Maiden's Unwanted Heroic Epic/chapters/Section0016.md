## Chapter 326: The Creation of Heaven and Earth, an Eternity of Journey III

The battlefield of Ulfenate lay ahead.  
This was one of its large warehouses.  
  
"For honor, for the people, or for a righteous cause. However, many
among you bear deep wounds that cannot be healed by such fine words."  
  
Rows of makeshift beds, nothing more than cloth spread on the floor,
held dozens of wounded soldiers. Most had suffered grievous injuries in
delayed battles.  
Several had lost limbs; the oppressive atmosphere upon entering was
daunting.  
  
The Queen's appearance surprised both the wounded and those tending to
them.  
Her deep bows before each soldier left everyone speechless.  
Ignoring calls to stop, she continued her sorrowful bows, one by one—the
cries of pain and angry shouts that had filled the air before her
arrival ceased completely.  
  
Even after she returned to the entrance, silence reigned. Only her
bell-like, clear voice resonated.  
All eyes, all attention, were fixed on the small Queen.  
  
She began with an unusual self-introduction.  
She declared herself the Queen, and spoke of Krische-sama's defeat of
the Gulshan army—a great victory, she announced, and that the Alberinea
army, having crushed Elderant, was on its way to provide support,
addressing the immobile, frightened soldiers.  
  
"—It is the fate of the battlefield that some lose their lives, or are
injured. Even those who muster courage to stand on the battlefield,
losing the use of their limbs, or losing friends. How agonizing and
painful it is to still hold onto something glorious within… I cannot
easily understand."  
  
Next, she spoke of them.  
  
"The fact that you have suffered irreparable injuries is a reality that
confronts you now, no matter how much you try to avert your gaze, and
the suffering… is something only you can understand."  
  
The Queen clasped her hands to her chest.  
Her beautiful white one-piece dress—a garment that should ideally remain
spotless—was stained with blood, a result of tending to the wounded
soldiers. The stains stood out starkly against the white.  
  
"As the Queen of this country, as the leader of all its people, I swear
to repay your loyalty to the utmost. …But even so, you will face many
hardships, and the regrets of this war will follow you. That alone will
not erase all your suffering."  
  
Her eyes welled, but she fought back the tears, continuing.  
  
"The words of one who stands before you unharmed… may sound utterly
hollow. You may feel resentment and anger… This war was the result of
my, and those above me, failings, and because of that, you bear deep
wounds of mind and body. That is a natural feeling."  
  
Still, she pleaded, looking at them.  
  
"—Never despair of your situation… Live on. If you need anger to endure
those deep wounds… then hate me if you must. No matter how much hardship
you face, just live… I want you to see the future, ten years, twenty
years from now, together with me."  
  
Her words resonated powerfully. Some covered their faces to hide their
tears; others sobbed. Others simply clenched their fists.  
  
"I will not waste your sacrifices. I will not forget today. To repay
your loyalty… I will build a nation so happy that your suffering will
fade into the past, a nation where your wounds become a badge of honor,
an honor more prestigious than any medal."  
  
She clasped her hands together in prayer, her eyes closed.  
She repeated,  
  
"I understand how difficult and painful the path I am showing you is. To
tell those who face such despair, despair that makes you want to take
your own life, to live… I understand how arrogant that sounds. But
please…"  
  
—Live, do not lose hope.  
She wiped her eyes and told them.  
  
"I swear on the name of Kreschenta Farna Vera Alberan, I will surely
deliver a nation worthy of your suffering, before you. Therefore,
please…"  
  
And once again, she bowed deeply.  
  
"My One and Only Queen," a soldier said, using his remaining arm to
salute, his hand lacking the forearm.  
His left arm was also bandaged; he couldn't even wipe away the tears
streaming down his face. The older soldier, without raising his body,
offered a salute, his gaze fixed on the ceiling. Similarly, from
elsewhere, several voices overlapped, shouting "My One and Only Queen".
Even those unable to move their bodies looked towards the ceiling, as if
fixing their gaze on a single point in front of them—offering the most
respectful salute they could manage to the Queen.  
  
—I give you my life. That's what the military salute meant, hand to
heart. But these men, without that gesture, made a perfect, flawless
salute to Her Majesty.  
  
The scene made even me unable to hold back my tears. 
<br /><br />

  
"—Ugh, I’ve been walking around and crying so much that I’m exhausted. I
wish they would group the wounded soldiers together. They should think
about those who have to look at them!"  
  
Entering a room prepared in the Velraigh borderlands, she sighed, her
expression a stark contrast to what it was moments before. Selene-sama
had gone with Elvena-sama to the border lord; only the Queen remained.  
With a flick of her finger, a blue line ran across her sleeve, instantly
cleaning the bloodstains. After taking off her shoes, she threw herself
onto the bed.  
  
"You’ve done well, Your Majesty."  
"Massage my feet for me."  
"Yes!"  
  
Using warm water from the pot and the water jug, I cleaned her feet and
massaged them. They were as soft as ever.  
  
"The smell is awful, and there are so many… I wish they’d just become
prisoners. I'm sick of this messy business."  
"But truly… those were wonderful words. Many of them were saved by Your
Majesty’s words…"  
"I hate inefficient symptomatic treatment. Anne, you wouldn't understand
that."  
"I-I'm sorry…"  
  
Despite apologizing, she couldn’t help but smile.  
The Queen often said such blatantly self-serving things, but I didn't
think it was untrue.  
She had decided to personally visit each place holding the wounded and
bowed before each of them.  
Even though she complained about being tired and annoyed, she never cut
corners.  
  
Of course, the Queen was a genius beyond comparison.  
She had genuine feelings, but it wasn't malice.  
It may not have been benevolence, but her sincerity was undeniable.  
  
She complained about tired feet and inefficiency, but never stopped.  
She didn’t use time constraints as an excuse.  
No matter how inefficient and tiring it was, she would complete it
perfectly. She even made time to do everything she could.  
  
She is surely the most sincere Queen in the world.  
Even though she says it's all an act, considering how happy and
empowering the right words can be for those who are suffering, I don’t
think it’s a bad thing. At least, many people present at the scene were
saved by Her Majesty's words.  
  
If a villain pretends to do evil, it's evil, regardless of the truth. A
Queen who acts as a good person and does good is good, regardless.  
If she can act perfectly, there is no better person than her.  
  
‘Kreschenta-sama is rather paradoxical. She speaks the truth as if it
were a lie, and lies as if they were truth…She probably doesn’t believe
in words.’  
‘Doesn’t believe…?’  
‘Yes. That’s why she says such things… Kreschenta-sama, who has lived a
life being doubted while acting the good girl.’  
  
When I first met the Queen, I was extremely nervous, and Argan-sama said
something like that.  
  
‘…Perhaps by acting like a bad girl, she wants people to believe she is
a good girl.’  
  
Not as a great queen, not as an Alberinea, not as a marshal.  
Argan-sama, somewhere, looked at Kreschenta, Krische, even Selene, as if
they were children.  
Regardless of their amazing abilities or positions—she only looked at
their hearts and emotions and showered them with affection. To
Argan-sama, the Queen probably appears that way.  
  
I wouldn't dare claim to be at that level, but after hearing those
words, the way I saw the Queen changed.  
The Queen certainly says blunt things, things like "stupid",
"incompetent", and "useless".  
But if I really got depressed, she would sigh and always give guidance,
saying, "do this, do that". While complaining about the trouble, saying
things like "Even Argan-sama can do this much," she always considers the
other person's feelings. The Queen is such a kind person.  
  
‘And perhaps, she wants to confirm… if people still love her.’  
  
I hardly knew the Queen when she was a princess.  
As a servant in the royal household, I wouldn't have had the
opportunity.  
But I did hear rumors of her being a cursed child.  
  
Just because she didn’t cry doesn't mean I can understand what it's like
to want to die.  
The Queen, wiser than anyone, surely understood her position from
infancy. How did she accept that injustice?  
  
I’ve never been told about this directly.  
But how much of those rumors is true? Even someone like me could
understand after spending time with her.  
  
At least, it's true that she committed a great sin that no one in the
kingdom would dare to utter. In that civil war, I think the Queen was
not on the side of truth.  
If I hadn't known what kind of person the Queen was, and had only seen
that probable truth, I might have had a different view. But having seen
the Queen as I have, I couldn't take that view.  
  
Krische-sama and Kreschenta-sama are both earnest people.  
They never cut corners, facing everything honestly, with their whole
being.  
And if they have been hurt, if I imagine the pain, it's a tragedy.  
I can't just call the resulting sin a mere sin.  
She only returned injustice for injustice. 
<br /><br />

Of course, that’s because I love this Queen.  
I understand it’s an arrogant and subjective opinion, and I understand
the injustice, but still, I think she deserves to be happier than anyone
else.  
  
At least, the Queen I've seen doesn't harbor malice towards others.  
She just does what she feels is necessary—whether it's a good deed or a
bad deed.  
  
And she definitely valued doing good if she had a choice. While saying
that it’s convenient to be liked, she walks around all day. While saying
it's troublesome, she bows to each wounded soldier and speaks to them.  
  
While saying it's to gain the support of the people, she does it as if
it were obvious.  
  
To me, she is a truly sincere Queen.  
That's the only way I see her, a great master whom I should serve
wholeheartedly. 
<br /><br />

"…Anne, it hurts. Be gentler."  
"Y-yes…"  
"I wish you would learn some moderation. …It’s all Argan-sama’s fault.
She got a fever at the worst possible time, forcing me to scold you like
this."  
  
Her words made me laugh.  
  
"What are you laughing at?"  
  
The Queen glared at me.  
  
"I…I’ll try to be more like Argan-sama."  
"Don’t try, just don’t hurt me."  
"Y-yes…"  
  
She sighed irritably.  
She said I was bad at self-care, sloppy, and worthless, constantly
putting me down, yet she mentioned Argan-sama three times a day after
leaving the mansion. She must be worried about her.  
When I say that, she says, 'I'm not worried', but we all know it's just
a cover-up.  
  
Argan-sama was terribly worried about Krische being on the
battlefield.  
She would gaze out the window looking melancholic, lost in thought,
absent-minded.  
The Queen would make excuses to take Argan-sama with her on official
business and she looked after her so much.  
While saying things like, "What do you think you're doing, bothering
me?" she would wring out a damp cloth and put it on Argan-sama's
forehead, looking very attentive.  
  
The same was true when Argan-sama was stabbed and Krische rushed out.
While complaining at Selene's bedside, she stayed there to take care of
her.  
  
She calls herself the greatest queen in the world, yet her actions are
the opposite.  
She will spare no effort for the sake of the people she loves.  
The reason she tries to be a beloved queen is probably because of that.
She thinks that her actions will please them.  
She says things are inefficient but does them with all her might.  
The Queen is Krische-sama's sister and looks exactly like her.  
  
Compared to me, she's a great Queen.  
But I think anyone can understand her feelings.  
The desire to be praised and pleased by a loved one.  
It's a feeling everyone has had to some extent as a child.  
  
I asked the Queen, who had fallen face-down onto the bed.  
  
"Shall I massage your lower back as well?"  
"Do I really have to say it?"  
"N-no… excuse me then."  
  
I gently massaged her soft, slender back that seemed about to break.  
She blinked her long eyelashes, closing them, then blinking again,
closing them, until her eyelids finally fell and she started to breathe
softly.  
  
Her sleeping face was the opposite of her public persona.  
It was adorable, like that of a child.  
I carefully covered her with a blanket without waking her and gently
stroked her head. If she was awake, she would surely scold me.  
Yet, I smiled. Gently, gently. 
<br /><br />

After leaving the mansion, the Queen gave speeches every day, observed
the people, and spoke to them to alleviate their anxieties.  
She was far more tired than usual.  
Her Majesty flawlessly handled tasks that a normal king wouldn't even
attempt. She made no excuses and cut no corners. Everyone in the mansion
was like that, and the Queen was no exception.  
  
I wonder, I think to myself, will the day come when everyone, including
Her Majesty, will be freed from various things? A day when Her Majesty
can spend the whole day like a child, without worries or strain, allowed
to rest and recuperate—will such a day ever come?  
  
I know it's very difficult, but I can't help but dream of such a
thing.  
A gentle future where this beloved Queen can spend her days like a
child, without worrying or feeling constrained. I wish for such a gentle
future to come someday.  
  
In this war-torn country, for now, she is in a gentle dream. The small
Queen was breathing peacefully.  
Watching her, I just kept stroking her head, just as Argan-sama always
does—like a beloved child. 
<br /><br />

  
Looking up, the blue sky had brilliant gradations of light. The magical
vortex emanating from the Heavenly Pole, now the World Tree, shone far
more brightly and beautifully than anything else.  
This place is apparently between worlds, between the fundamental world
and the material world, but even after Argan-sama explained it to me, I
still don't quite understand.  
Even Argan-sama seemed to find it difficult to explain, saying she only
understood it conceptually. Judging by that, I'll probably never
understand it.  
  
To put it simply, the explanation that it's like a fairy realm was the
most fitting, if I had to force one. Deep within the forest, or behind
furniture, in a cave—a world connected to the fantasy of lurking in such
places. The world of fairy tales that adults forget. This is probably
such a place.  
  
The topography is generally similar, and most of it seems to overlap.  
Even here, in terms of location, it's still within the royal territory
of Alberan.  
Even though artificial structures are invisible, there are parts of the
terrain that make you think, "Ah, I see," indeed. Alberan was located on
a gently sloping hill in the middle of a plain, and this mansion was
also on a gently sloping hill, except that it's surrounded by a forest.
When I asked why it was surrounded by a forest, Krische-sama didn't seem
to know either, saying it simply became a forest when she created it.  
  
I know that even the currently open plains were mostly forests in the
past. Perhaps Alberan was originally in a forest as well. Argan-sama
seemed interested in the possibility that the forest the army used for
training was a remnant of that. It really was a mysterious place.  
  
"…. Really, why do I have to hold a hoe? Anne, a little stronger."  
"Yes." 
<br /><br />

It's been about half a year since we came here—the whole mansion is
engaged in farming. Krische-sama knocked down trees with a whirlwind,
pulling out their roots. Selene-sama and Lira-sama trimmed the branches
and processed them into logs. Argan-sama and Elvena-sama were using hoes
to till the land in the area that had been cleared. Kreschenta-sama and
I were also hoeing, but I took a break with Kreschenta-sama, who started
complaining about how troublesome it was. I was massaging
Kreschenta-sama's feet as she sat on a rock.  
  
The mansion was quite far away now, and the cleared land behind it was
one ri square. Krische-sama had started running with something that
looked like a farming implement attached to her whirlwind. She must have
removed the trees from the area scheduled for this round of clearing.  
Selene-sama and the others were working hard, endlessly processing the
mountain of trees into logs, and maybe I should help them next.  
  
"This is ridiculous. If we used magic, it would be over in an
instant…How many days do you intend to spend on this?"  
"But it's fun, you know. I've never done farm work before, and it's
quite refreshing. I think I'm getting better at using a hoe…"  
"….In your case, it's just 'I think' you are." 
<br /><br />

Kreschenta-sama said so with a bored look. As always, her soft feet
showed no signs of stiffness or swelling.  
However, Kreschenta-sama likes massages.  
She often orders massages—shoulder rubs, foot rubs—and Selene-sama
always complains about it.  
  
However, in this world without guests, with little work to speak of,
such services for Kreschenta-sama make up half of what I consider the
duties of a servant. Personally, I thought it was okay for
Kreschenta-sama to be as capricious and self-indulgent as she pleased.  
  
Selene-sama, to begin with, is someone who usually takes care of herself
efficiently, and even Krische-sama is a servant. To be honest, we are
saturated with servants. I’m not the only one who thinks that having at
least one person like Kreschenta-sama who gives orders would be nice, as
Argan-sama and Elvena-sama seem to agree. 
<br /><br />

Considering Her Majesty, the brilliant and thoughtful Queen.  
The fact that she has become even more self-indulgent since coming here
might be her way of showing consideration. Observing Kreschenta-sama's
beauty as she acted like a spoiled child, I smiled, then frowned.  
  
"…What is that look on your face?"  
"No, I'm deeply moved to be able to serve Kreschenta-sama…"  
"Hmph, is that so…"  
"Yes! Please give me any orders, big or small. This Anne will gladly
carry out Kreschenta-sama's commands."  
"….The day I give you a significant order will never come."  
  
Kreschenta-sama said so with an utterly exasperated look. However,
Kreschenta-sama isn't straightforward. The days of my being elated or
depressed by her words are long gone. I accepted it with a smile and
continued to massage her slender feet.  
  
She’s a malicious, and not straightforward person. And surprisingly
shy—Kreschenta-sama’s way of showing affection is to use harsh words.
When she appears in public, she is always the perfect Queen, and she is
the kind of person who can act that way. The fact that she shows a
different side to us is proof that we are trusted. 
<br /><br />

Furthermore, Kreschenta-sama always told us to speak up if we had
something to say, not just one-sidedly. She almost insists that we don’t
hold back. At least, even if a mere servant like me were to make an
arrogant or impolite remark to Her Majesty, she would not get angry.
While she might cut off the conversation with a displeased look and say
that it's nonsense, she would listen carefully and surely keep
everything in mind.  
  
She is someone who responds to sincerity with sincerity, someone who
looks straight at people.  
Someone who can cherish and value such people. Selene-sama constantly
says that Kreschenta-sama is sloppy and has become even more so since
coming here, but to me, she is still the great Queen.  
I think that this assessment will never change.  
  
If this is the paradise Kreschenta-sama desired, then it is the duty of
the servants to cater to her whims.  
  
"How about this? After the break, how about helping Selene-sama and the
others…You seem tired of the hoe. It seems difficult for just the two of
them over there."  
"I refuse. A hoe and a saw are the same. Why should I, the ruler of this
place…"  
"But if you rest too much, I think Krische-sama will scold you… Ah,
that’s right. I’d really like you to teach me how to use a saw."  
"Don’t imitate that redhead. ….Fine."  
  
She put both her legs on my left arm. I suppose it means to carry her,
so I picked her up and stood up.  
  
"Argan-sama, I’ll go help Selene-sama and the others."  
  
When I called out, Argan-sama saw Kreschenta-sama being carried and gave
a laughing nod while still holding her hoe. I also smiled and looked at
Kreschenta-sama, who languidly looked up at the sky.  
Her small body was soft and light as a feather in my arms, radiating a
warm heat. I can understand why Argan-sama would want to hug her
tightly—Kreschenta-sama might have been born to be held.  
  
Looking up, the sky shone a brilliant blue, emitting a sparkling
phosphorescent light.  
There was no one else but us, no noise, and nothing but forest except
for the mansion. No official duties, no responsibilities, no conflicts,
just peaceful days.  
  
I looked down at the girl in my arms. Since coming here, Kreschenta-sama
has been like a child. She is someone who will do anything necessary—but
the intelligence and abilities she wielded are now just quirks here,
useless talents.  
In the appearance of a spoiled child, she spends her days lazily
enjoying life.  
Without worrying about other people's eyes, as if she were dreaming an
unending dream.  
  
—The world I once wished for is here, and the Kreschenta-sama I once
wished for is here. I will never see the ‘great Queen’ again as she was
before. No one needs such greatness anymore.  
  
I realized that that's fine.  
Because even so, she is still the greatest Queen to me, more than anyone
else.  
  
"…It’s fine to walk with a goofy face."  
  
As I continued to look at her, Kreschenta-sama looked at me with a
displeased expression.  
  
"Please walk while looking ahead properly? I'm worried."  
"I-I apologize. But it’s alright, surely in a place like this—ah!"  
  
My foot suddenly caught on a lingering tree root.  
  
"Ugh?!"  
  
I instinctively tried to hug Kreschenta-sama, but in the momentum, I
headbutted her forehead.
