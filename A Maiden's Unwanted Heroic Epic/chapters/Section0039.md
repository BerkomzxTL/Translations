## Chapter 349: Charm – The End

If left unattended, she would roll over to the edge of the bed; as soon
as she learned to crawl, she would scramble all over the room, and once
she started walking, she would timidly try to descend the stairs.  
Selene was a child who couldn't be left alone for a moment; just when
you thought you'd finally put her to sleep, she would suddenly wake up
to something and start moving.  
  
For her sister, she must have been a sudden boulder appearing in her
smooth daily life.  
Even Bery seemed quite perplexed by Selene's unpredictable nature, and
monitoring Lazura and Selene was added to her household duties.  
For a while, she repeatedly made small mistakes she usually wouldn't.  
Lazura would laugh at such sights, and Bery would often sigh.  
  
It was the happy daily life she had wished for.  
Yet, she had a strange premonition, and just as her sister monitored
her, Lazura also monitored Bery.  
It must have been right after Selene was born.  
As if time had stopped, Bery's growth, which had been so steady, halted.
Lazura vaguely understood why.  
  
It was said that the mind affects the body.  
Especially strongly so in nobles who possessed much magical power.  
It was similar to the saying, "Illness comes from the mind," and though
there was no firm basis, Lazura believed it concerning her sister.  
  
Loving desperately, sometimes hating, directing an entwining
affection.  
The quiet and reserved sister was dominated by deeper emotions than
anyone.  
Her seemingly rational demeanor was merely a weight to seal them away.  
  
Wishing for death, her body fell ill, even refusing to grow.  
Then, just to be useful to Lazura, she grew taller and showed her
buds.  
The large flower that would have bloomed far more beautifully than
Lazura stopped growing, its bud half-opened.  
She stood at a boundary that was neither child nor adult.  
As if to remain in the shadow of her shorter sister, never surpassing
her in height.  
  
Even though Lazura broke the contract, Bery probably continued to uphold
it.  
Perhaps it was precisely because Lazura broke the contract that it
became a weight to be continuously upheld.  
Many people live their lives normally, but her sister was a child who
couldn't live normally.  
No matter how painful it was, she was a child who couldn't live her own
life.  
  
She probably intended to leave as soon as Selene was born.  
Thinking that she would no longer be needed by her happy sister.  
But she couldn't bring herself to leave Lazura and Selene, and she
lingered.  
  
Going to kill Roland was just an excuse.  
She simply found a reason to live in that.  
Even that was not for herself, but for Lazura.  
  
Her appearance, her intellect, her talent.  
Endowed with talents everyone would envy, yet for her sister, she
herself wasn't even worth putting a price tag on—she might have even
thought of Lazura as a peculiar person who treasured a roadside
pebble.  
  
Compared to when she was a baby, Selene had gained some discernment.  
Lazura also had more leeway, and so did Bery, and it was at such a
time.  
Lazura would constantly call for her sister, ordering and indulging her,
leaning on her and holding her back, but even such days have their
limits.  
  
An expression, a gesture, a single word.  
Something felt from that atmosphere.  
Noticing that she had begun preparations to leave, that day, she went
into the kitchen together—and the twilight-colored gem melted into a
tear.  
  
Sparkling and shining, her sister's tears were always sad and
beautiful.  
"Don't cry," she said, kissing her forehead, yet tears still
overflowed.  
  
"I know your self-abasement well. You're probably thinking things like
'I'm worthless anyway' or 'that's all I can do,' aren't you?"  
  
Her sister was so self-deprecating that Lazura sometimes thought she was
being mocked.  
She probably intended to leave unnoticed. One day, she'd quietly
disappear, leaving a letter.  
  
However, Lazura watched her sister much more intently than Bery
realized, being aware of her on daily basis.  
  
"It's true that I might have what you lack. But you also have what I
lack—you are my other half."  
  
Words repeated many times, yet never understood.  
Bery didn't comprehend how important she was to Lazura.  
Because she genuinely believed she was a pebble that could be easily
discarded.  
  
"You do the housework for me, you cook... I'd be in trouble without
you."  
  
When she hugged her, a sob escaped.  
  
"Is it your wish to trouble your beloved other half, your Onee-sama?"  
  
When asked, she shook her head as expected.  
She had watched her all this time, by her side.  
Lazura was confident that she understood Bery Argan far better than this
girl did.  
  
Just as her sister admired her and resented her, Lazura was also afraid
of Bery.  
  
She didn't know what her quiet, unsmiling sister was thinking.  
She thought children cried and laughed energetically, so like the
servants, at first she kept her distance.  
Everyone, including Lazura, had hoped for and celebrated her birth, but
as soon as Bery was born, she cast a shadow over the mansion.  
It was probably true that somewhere in her heart, she found it creepy.
Just like the servants.  
  
The daughter of her beloved stepmother, and her own sister.  
She hated herself for feeling that way about such a person, and so she
decided to try and understand.  
Tidying things up one by one, giving reasons, believing it only seemed
creepy because she couldn't understand.  
  
There were many times she found her annoying, and she wasn't indifferent
to a talent that made her feel like a "pebble."  
But Bery was a poor, pitiable sister, and by looking at her with such
eyes, and pretending to understand, Lazura was merely able to be a
sister.  
  
To be truly respected and loved by such a sister from the bottom of her
heart.  
Only being such a sister allowed Lazura to be the Lazura she was now.  
Lazura, who was born a reasonably capable person, was special because
such a person was by her side.  
  
"It's a precious encounter. I want you, just like me, to be grateful for
such an encounter and to find your own happiness from now on."  
  
Her stepmother passed away, her father passed away, and there were many
painful things.  
But even if there had been a different encounter, she would undoubtedly
be here.  
Half of Lazura was, after all, made of Bery, and she wouldn't be
fulfilled otherwise.  
No matter how happy she was, she wouldn't be content without her
sister's happiness.  
  
"You're the best sister in the world. ...You have to be the happiest in
the world."  
  
Lazura was greedy.  
For her modest sister's sake, she was twice as much so.  
  
"Then I'm happy, and Bogan is too. Okay? If you're good at handling
knives, instead of thinking silly things, go make delicious food. You're
not actually planning to feed my cute Selene my cooking, are you?"  
  
If she said that, Bery would laugh.  
  
"...Nee-sama's cooking... I couldn't feed her that."  
"Exactly! I'd be in trouble if you didn't cook for me instead!"  
  
She hugged her tightly from behind, and Bery returned the embrace with
equal force.  
The breasts of the two, of similar height, crushed and melted together,
as if their hearts were connected.  
Any reason was fine.  
Just as Bery thought of Lazura as a peculiar sister who treasured
pebbles, Lazura too saw Bery as a peculiar sister.  
  
A foolish child who loved serving such a selfish and self-centered
sister.  
A silly child who would easily dedicate even her life to her sister.  
—The most beloved, most beautiful child in this world.  
  
"I love you, Bery. ...So, will you promise me?"  
  
But the day when Lazura, the betrayer, could fill this sister with
happiness would never come.  
Still, stay by my side.  
How selfish and cruel was that wish?  
  
"That you'll stay by my side until another happiness comes for you,
someday."  
  
A spell to make her, the sister, eventually abandon her.  
  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."  
  
Bery replied, not expecting a shred of another happiness.  
Yet, without hesitation, she answered Lazura as a sister.  
  
As she pulled away, she caressed Bery's cheek and gently traced her
lips.  
Just like her eyes, her lips always wove magical words.  
  
"Fufu, I've got your word. I won't allow you to go back on it."  
"Yes. ...I swear on this name."  
  
But no matter what her sister thought, this was a new contract they had
both sworn to.  
A promise, a challenge.  
  
If that time never came, Lazura lost.  
If that time came, Bery lost.  
  
And Lazura had never lost a serious match to her sister. 
<br /><br />

  
In the atelier she built herself, she groaned as she looked at her own
painting.  
A knock echoed.  
  
"Ojou-sama, would you like some tea for a break?"  
"............"  
  
She remained silent without answering, and the door opened and they
entered.  
There were two sets of footsteps, but she knew without looking that
there was one person and two animals.  
  
"Krische-sama, the cookies are over there."  
"Yes!"  
"Kreschenta-sama, shall we make tea together?"  
"...It's bothersome."  
"Kreschenta, no snacks for you."  
  
Looking at the entrance, Kreschenta, held by a redhead, pouted
unhappily, as if saying it couldn't be helped.  
She stood on two feet, reluctantly.  
Exaggerated, every time; this usually lazy former queen's mode of
transport was to be carried.  
If anything, it was rarer for her to walk on two feet.  
  
"...I didn't say you could come in. And what's with bringing two
idiots?"  
"Oh my, you're still sulking."  
"I'm not sulking!"  
  
When she glared, the redhead servant gave a wry smile.  
  
The big match that took place the day before yesterday.  
A sword duel in which their honor was at stake.  
Despite achieving victory through unimaginably despicable means, she
showed no sign of remorse.  
She truly was a woman with a twisted personality.  
What kind of upbringing would produce such a person?  
  
Nevertheless, despite all the complaints, a win was a win, and a loss
was a loss.  
And,  
  
*"The Head of the Household always said. A loss is a loss, whether by a
narrow margin or through foul play, and the loser has no room to object.
...A wonderful teaching, truly befitting a martial family."*  
*"That's so convenient! You weren't even a soldier in the first place!
And now I'm the Head, and you're just a servant!"*  
*"However, I am the Christand family's tutor. Forgive my presumption,
but I have been entrusted with the education of the Ojou-sama by the
Head of the Household and... Surely, you wouldn't disregard this just
because you have become the Head, would you—"*  
*"That's what I'm saying is unfair! You really are like, if I say this,
you say that...!*"  
  
She couldn't win a verbal argument like that.  
Bery Argan was the world's best at quibbling.  
If Selene had won, it would have been different, but having lost and
then having her father's teachings brought up, she couldn't complain.  
  
"You don't need to worry about it. I won, and the Ojou-sama lost. To put
it simply, that's all there is to it."  
"You really are annoying, you..."  
"Fortune favors the bold in battle... One cannot grow if one dwells on a
single defeat."  
"It's piled up like a mountain already—uuu!"  
"Quiet."  
  
Kreschenta, who had set down her teacup in exasperation, spoke and
pulled her cheek.  
Krische, who had been arranging chairs, tilted her head with an
unconcerned expression and smiled.  
It probably looked as if Selene and Bery were happily chatting.  
To her younger sister, they were surely just having fun talking about
things she didn't understand.  
  
"N...?!"  
  
Feeling inexplicably annoyed, she pinched both their cheeks.  
  
"No, you mustn't take it out on them."  
"...I want to pull your cheek so hard it never goes back to normal."  
"Ojou-sama, imagine yourself losing a match and then resorting to
violence against your opponent. Is that truly a sight you can be proud
of, in your own name?"  
"A-actually..."  
"Uuu... it hurts...!"  
"Fffh, hurtsh, hurtsh...!"  
  
She instinctively tightened her fingers pinching their cheeks and
exhaled in anger.  
The two, released from her grip, glared at Selene accusingly before
subtly putting some distance between them.  
  
"...What, do you have a complaint?"  
"Uuu..."  
"...I don't want to agree with the redhead, but that was clearly taking
it out on us."  
"Kreschenta-sama is right. Krische-sama, you poor thing, that must have
hurt."  
"Ehehe... yes. But if Krische gets pet, the pain might go away."  
  
Her cheek caressed, Krische immediately brightened.  
Kreschenta glanced unhappily at Bery, then nestled closer, letting her
cheek be stroked.  
Selene sighed again.  
  
"...So, what do you want?"  
"I was thinking we should decide on the destination for the underwater
sunken tour. As I mentioned, according to Krische-sama, there are
several large magic crystal caves in the Fasner Trench, so how about
exploring them while observing deep-sea creatures?"  
"...Do whatever you want. It's your win, so don't be considerate in a
strange way."  
"Are you still sulking, after all?"  
"I'm not sulking!"  
  
And so, while crunching on cookies, they discussed travel plans.  
  
The underwater sunken tour, as the name suggests, was a sightseeing trip
while sinking to the seabed.  
Unknown creatures lurking in the deep sea where light couldn't reach.  
It was a tour whose main purpose was to observe countless creatures
undiscovered on the other side and feel the mystery of life, and it was
particularly Bery's favorite.  
Elvena and Anne also seemed to be quite fond of it, and every time a new
species was found, whoever won the silly bet would give it an arbitrary
name, record it in an encyclopedia, and observe its ecology.  
The seabed seemed to be naturally rich in magic, with new creatures
being born and disappearing, and it was vast to begin with.  
They always got excited finding many new species each time they went,
but something still felt off.  
  
When presented with a magical projection of the magic crystal caves in
the Fasner Trench as a presentation, she was indeed intrigued, but the
place she most wanted to go was Clician.  
Located in the southeast of the Vinashiare Continent, opposite the
Alberan Continent (as it was now called), it was probably the largest
magic crystal cave on the planet.  
It was an artificial (or perhaps dragon-made) cave, painstakingly dug
over tens of thousands of years by the digging dragon Venasil, who
seemed to have recently arrived.  
The beauty of the magic crystals spread throughout the dragon's nest,
which had built a large mountain range around it with the excavated
earth and transformed the sea into land, must have been spectacular.  
Selene wanted to explore such a massive cave created by a peculiar
dragon (dragons were generally peculiar).  
Even though the magic crystal cave was introduced to appease Selene, she
still couldn't genuinely feel happy.  
  
Complaining and eating cookies.  
By the time Krische and Kreschenta, apparently full, fell asleep on the
sofa, her anger had somewhat subsided, and she resumed her painting.  
It was still in the sketching stage.  
  
"I thought it was a self-portrait, but perhaps it's Nee-sama?"  
  
Bery, who had put the two to sleep, peered over from beside her and
asked.  
  
"Yes. I thought I'd display it where you see it every day. I thought if
you saw Mother's face, you might reconsider your twisted heart and
perhaps become a little better."  
"Oh my. I don't intend to have a bad personality..."  
"You're so twisted it's beyond bad, honestly."  
  
She glared at Bery, who was shaking her shoulders happily with a
chuckle, and sighed.  
  
"But it's hard to remember clearly after so many years, even for me."  
"I feel like Kreschenta-sama would remember it accurately... She was
with the Head of the Household and Nee-sama at the capital ceremony, and
if she saw even from a distance, she'd probably draw it easily."  
"Maybe, but I kind of don't want to ask that idiot."  
  
When she asked, "How much do you remember?" Bery smiled and said, "Quite
clearly."  
She pursed her lips and continued, "Of course, it fades over time."  
  
"I see a living portrait of my sister almost every day."  
"...Am I that much alike?"  
"Yes. There are differences, like hair and eye color, or body type...
but the Ojou-sama is slenderer than Nee-sama and taller."  
  
She said, caressing Selene's cheek and turning her face towards
herself.  
  
"The contours are just a little fuller, the ears are a little lower, and
the earlobes are a bit thinner. Other than that, her eyes are a little
softer, perhaps... her nose and mouth are identical."  
  
Her long eyelashes framed her light brown eyes, as if reminiscing.  
As she spoke, she traced her lips with her thumb and gently, softly
kissed them.  
  
Her cheeks flushed involuntarily.  
Despite having a childlike face, Bery was sometimes irresistibly
sensual.  
  
"It's like... I really want to ask, and I really don't want to ask,
but..."  
"...?"  
"What was your relationship with Mother actually like? I mean, was it
more than just sisters...?"  
"Ah... fufu, it's certainly a difficult question to ask from your
position, isn't it?"  
  
Bery smiled, a little troubled, at the awkward question.  
  
Even as a child, she had thought they were quite close.  
Sleeping with Selene on Bery's lap, like a lap pillow, or pulling her
into bed like a hugging pillow, sitting on her lap, or the other way
around.  
The closeness to Krische was unavoidable given Krische's personality. In
fact, Selene herself was treated in a way that she couldn't really
comment on others, but her mother and Bery were sensible, good adults.  
While sometimes feeling jealous of their closeness, Selene hadn't
questioned it much at the time. But now, thinking about it as an adult,
their closeness seemed unnaturally strong.  
  
She had vaguely thought that's just how sisters were, but in that other
world, she had never once seen sisters who were that close, even when
they became old women.  
Of course, there might have been such sisters who simply didn't show it,
but their relationship was the kind that could easily lead to rumors.  
A love triangle between her father, mother, and Bery was entirely
plausible and not strange.  
Of course, her father never said anything, and she had seen him gazing
at the two of them with a smile many times.  
He probably didn't see it as a problem, but for Selene, who was on the
outside, it was a truly delicate topic.  
  
Did her father perceive them as just close sisters?  
Or did he tacitly approve of their relationship?  
  
It was a topic from the past—a relationship where there was no longer
any need for secrets between Bery and her.  
It wasn't to say "so what," nor did she want to indulge in unhealthy
fantasies like Anne's, but it was an indescribable topic that felt
subtly related to her own birth.  
It was the kind of content that she both wanted to hear and didn't want
to hear.  
  
"It's difficult to express in words. It might not be what you call a
normal sisterly relationship, but in a word, you could still call us
sisters... Yet, in some ways, we were closer than sworn lovers."  
"...R-right."  
"That's how it was for me, so I don't know what Nee-sama felt in her
heart... But, rest assured. It wasn't a relationship where we shared our
bare skin."  
  
Bery gently traced Selene's lips and said.  
  
"Nee-sama was married to the Head of the Household, and they exchanged
love as husband and wife, and Nee-sama and I exchanged love as
sisters... That's the nature of our love. In essence, it's a matter of
form."  
"Form..."  
"Whether you pour water, or plenty of honey, or even molten lead, a vase
is still a vase, isn't it?"  
"...But you were probably the molten lead, weren't you?"  
  
Bery was that kind of person.  
An affection too heavy and hot to pour into a vase.  
Somehow, that explained their relationship well.  
  
"Fufu, perhaps. But now it has cooled and solidified, and it has the
shape of a vase."  
  
—Even if the vase breaks, forever.  
Bery, having spoken, kissed Selene again.  
  
Light, yet surprisingly heavy, like human skin temperature, yet burning
hot.  
So soft that if pressed, it would melt.  
  
"Whatever the case, it's something from the past that can be enjoyed by
observing. ...And besides, there's a peculiar person now who says I can
pour as much lead as I like."  
"...I didn't say that. And you're the one who made that idiot there
peculiar, aren't you? I heard everything clearly."  
"Oh my. Eavesdropping must be a trait you inherited from Nee-sama."  
  
She chuckled, shaking her shoulders, and covered her mouth with her
hand.  
Bery smiled like a girl, then caressed her cheek again, and softly drew
her face close again.  
Her touching hand, her gaze, were hot.  
  
"A-actually... it's still daytime."  
"So it seems."  
  
Agreeing, without a hint of remorse.  
  
"...Honestly, what's going on in your head?"  
  
She sighed, her face flushed, calling her a worthless servant.  
  
Then, their touching noses slid past each other, overlapping. 
<br /><br />

  
Even if only partially, Lazura's feelings must have been conveyed.  
That too was a kind of match.  
Her sister cared for her more than she thought.  
Lazura won by making her feel that, and her sister lost as usual.  
  
Having lost the match, Bery then honorably spent her time by her side as
she had vowed.  
She began to smile naturally not only at Lazura but also at her
daughter, Selene, and similarly in front of Bogan.  
The weight on her emotions lifted just a little, allowing her to peek
out at the outside world with faint colors.  
She hadn't changed; rather, it was as if she had finally returned, after
a long detour, to that time when they were taking lessons together.  
  
Her demeanor had become much softer, and the townspeople would say so
when she went out shopping.  
Bery was originally a kind child.  
She had simply been confined by her body, environment, and various
things; from infancy, others were her focus.  
Her sister, who suffered emotionally from bothering others, was a person
who could rejoice in others' happiness as if it were her own.  
If only—for example, if she had maintained a good relationship with that
old teacher—such joy might have become confidence, and she might have
chosen her own path to be useful to many people.  
  
It was a little regrettable, but it was just a hypothetical.  
Since Lazura had been able to be so happy through a different turn of
events, it was just right to dream a little.  
  
Since being entrusted with Selene's education, she wore a troubled
expression that was happy every single day.  
Because she was entrusted with the education, she tried to interact with
people normally.  
Her attempts to overcome her weakness by nervously trying to make small
talk with shopkeepers were amusing.  
  
This sister's genuine effort was probably limited to such things.  
She could effortlessly do things that people had to work desperately to
achieve, yet small talk and everyday conversations were difficult
problems for her.  
When she would say something with a solemn face, like "It's good weather
today," and then blush when the conversation didn't continue, she was
quite foolish and cute.  
  
However, genuine feelings were conveyed.  
From such a sight, many things were sufficiently conveyed, and the other
party probably didn't feel bad.  
Gurgain was a peaceful town, and the residents had good dispositions.
They treated her sister well along with her daughter, and her tension
eased, becoming natural, and so did Selene.  
  
Children were mysterious.  
Perhaps it was also because she herself had been a very clever child,
but Bery, who had approached children timidly, seemed to realize that
children were rather simple and foolish, and she looked relieved.  
She would patiently indulge Selene's whims and smile while watching her
sleep.  
Selene also became very attached to her sister.  
  
Her sister, who could easily solve various problems, liked to worry
about others.  
Watching her struggle and experiment, trying to figure out how to solve
simple problems for Selene, was truly enjoyable, and Lazura genuinely
felt glad to be her older sister.  
For better or worse, perhaps because she placed no value on her own
talents, her condescending attitude was very natural, just like
rejoicing when a baby crawls or stands.  
No matter what she did, she must have been treated like a child her
whole life, always being told she did well.  
  
Selene was fine with that when she was truly a child, but children grow
up too.  
  
"What are you sulking about?"  
"...I'm not sulking."  
  
With an expression that clearly said she was sulking, eight-year-old
Selene was pouting and rolling around on the sofa.  
She denied it while openly showing her displeasure.  
This was a perfect example of how a silly child sulks.  
A child so cute it hurt her chest.  
  
"My, how cute... Could it be that Selene was born just to make her
mother happy?"  
"Mm-hmm..."  
"Fufu, you're so cute, your mother's going to squeal. Squeal, squeal."  
  
She hugged her, so adorable, and Selene's cheeks flushed unhappily.  
That made her even more lovable.  
  
An energetic child, just as Lazura wished.  
However, she was Bogan's child, overly energetic.  
She had inherited his blood perfectly, even to the point of imitating
his less desirable traits, like swinging Bogan's sword, which she
couldn't even hold.  
Moreover, she was stubborn and hated to lose.  
  
Because she was such a child, Bogan began to give her sword lessons as a
playful diversion, allowing her to swing a wooden sword. She would swing
it every day without getting bored.  
She showed enthusiasm, saying things like, "I'll follow in Father's
footsteps in the future," and Lazura thought she'd eventually get bored,
but in that regard, unlike the easily bored Lazura, she took after
Bogan.  
  
Bogan said she had talent, but whether she had talent or not, a mother
probably wouldn't want her child to go to the battlefield.  
While thinking that showing enthusiasm was a good thing, she wanted her
to focus on things other than the world of life and death.  
Regarding this, she had told Bery, who occasionally dealt with Selene in
place of the busy Bogan, to teach her the harsh realities. Was it good
or bad?  
  
Her aunt, who had only learned a little sword fighting from Bogan.  
Just hearing that, she seemed like an easily manageable opponent, but
because Selene set that genius Bery as her immediate goal, things got
subtly complicated.  
Selene was a stubborn hard worker who went straight ahead once she
decided something.  
She would never give up, no matter how many times she lost; instead, she
would get motivated and bravely challenge.  
And Bery, without ill intent, would play with the child.  
It was more like praising an energetic child's stick-waving than actual
training.  
  
Since she had told Bery to teach Selene about harsh reality, Lazura
found it difficult to say anything about Bery adding fuel to the fire.  
Selene, who she thought would eventually give up, turned out to be more
stubborn than imagined, so Lazura could only watch the fire turn into a
flame.  
  
Selene, who confidently challenged and lost against adults, even if they
were new recruits, and then desperately practiced again, was truly
Bogan's child.  
Yesterday, she was confident that she had gotten a point from the
instructor. Today she was making a fuss from the morning to come spar
with her later, but she was defeated thoroughly while being praised as
"very good, very good" as usual, and that's why she was sulking.  
  
"...I thought I could do it today."  
"The world is surprisingly vast, Selene. It doesn't matter whether your
sword is strong or weak."  
"It does matter! Bery doesn't even practice much, but..."  
"Oh, my little queen. I told you before, there are many things more
important than that. In this world... Mother's recommendation is to
indulge Bery a lot."  
  
She held up a finger while Selene sat on her lap.  
  
"I'm not as strong as that child, and I'm not good at studying, but
she'll do anything if I ask her. If a time comes when I have to fight
with a sword, Bery will protect me, and Bery usually takes care of
troublesome problems."  
"...I want to become stronger, follow in Father's footsteps, and be able
to protect Mother and everyone."  
"We're not gods, so we can't do everything alone just because we want
to. Even gods have their strengths and weaknesses."  
  
"You're silly," Lazura laughed.  
  
"Even gods rely on each other for what they can't do alone. We're weaker
humans, so don't you think it's even more so? It's best to try your best
within your limits, help each other when you're in trouble, and enjoy
tea together."  
"...I don't care if I lose in everything else, but I really want to win
at swordsmanship."  
"Fufu, that's what's childish about you. If your mother got serious, she
wouldn't lose to that child in any competition."  
"...Can Mother win even with a sword?"  
"It wouldn't even be close. If I ask her to lose, Bery will lose."  
  
Selene glared at Lazura silently.  
Lazura laughed, squeezing Selene's sulky, puffed-out cheeks with both
hands.  
  
"Perhaps this is the magical winning strategy that will let Selene
easily beat Bery."  
"...Absolutely not. I want to win fair and square."  
"You'll never beat Bery as long as you say things like that. In a match,
winning is all that matters, and how you win is just a bonus, a bonus.
Bogan says so too, doesn't he?"  
"Father doesn't say that much."  
  
She chuckled, shaking her shoulders and stroking Selene's head.  
  
"You might not understand yet, Selene, but there are some matches in
life that you absolutely must not lose. Not just on the battlefield, but
perhaps battles where you stake something far more important than your
own life."  
"...Does Mother have those too?"  
"Of course. For example, wishing that Selene grows up healthy and happy,
or that she has wonderful encounters."  
  
Pressing her cheek against the small head, she played with the long
hair.  
The long hair her sister had once cut off.  
The long hair Lazura had made her cut off.  
  
"So I'll definitely win the next match too, and I'll use anything and
everything to achieve victory regardless of appearance. ...What's truly
important is not losing in the truly important matches."  
  
—*Everything else doesn't matter*, she closed her eyes.  
  
Lazura was probably greedy.  
Thinking of making an already happy life even happier.  
  
As Selene grew older, she became more competitive towards her sister.  
Lazura was a little uneasy about that turning into an inferiority
complex or negative emotions, but it wasn't a major problem.  
Even when she got stubborn, Selene still loved Bery as before and was a
sensible, good child.  
Lazura felt confident that as long as she watched over them, everything
would be fine, yet she still pursued further happiness.  
  
It had been a little difficult when Selene was born.  
So, Bogan and Lazura had thought about it only if she could get pregnant
naturally, but day by day, Lazura began to feel that it would be good
for Selene to have someone like Bery.  
It would surely be fun.  
Childish Selene making a knowing face and saying, "You're still just a
child," or acting like an older sister to that child, and watching that
while laughing with Bery and Bogan.  
Bogan initially showed some reluctance, worrying about Lazura's health,
but he seemed to feel the same way and eventually agreed.  
  
She thought it would be enough if she could give birth to one healthy
child.  
But perhaps this was punishment for her greed.  
She was happy when she became pregnant, and full of anticipation as the
child grew.  
  
"Ah..."  
"...Nee-sama."  
  
On the bed.  
Perhaps lacking blood, her head felt hazy.  
Her body had no strength, and her senses were dull.  
  
Fragmented memories.  
She woke up several times, falling asleep each time, but her body didn't
seem to recover.  
  
A water pitcher by her mouth.  
Honey-flavored water was gently poured in, and she drank a little at a
time.  
  
"The baby... it didn't make it after all?"  
"No, that's not... she's in the next room now—"  
"...You silly fool. Are you going to lie to your Onee-sama?"  
  
Her vision was blurry and unclear.  
But she understood the voice perfectly, and she could tell whether it
was a lie just by listening.  
Vaguely, she had heard that the child hadn't made it.  
It was just a shame it wasn't a dream.  
  
"I've done a bad thing."  
"Nee-sama..."  
"Are the two of them...?"  
"It's been about three days since then. The Ojou-sama seems exhausted
from crying... I carried her to her room. The Head of the Household
should be returning soon."  
  
Bogan had left on an expedition that doubled as a bandit subjugation,
arriving earlier than planned.  
"Hand," she said, and her right hand was grasped.  
She felt almost nothing, but it was warm.  
  
"I'll probably die."  
"Nee-sama—"  
"So, listen."  
  
She felt a tight squeeze, and then, after a moment, she heard a "Yes."  
  
"I'll make that child lonely. Please take care of her for me."  
"...Yes. Nee-sama."  
"You too, but you try a little too hard... I'm worried."  
  
"Yes," she replied, and a cheek pressed against her hand.  
Perhaps it was wet, and slowly moving.  
  
Lazura was probably just an ordinary person after all.  
"I'll try my best" resulted in this; it couldn't be managed with just
feelings or determination.  
She had always lived supported, leaned on.  
Half-baked Lazura, after all, couldn't fight alone.  
  
But Lazura had an exceptionally talented other half.  
She had a kind sister who would lose if she asked.  
A child who couldn't be without Lazura, just as Lazura couldn't be
without her.  
The best other half in the world, on whom she had cast many such
charms.  
  
"...I will definitely win this match."  
"...?"  
  
Even if Lazura died, her sister would always be by her side.  
She would keep her promises.  
No matter what happened, she would surely watch over Selene properly.  
Until Selene could truly be happy.  
Bery was a sister who, despite being betrayed, would not break her
contract with Lazura.  
  
"No matter who I lose to, I will never, not once, lose to you."  
  
Lazura was not particularly strong, but she had such a sister by her
side.  
She had a sister who loved her more than anyone, and that alone made her
stronger than anyone.  
And her sister, who was excellent enough for two, would grant Lazura any
wish.  
  
She traced the contour of her cheek and touched her soft lips.  
Tracing and tickling, again and again.  
Casting the charm many times.  
  
She never granted her sister's wishes, not once.  
A sister who wouldn't accept her, yet forced her to stay by her side.  
Casting many curse-like charms, binding her, keeping her by her side.  
A charm, containing a fervent prayer to break any evil, and that Lazura
would be forgiven.  
  
A charm that she would never forget Lazura, from now on, forever.  
A charm that she would forget Lazura, someday in the future.  
  
A charm that she would be happy enough for Lazura's share.  
A charm that she would be happy enough to forget.  
  
A charm that she would meet a wonderful person.  
A charm that she would love more than Lazura.  
  
"...This is that kind of charm."  
  
Lazura was probably a wicked witch.  
But she wanted to put a wonderful prayer into it, at least at the end.  
  
Just as she did as a child, with a pure heart.  
Earnestly wishing for her sister's future and happiness, from the very
depths of her being.  
  
Someday, she would surely be happier than anyone.  
To where even the half that rejected her would feel like a fateful
encounter.  
  
Wishing it would be so.  
  
—This was that kind of charm. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
On the bed in the dark room, where only moonlight streamed in.  
The redhead girl held the silver-haired girl on her lap, and spoke, "And
I..."  
  
"—...I hope that you'll continue to stay with me like this, forever."  
  
Words of a wish, once spun and then vanished.  
Words of a curse, as if overflowing involuntarily from the gaps in the
sealed weight.  
She lowered her eyes as she spoke, as if bewildered, as if afraid.  
  
She probably didn't even understand the deep meaning.  
The silver-haired girl still sat up and settled on her lap.  
She quietly showed a purplish hue, like the onset of dusk, in her
twilight-colored eyes, and kissed her, responding happily.  
  
"...Krische wants to be with Bery forever too."  
  
No matter what her intention in answering, it was a contract.  
Undoubtedly, a sworn promise made with a foolish girl.  
She cupped the innocent girl's cheeks with both hands, trapping her in
the twilight with her magical eyes.  
The redhead girl gave a deep, deep kiss that melted and merged them
together.  
  
Even when the day ends, so they wouldn't leave, couldn't leave.  
With a wish like a curse.  
  
—This was that kind of charm.
