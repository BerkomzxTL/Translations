## Chapter 354: Krische's Krische – Night

Breakfast is usually prepared by two people.  
Lunch preparation varies, and dinner is usually made by three.  
Selene occasionally participates to kill time, but today was as usual.  
  
Kreschenta is silly, spoiled, sloppy, and a clingy person who can't be
straightforward, but she's quite good at cooking.  
Her complaints and bad temper never decrease, but she's serious and
meticulous in her work.  
She seems to like cooking, despite her grumbling, and she always
completes her tasks responsibly.  
  
"Letting them do it is important" (from Bery's sayings) was also a quote
from Skeleton's sayings.  
It was used when Keith was entrusted with the equivalent of an
Adjutant's job, a suggestion from Mia.  
Giving responsibility and being recognized for meeting expectations
boosts motivation and encourages growth.  
The tension when Bery entrusts the menu to Krische, and the joy of
taking that small step and meeting expectations, were hard to put into
words.  
  
She was an impossible sister, but she was truly Krische's sister.  
Kreschenta, when entrusted with work by Bery, works hard despite her
grumbling and sometimes produces results that even impress Krische.  
The carved pumpkin bowl Kreschenta held was a masterpiece born from her
enthusiasm.  
  
The sky was lit by stars and moon.  
Opening the spatially fixed door in the hollow, with a covered pumpkin
and a basket in hand, revealed two dragons.  
Lira sat alone at the roots just before them.  
Around the towering world tree, countless lights—silly spirits—emitted a
faint phosphorescence, swimming, fluttering, and darting here and there,
while at their feet, they hopped and skipped about.  
Seeing the spirits, Krische somehow recalled the children she saw at
Mia's dojo.  
  
Krische doesn't understand what's so interesting about this scenery.  
Bery once said she was enjoying making memories.  
At the time, Krische didn't fully understand, and she still isn't sure
if she understands completely now, but what Bery meant by "enjoyment"
was probably something like this.  
  
When exposed to similar things or situations, memories unexpectedly
surface.  
Remembering the children fighting over the few cookies they brought,
recalling all the trouble they caused… even those memories seem
enjoyable in retrospect.  
It's strange, but that's probably how it is.  
  
Krische has no memories she can't recall.  
But unexpectedly surfacing memories are much more enjoyable than simply
recalling them, and Bery's memories were probably the same, she now
vaguely understands.  
  
Krische can feel this way because Bery tries so hard to create many
memories.  
Every time she recalls an insignificant memory, she feels happy
reflecting on the little things from their travels.  
  
Using magic to shoo away a troublesome wind spirit trying to lift her
skirt, she headed to Lira.  
  
"K-Krische-sama…"  
  
Lira, noticing her, turned around in her usual attire, covering only her
chest and waist.  
Kre'Sharana was a gathering of people who liked revealing clothing.  
Krische was taught from childhood that showing thighs and stomach was
indecent, and she continued to believe so even after moving to the
city.  
Since Bery, the epitome of a lady, prefers such attire, Krische also
prefers it, but in Kre'Sharana, fluttering clothing is apparently
indecent.  
  
Common sense is complicated.  
However, if Bery had grown up in a culture where revealing clothes were
preferred like Lira's, Krische might have easily adopted that culture.  
Considering that, it seems understandable.  
  
"Looking at things from various angles" is also a teaching of Bery's.  
While it was understandable in the heat, Krische thought Lira should
wear more comfortable clothing in the cold, but she hasn't said anything
about it.  
  
"Ehehe, Krische brought pumpkin gratin for Lira too."  
"I'm, uh, currently in training…"  
"Yes. Krische knew you were in training, but Krische made some for you
anyway. Krische thought it would be perfect for a break."  
"A-a break…"  
  
Krische nodded.  
  
"You've been enduring for about a year now, so Krische thinks the
perfect time to enjoy it has arrived. What do you think?"  
  
Opening the lid revealed a rich pumpkin aroma.  
Lira purred, gazing intently at the gratin.  
  
"This pumpkin gratin is the best pumpkin gratin Bery painstakingly made
for Krische. That's why Krische wanted Lira to try it too."  
"F-for me…?"  
"Yes, if Lira’s only been eating nuts and wild vegetables, Lira, this
will surely move you."  
  
Lira was, among the people in the mansion, the biggest foodie.  
However, because she sometimes forgets the value of food, she has a
hobby of regularly undergoing self-imposed training.  
Her training includes things like abstaining from delicious food or
sleeping outdoors instead of on a soft bed.  
The appeal, apparently, is that enduring deprivation enhances the joy of
its end.  
Her relaxed appearance after breaking her fast in the mansion is truly
indescribably happy.  
  
If Krische had lived like Lira, and then eaten Bery's cooking… just
imagining it makes her mouth water.  
  
The first time Krische, after leaving the village, tasted Bery's
cooking, it was a world-altering shock.  
However, she doesn't have the confidence to push herself to that extent
again to experience that same feeling.  
Considering this, Lira, who works so hard just to eat delicious food, is
an overwhelming gourmand compared to Krische.  
Krische even feels a certain degree of respect for her dedication to
food.  
  
Elvena, who happened to appear in the kitchen, offered to help, and as a
result, another pumpkin gratin was made.  
It's a good opportunity. Today's pumpkin gratin is exquisite, the
ultimate delicacy that rewards Lira's efforts.  
  
Krische handed Lira a pumpkin and a spoon, who then scooped up some
gratin with trembling hands.  
She cautiously took a bite, savored it, closed her eyes, and…  
  
"Lira?"  
  
Tears silently roll down her closed eyelids.  
  
"It's… delicious. So delicious…"  
  
She cleared her throat, gazed blankly at the sky, wiped her eyes, and
looked at the gratin again.  
Tears of joy—this is what being overwhelmed feels like.  
Krische had experienced this, but never from just eating food.  
Smiling, Krische figured she must have been enduring a lot and showed
her the basket of bread.  
  
"Krische also brought some bread, would you like some? Ehehe,  it's
freshly baked."  
  
Lira nodded and timidly picked up a piece of bread, biting into it.  
She ate the gratin and then bread, becoming completely engrossed.  
The first piece of bread disappeared quickly into Lira's stomach.  
  
"You can eat as much as you want. Your break… um, ah, that's right.
Tomorrow, let's have a skewer party with Lira's favorite meat!"  
"T-that's…"  
"It's okay. Lira’s endured for a year, so it's alright to indulge a
little. It'll be super delicious."  
"J-just a little…"  
"Yes, no one will get mad if you skip training for a bit… right,
Regalave-san?"  
  
She asked, and Regalave looked at her with large eyes, his magical power
crackling.  
  
『What do you ask me for? Eat as much as you like.』  
"See, even Regalave-san says so."  
"R-Regalave-sama also…"  
"Yes. If Lira really wants to continue your training, Krische won't
force you… but deprivation is bad for your body, and overdoing it isn't
good. It's okay to take a small break."  
  
Lira stared at the bread and pumpkin for a while, then said, "W-well,
refusing would… b-be bad."  
She nodded with eyes filled with desire. 
<br /><br />

  
And so, after parting with Lira, she returned to the mansion.  
Elvena was just feeding Gururun in the garden.  
  
"Welcome back. How was it?"  
"Ehehe, Krische’s thinking of having Lira's favorite meat skewers
tomorrow."  
"Is that so? Fufu, that's wonderful."  
"Yes, thanks to Elvena."  
  
Elvena smiled happily and patted Krische's head.  
  
Krische may be the deputy head servant, but Elvena is quite something.  
While she doesn't match Krische or Bery in terms of ability, Krische
marvels at her ability to understand people's feelings and subtly take
care of them.  
  
"Did you know about Lira's pumpkin and prepare it?"  
"Of course not. Krische-sama and the others seemed so happy, so I
just…"  
  
Elvena said that with a smile, and Krische nodded.  
  
"Either way, it's thanks to Elvena. Krische thinks Lira has been
depriving herself a bit too much, even if it's for the sake of delicious
food. And Krische thinks that Elvena's worry and consideration were
conveyed to Lira."  
"Is that so… I sometimes worry that I'm getting in the way."  
"It's alright. Sincerity and kindness are always conveyed eventually."  
  
Quoting Bery's sayings, Krische nodded repeatedly.  
Elvena was a bit mischievous, but a kind and considerate person.  
  
"Ability is just a bonus" (from Bery's sayings), the way of a servant is
not about what they did, but what they thought when they did it.  
Observing others closely, showing subtle care, and giving small
happiness to others – that was the root of being a servant, and Elvena
understood it well.  
  
Even if unintentional, her actions may have been an unconscious act of
care for Lira.  
Elvena usually denies such things, but it's probably humility.  
Not boasting about one's achievements is also part of being a servant.  
Such things only need to be understood by those who understand.  
Without dwelling on it, Krische said,  
  
"You can rest when you're done taking care of Gururun, Elvena."  
  
"Yes. Oh… that's right."  
"…? "  
  
As if remembering something, Elvena showed her a pot on the shelf in
Gururun's shed.  
Krische tilted her head, opened the lid, and the smell of alcohol wafted
out.  
  
"…Alcohol?"  
"Yes. I think it's something like monkey wine…"  
"Monkey wine…"  
  
It's said to be alcohol that is made naturally when animals store fruit
and other things.  
But that's just a convenient explanation.  
In most cases, it's just a hidden stash of alcohol, or alcohol made
secretly under that guise, is the common view.  
  
"It seems the spirits near the farm saw Krische-sama and the others
making wine and tried to imitate it. More than monkey wine… it seems
they were enjoying making alcohol in the forest."  
"Krische understands…"  
  
Spirits were truly silly creatures.  
They were like Kreschenta when she's not thinking, living without deep
thought in the moment.  
There was nothing strange about them gathering fruit from the field and
making alcohol on their own.  
  
"So I thought I should get Krische-sama's confirmation."  
"C-confirmation…"  
"Yes, confirmation."  
  
Elvena said with a smile, and Krische's eyes darted around.  
  
"B-but, Elvena, Selene has been getting angry about the alcohol ban
lately…"  
"Of course, I understand. If you say it should be returned, I was
thinking of doing so, but I thought I should get Krische-sama's judgment
first…"  
"I-Indeed…"  
  
Inhaling the smell of alcohol, Krische looked inside the pot.  
The impurities had been removed, and it wasclear—it looked like it could
be drunk as is.  
  
"I took a small sip, and it's quite a smooth and good drink."  
"Smooth…"  
"Yes. Of course, I'm not recommending drinking it, but I thought you
should at least check it, so I brought it… should I return it?"  
  
Krische shook her head in a panic when Elvena asked.  
  
"Th-that's… n-no, it's not like that. Y-yes, confirmation is
important."  
"Understood. You'll probably be taking a bath soon, shall I leave it in
your room?"  
"Y-yes… as the head servant, I also need to get Bery's confirmation."  
"Yes, yes. …Between you and me, there are actually other alcohols I'd
like you to confirm."  
  
Elvena leaned in to whisper.  
  
"The spirits seem to be making alcohol in several groups. Each is
different… if Krische-sama wishes, I can bring them to you at a later
date for confirmation."  
"Later…"  
"Yes. Anytime."  
  
Elvena smileed, bowed, and left.  
Krische, her cheeks flushed from the alcohol, looked at Gururun.  
  
"T-this is… important confirmation, important work for a servant."  
  
Whether Gururun understood or not, Krische muttered.  
Gururun made a disinterested "Gururu," and yawned. 
<br /><br />

  
Bathing is a very important daily routine for Krische.  
Waking up early in the morning, putting on her apron dress, she works
without a moment's rest. Removing the fatigue so it doesn't linger into
the next day was an important time of rest.  
This was true for Krische, but even more so for Bery.  
Krische, though still immature, always relies on Bery, who always
pampers her.  
It's a precious time to repay Bery, who never falters as a servant.  
  
"It's presumptuous of you to wash my hair, you redhead."  
"Fufu, I apologize."  
  
Even the sloppy Kreschenta, usually lounging around, cooperates this
time, muttering and grumbling as always, but washing meticulously.  
"They can do it if they put their minds to it" is something Krische
often heard at Mia's dojo.  
Kreschenta truly embodies this.  
Her actions of washing Bery's hair with lather were impeccable.  
  
If Kreschenta washes Bery's hair, Krische washes her body.  
Lathering it thoroughly, like caressing silk.  
Cleaning with utmost care, meticulously starting from her fingertips.  
  
Every time she touches her, Krische thinks that Bery's body is so
pleasant to the touch.  
Firm yet soft and bouncy, yielding gently to the touch.  
A suppleness possessed only by those who use no unnecessary force.  
Kreschenta – and Krische herself, probably – has a modest chest and
hips.  
Unlike Krische, who is not very well-built, Bery is big all over.  
If compared to a chicken, it's the difference between a wing and a
thigh.  
  
Krische doesn't dislike wings, but her favorite is still the juicy,
meaty thigh, something she wants to bite into.  
Bery's body is like a thigh, possessing all the qualities Krische
seeks.  
Kreschenta seems to agree, as she loves hugging Bery.  
Being able to become the ultimate cushion is a quality of a first-rate
servant.  
  
And it's not just about body build, Bery's hugging style is also
excellent.  
When hugged, she's guided naturally to a comfortable position, and her
center of gravity is stable.  
The feeling is so comfortable that she could fall asleep easily.  
She adjusts subtly to any movement, making the hug comfortable even if
the position is a little awkward for the hugger.  
  
Admirable spirit of service.  
However, such small accumulations of fatigue add up.  
In this bath, Krische serves to undo Bery's mental apron dress – that is
the duty of the deputy head servant.  
  
"Ehehe, does it feel good?"  
"Y-yes, very..."  
  
Krische loved being washed by Bery and found it very comfortable, but
Bery seemed to dislike it somewhat, always making a slightly embarrassed
face.  
Krische tried various methods, wondering if the washing technique was
the problem, but that wasn't it; Bery was a lady even in such
situations.  
She's shy about showing her skin; a shy Ojou-sama.  
  
Excellent touch, excellent cushioning, supple yet resilient—a body
naturally suited for service.  
For Krische, there's nothing shameful about Bery's naked body, but her
shyness probably stems from the idea that a lady shouldn't show her
skin.  
It's strange that she sometimes isn't shy; Krische theorizes the
difference lies in whether or not she's mentally wearing an apron
dress.  
  
Bery is a servant, and a servant is Bery.  
To Bery service comes first.  
In her daily life, from waking to sleeping, Bery lives as a servant.  
Even naked, she's a servant, and the situation of being served makes her
uneasy.  
  
She even feels shame at being served—such a servant's spirit.  
It's admirable, truly impressive—Krische respects Bery. However, it's
not right.  
As the saying goes, "Even Bery needs rest" (quoted from Bery's sayings),
Bery needs time to take off her mental apron dress and rest.  
And Krische's most important role is to serve Bery in that regard.  
  
Krische covered Bery's entire body in bubbles, straddled her knees, and
gazed intently at her. Bery's eyes wandered.  
Krische kissed her three times.  
Bery's body tensed slightly, then she gently pushed Krische away.  
  
In her eyes was a hint of anger, of reproach.  
Beyond the apron dress's metaphorical belt, naked Bery's face peeked
out, then quickly vanished.  
  
"I-I can finish washing myself, it's alright."  
  
At those words, her gaze wavering, Krische smiled and nodded in
agreement.  
  
Bery said that Selene and Kreschenta are similar.  
Not just in their ways of being spoiled, but also in their clear
expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.  
Unlike Kreschenta, whose thoughts Krische can understand easily due to
their similar way of thinking, it's not as easy to know what Selene is
thinking, but Selene is still relatively easy to read.  
Her emotions are clearly displayed on her face.  
  
Bery, on the other hand, is the opposite.  
  
Anne and Lira are more like Selene; Elvena is a bit more like Bery.  
There's a slight pause before their emotions show on their faces.  
This isn't always the case, but Krische thinks their thought processes
are a bit different.  
  
If Selene is clear soup, Bery is like a pie-covered, invisible soup.  
Covered in a fragrant pie crust, its contents are hidden, only the
outside is visible.  
You might think it's onion soup, but it could be a gratin; you can't
imagine what it is until you cut it open.  
All you know is that it's delicious.  
  
A pie crust that would easily crumble with a spoon always covers Bery.  
  
When she soaks in the bath and leans against Bery, she's enveloped in
support.  
Sometimes, however, Bery gently pushes Krische away.  
Bery is the adult, Krische the child.  
Always one step ahead of Krische.  
  
Of course, Krische finds Bery beautiful, but Bery is a servant.  
Even if it's true for everyone else, taking care of Bery is Krische's
job.  
Krische wants to be spoiled by Bery, just as she spoils Bery.  
  
After leaving the bathroom and changing into pajamas, Krische called out
to Anne and went to the kitchen.  
Elvena had already taken the cookies prepared for Selene.  
After taking the cookies to their room, Bery and Kreschenta immediately
noticed the jar on the shelf.  
Where the wine for nightcaps usually was (currently under Selene's
management), the jar sat proudly.  
  
"That is..."  
"...it faintly smells of alcohol."  
"That's right. This is..."  
  
Krische explained what Elvena had just told her, placing it on the
table.  
Kreschenta placed the wine glasses, likely brought by Elvena, next to
it.  
Bery blushed, sighing as she looked at Krische and Kreschenta.  
  
"...Oh dear. We'll be scolded by the Ojou-sama again?"  
"Ehehe, but it was made by a spirit, and Krische thinks it should be
checked."  
"I think Elvena probably had it made, though."  
"...? Is that so?"  
"There's no proof...but she's mischievous, like a spirit."  
  
Bery chuckled, sat on the sofa, and poured the contents of the jar into
the wine glasses.  
Thanks to magic, it glowed faintly amber.  
  
"...Beautiful."  
  
Bery murmured, and Krische smiled, looking at Bery's profile.  
  
"I thought it would be difficult to make them do complex things, but
they're surprisingly capable."  
"Spirits are more intelligent now than when they first appeared. Even if
clumsy, they can use magic, and with a little training, they can
probably do tasks like this."  
"Fufu, let's try various things next time."  
  
Bery said, placing a wine glass in front of each of them.  
They clinked glasses, tasted it, and then drank.  
  
It was as refreshing and easy to drink as she said.  
The alcohol content was low, like juice.  
Unlike Krische and the others, whose work was mostly manual aside from
temperature control, it was likely brewed using magic.  
The sweetness and sourness of various fruits blended together and flowed
smoothly down their throats.  
  
"It's an easy-drinking alcohol. It seems like something Krische-sama and
the others would like."  
"Yes! It's incredibly delicious!"  
  
As Krische reached for the jar, Bery quickly moved it away.  
  
"No. It's officially forbidden... today is just a taste test."  
"...No more?"  
"E-even if you look at me like that..."  
  
When Krische stared intently at her, Bery avoided eye contact.  
Krische glanced at Kreschenta, who, upon understanding, snatched the jar
and poured herself some.  
  
"What do you think you're doing, a mere servant? Bery, the master of
this place isn't Selene-sama, but the great queen who created this
world, myself and Onee-sama. If the master wants to drink, it's the duty
of a subject to provide it."  
"I think it's also the duty of a subject to advise a master who is about
to go down a bad path..."  
  
Bery laughed in a troubled way while Kreschenta thrusted the jar at
her.  
  
"Unfortunately, I don't need the words of incompetent people like you.
I'd rather hear the caw of a crow. ...Can't you drink your master's
brew?"  
"...Oh dear."  
  
She tilted her glass, drained the amber liquid, and let out a breath
with heated passion.  
Then she held out her glass, and Kreschenta cheerfully poured her
more.  
  
"Don't blame me if we get scolded."  
"I have no reason to be scolded."  
"Well..."  
  
They said that, chuckling.  
Krische also held out her glass to be filled.  
  
"...Krische-sama, you're a bad girl too."  
  
Bery whispered in her ear, in a tone that made Krische's heart pound.  
Krische blushed slightly and quietly replied, "Yes."  
  
Bery's voice, sweet yet prickly.  
A faint scent of honey mingled with alcohol, a strange fragrance.  
Deep within the crumbled pie, a Bery who wasn't a servant peeked out
just slightly.  
  
Kreschenta and Krische took turns pouring the alcohol; Bery’s cheeks
were lightly flushed.  
While Krische and Kreschenta weren't strong drinkers, Bery was quite
capable.  
They poured just the right amount, initially scolding each other, but
eventually that stopped.  
  
Bery's gaze would occasionally turn towards them, full of reproach.  
Angry, light brown eyes.  
A gaze like a fiery sunset, burning Krische's face.  
The colour of bubbling emotions within her usually hidden self.  
  
Bery was always the adult, always the servant.  
Unlike Selene, she doesn't get angry or reproach—she only expresses joy
and pleasure.  
  
But as Bery once said, everyone is human.  
Her heart was a soup, made with the same ingredients as everyone else,
she just doesn't show it.  
She just endures until it overflows.  
  
Bery is always a servant.  
Someone who doesn’t spend time on herself.  
That’s why Krische uses her time to serve her.  
  
Like crumbling a pie with a spoon and stirring the soup inside.  
Making the unangry Bery angry; being a bad girl is Krische's job.  
  
They kissed, taking turns with her sister, exchanging bad kisses.  
Tasting and savoring the wine on their tongues, when Bery pinched
Krische's cheeks and pulled away.  
  
"It's Krische-sama's fault."  
  
To those words, Krische replied, "Yes."  
Hearing Bery's childish excuse, she smiled.  
  
"...Ehehe, it's Krische's fault."  
  
Krische replied as usual.  
  
Bery's most cunning trait was giving Krische an excuse to lose.  
Bery's most kind trait was giving in even if Krische loses.  
  
In the end, Bery always gives in and pretends to be angry at the foolish
Krische.  
She closes the distance from her position one step ahead, coming to the
same place.  
  
Bery pushed Krische down on the sofa and said in an angry tone,  
  
"For a bad Krische-sama, I must give you punishment."  
  
Krische laughed at those words, remembering Selene at noon.  
  
"...?"  
"Selene said something similar at noon."  
  
Bery blushed even more and then sighed.  
  
"Don't say things like that."  
  
She kissed Krische, scolding her.  
  
And so, Krische reaches the end of her day.  
Today, tomorrow, and the day after, Krische is an immature servant.  
Spoiled and unable to catch up, she goes round and round in the same
place, repeating the same things.  
In the mansion Bery painted, she clings to Bery day after day, receiving
everything.  
Bery says it's alright, and always spoils Krische.  
  
"When did Krische-sama become such a bad girl?"  
  
That's why, in the familiar world Bery painted, Krische tugs on her
sleeve and is selfish.  
She troubles and angers the kind Bery, and at night, she takes off the
world's best apron dress.  
  
"I've always been a bad girl."  
  
The Krische Krische desires is that Krische.  
  
"...The Krische now is the Krische Bery and Krische found."  
  
The Krische Bery desired, that Krische.  
  
A slightly cunning and bad girl, that Krische will always be Krische's
Krische.
