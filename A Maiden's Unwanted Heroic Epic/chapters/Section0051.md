## Chapter 361: Far, Far in the Future IV

"…I'm not satisfied at all."  
"Now, now… Kreschenta-sama, it's just a game, isn't it?"  
  
This was the villa known as Mansion Annex Two.  
They preferred the old ways, doing everything by hand, but they still
had a considerable interest in the advancements of the times.  
The other world, while repeating progress and decline, had produced
various inventions. To ignore all of them and continue living as in
olden times would be unhealthy.  
  
However, adopting these inventions indiscriminately could mean
abandoning their beloved old way of life—so they came up with Mansion
Annex Two.  
Mansion Main Hall, where they usually lived, maintained their
traditional lifestyle.  
But in Annex Two, they indulged in the progress of humanity by freely
and actively adopting inventions from the other world.  
  
Not to mention inventions like washing machines and vacuum cleaners, the
vast garden was paved and transformed into a circuit.  
Cars, motorcycles, drones, and aeroboards that flew through the air were
lined up, and occasionally, the Mansion Grand Prix, enjoyable even for
Gururun, was held.  
Inside the mansion, all sorts of entertainment computing devices
gathered from around the world were installed, making it more accurate
to call it a large entertainment facility than a mansion.  
  
In the Third Entertainment Room of Mansion Annex Two.  
Projected in the center of the room was the game screen of *Forgotten
Alberan 7*, the latest installment in the strategic simulation *Alberan
War Chronicles* series.  
It was a hardcore game set in that era, renowned for its simplified yet
realistic in-game economy.  
On the battlefield, every single soldier was controlled, offering a game
experience tailored to the player's style, from a single soldier on the
battlefield to a commander or ruler.  
This series seemed to have continued for about two thousand years, and
this company had released several other games recreating that era's
world.  
  
The ancient queen Kreschenta (the real one), dressed in a white
one-piece dress, sat atop her red-haired servant, gripping the
controller unhappily.  
  
She glared at the ancient queen Kreschenta (the fake one) displayed on
the screen.  
To be precise, she frowned as she gazed at the displayed ability
scores.  
  
"No matter how I think about it, my abilities are far too low compared
to Uncle's. My political ability is even approaching Selene-sama's. How
on earth could they have come up with that?"  
"...You're really rude, you know. Well, it's true, I also feel like I'm
overestimated in many ways... but on the other hand, Father is a bit
underestimated."  
  
Selene was sitting next to her, also gripping a controller, and spoke
with a slight hint of dissatisfaction.  
  
"It was a long, long time ago, so it can't be helped. Those from that
era who were splendid warriors, like Margrave Agrand and Margrave
Velraigh, seem to be properly evaluated... In fact, I'd say more than
imagined. Look, there are even anecdotes compiled for each of them... If
anything, it's quite impressive."  
"...There's an anecdote I have absolutely no memory of. Like cutting
down assassins while in a wheelchair even in her later years... What
kind of situation is that?"  
"Fufu, that's history for you."  
  
Bery chuckled, her shoulders shaking with amusement.  
  
"I used to have some resistance to it, but... after so many years, that
feeling has considerably faded. After all, the people depicted here are
how people of the present age imagine those of that time; it's natural
that they're different from their actual selves."  
"Well, that's true... there's a sense of 'it's too late now,' isn't
there? That drama the other day even had you as the evil mastermind, and
I couldn't help but laugh... In a way, it wasn't wrong."  
"That was quite a novel approach... with Krische-sama also being a magic
doll I created."  
  
She gave a wry smile and rubbed her cheek against Krische's head, who
was clinging to her left arm, asleep.  
  
"However... considering it was 15,000 years ago, it feels almost too
accurate."  
"Too accurate...?"  
  
Bery tilted her head at Elvena's voice, who, like the other two, held a
controller.  
  
"I sometimes looked at historical records concerning that era... After
the major geological upheaval that destroyed many historical materials,
descriptions of Alberan greatly decreased. Of course, those concerning
major figures remained, but..."  
  
Once, the inhabitants of this planet faced the brink of extinction.  
Simultaneous volcanic eruptions due to a massive geological upheaval and
a winter of ash.  
For a time, people were pushed to the point where they couldn't live
outside magic shelters, and even here, there were several discussions
about whether or not to help them.  
  
If they wished, Krische and Kreschenta could easily do anything.  
However, the strong belief was that they should not interfere unless
this paradise was threatened.  
After they stepped outside the circle of the human world, they opted to
maintain at a least minimal amount of self-restraint.  
They concluded that they should not carelessly interfere unless they
were prepared to become true gods.  
  
They were relieved when the World Tree, which seemed to have responded
to the unconscious wishes of the people, eventually removed the ash
covering most of the planet, but everyone's faces remained somewhat
gloomy for several decades.  
  
*"This planet is my garden. It is the duty of my subjects to keep the
garden beautiful so that it may please my eyes and allow me to walk
comfortably."*  
  
After that, Kreschenta's queenly remark, the first in several millennia,
significantly lowered the standards.  
Regarding natural disasters beyond human control in that era—in short,
with the great queen's command to *silently and secretly help if it
means avoiding gloomy faces over trivial matters*, monitoring was
intensified afterward, and a policy of preventing major disasters was
established. However, such incidents also tended to cause civilization
to decline significantly.  
  
Much knowledge was lost among the people, especially less practical
historical materials.  
The once unified calendar was again divided, and fragmented materials
from before that time were often largely identfied as having low
reliability.  
  
From their perspective, it was simply a loss of knowledge, a clearly
continuous history, but from the perspective of those living in that
era, it was vastly different.  
Just as the great empire of Rusheran, which once boasted prosperity and
was destroyed by Kushenaras, was a fairy tale for them.  
For them, who had declined and struggled even to maintain simple magical
tools, the existence of a magical civilization that once mass-produced
such things must have been a dream akin to myth.  
  
The long years after the ash winter ended, until what was lost was
recovered.  
Many primary historical sources were lost, and as generations passed,
they witnessed firsthand how their own era transformed into myths and
legends mixed with fiction.  
  
"I believe that discussion was the cause, but after the Minalshi's
arrival, a major review of historical materials concerning Alberan and
Kleinmere was carried out, and most of the remaining materials at that
time should have been thoroughly examined. It's unlikely that new
materials would be found now."  
"...Yes, given the situation, the Minalshi must have investigated
seriously too."  
  
There was a bit of a commotion during the Minalshi's visit.  
Krische's hasty conclusion that aliens posed a danger of destroying the
planet led to their existence being revealed, causing considerable
alarm—and as a result, she ended up mediating peace between them and the
amoebas called Arnia.  
She picked up wiggly-wiggly, who was squirming and sleeping in the pouch
at Krische's waist, and smiled wryly.  
  
They seemed to be dutifully keeping their promise to forget their
existence and never interfere again, and the mansion remained
peaceful.  
Perhaps the fear of Krische's outrageous power played a significant
role—but in any case, at that time, investigating their own existence
must have been an urgent task for them.  
There was no doubt that they had gathered and examined historical
materials concerning Alberan, a distant ancient nation, and that must
have formed the basis of current historical descriptions.  
  
"You mean the descriptions recorded here are unnaturally accurate?"  
"Yes. There are several individuals who shouldn't be in the current
records... though I might be misremembering."  
"...Now that you mention it, yes. I don't remember everyone perfectly,
but there are names of people who weren't active on the battlefield, and
it is a bit unnatural."  
  
Selene frowned, gazing at the projected commander units.  
  
"Elvena-sama has a fairly good memory, after all. If she says so, it
must be. The names of the civilian nobles are arbitrary, but most of the
nobles with military ranks were actual people... I actually thought such
records had been properly preserved."  
  
"It's a little unsettling," Kreschenta said, looking at the sleeping
Krische.  
Bery, Selene, and Elvena also instinctively looked towards Krische.  
Most incidents at the mansion were usually Krische's fault.  
  
"Nn... mngh!?"  
  
Suddenly, Selene's hand pinched Krische's cheek, and Krische, who had
been happily sleeping, jumped up.  
  
"S-Selene...?"  
"It you're fault, isn't it? I know it."  
"...? W-What are you talking about... Uuu!"  
"Now, now... don't bully her."  
  
"That's right," Kreschenta said, glaring at Selene and wagging her
finger.  
Magic light streamed into the gaming console—causing Kreschenta to
frown.  
  
"Is something the matter?"  
"There was encrypted data sleeping inside. It's crude, but it's an
application of ancient engraving, which is rare these days."  
  
"Oh my," Bery said in surprise, and channeled magic to follow the path
Kreschenta had made.  
Far from crude, it was highly concealed encrypted text, woven into the
system designed for immersive gaming through magic manipulation.  
Modern humans, who only knew the four-element, two-principle engravings,
probably wouldn't even notice it.  
  
Reading the inscribed characters, the servant tilted her head.  
  
"...I would like to meet you, Master."  
  
She shook her red hair curiously, wondering what it meant. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
"But, game production, huh..."  
"I'm sorry... No, even I thought it was a bit much, but it was just too
timely, you could say."  
  
In Dogle's reception room, a black-haired girl bowed deeply next to
Mili, who scratched her cheek.  
She was Mili's childhood classmate and close friend—apparently named
Salia.  
She had visited Orus's house many times and had a long acquaintance with
Sena; if he thought about it, he remembered seeing her with Mili once
before he turned himself in.  
  
"…I understand the situation. I swear that I will not reveal Sena's
origins as a pure game development collaborator. If necessary, I will
provide a sworn statement. Of course, if the Professor still expresses
concern, I will give up and take what I heard today to my grave."  
"I understand your feelings. Well, please raise your head."  
  
The bespectacled girl raised her head, looking extremely nervous.  
She seemed to be quite a game enthusiast, and Mili had apparently just
been invited by her to create a game.  
The content was a simulation game set in the ancient Alberan Kingdom.  
  
Alberan was a major period among history buffs as it was the beginning
of the magical civilization that followed, and it was probably a time
before humanity was on the brink of extinction.  
A land of the children of god, preserved in countless plays, stories,
and legends.  
She was also an ardent fan of that era.  
  
Mili, as the daughter of a large company president, also seemed to have
a desire to create something herself without relying on her parents'
power.  
She had agreed to the idea, but was at a loss as to what to do about
Salia's request for an enormous amount of data. It was then that she
learned of Sena's origins and impulsively—  
  
Mili was scolded by Orus, who was exasperated that she understood how
delicate the matter was. Though her eyes welled up, Sena remained as
usual.  
  
*"If it is Mili-sama's request, I do not particularly mind."*  
  
So she said.  
  
Sena was generally like that.  
Even when her own story was being discussed, she didn't seem
particularly interested. Even now, she was next to them, listening while
role-playing a cookie cracker.  
It was always enough for her to be told the conclusion.  
Of course, if asked for her opinion, she would state her thoughts, but
if not spoken to, she would remain silent. Except for corrections on
pronunciation.  
  
When told that there were various reasons to conceal her origins, she
readily agreed, and seemed mostly uninterested in things, including
herself.  
To return a favor, and to fulfill a request—those two things were her
everything.  
  
However, precisely because of that, her words were a bit surprising.  
Her primary *favor recipient* was probably Dogle, and the second was
Orus.  
Orus's lecture was reasonable to anyone who heard it, and Orus's opinion
was born of concern for Sena's future, leaning towards safety.  
Mechanically and logically, it would have been appropriate to prioritize
Orus's opinion, and he thought it would usually be a situation where she
wouldn't interject.  
  
But Sena, after glancing at Mili's tearful face, said what she did.  
  
Her usual emotionless expression, her usual face and tone.  
Dogle said it might be good to listen to her, precisely because her
single remark seemed surprising.  
Strangely, somehow.  
Because in his heart, he felt that because it was surprising it made it
all the more so important.  
  
"What do you want to do, Sena?"  
"As I just stated... if Professor Chestnut Burr permits, there is no
particular reason to refuse Mili-sama's request."  
  
When asked, Sena tilted her head and replied. Dogle continued to
press.  
  
"Why did you decide to grant Mili-chan's request?"  
"Why...?"  
"Orus-san prioritized your safety, and I thought his lecture was
reasonable. Didn't you, Mili-chan?"  
"Eh? Oh, yes... I was clearly in the wrong."  
  
Mili mumbled awkwardly, and Dogle smiled wryly, saying, "I'm not blaming
you."  
  
"I thought you said that because you were concerned about Mili-chan."  
"...?"  
"It seemed to me that you spoke up at that moment because Mili-chan was
being scolded and on the verge of tears. Am I wrong?"  
  
"No, you are not," Sena replied, and Mili's eyes widened.  
  
"For example, what if Mili-chan had been perfectly calm? Would you have
similarly interrupted Orus-san's lecture?"  
"No. Mili-sama's tears were the deciding factor in that situation."  
"Why?"  
"Mili-sama's tears increase complications."  
  
Mili froze at her words, and Dogle smiled wryly.  
  
"Then, I see. What do you think about Orus-san scolding Mili-chan? Do
you think it was a unjust?"  
"No. I consider it a justified reprimand, prioritizing the concealment
of my origins."  
"That's right. To put it bluntly, Mili-chan was being a bit selfish and
annoying and received a well-deserved scolding. Compared to the risk of
your origins being revealed, the inconvenience of Mili-chan crying is a
minor issue. But you tried to protect her."  
  
Dogle nodded,  
  
"Don't you think that's an irrational decision?"  
  
He smiled at her as he said that.  
  
"...Irrational."  
"If your origins were revealed, not just you, but many people, including
me and Orus, would be in trouble. You sanctioned increasing that risk,
however slight, just because Mili-chan would be sad."  
  
Sena frowned at his words, as if pondering.  
Salia spoke up, flustered.  
  
"U-Um, Professor... this is just about our game production, and if you
say no, we really will—"  
"Ah, I'm sorry. I'm not blaming you or Sena. On the contrary, I'd like
to welcome your proposal."  
"Uh, what do you mean by that...?"  
"I made a promise with her. What we're discussing now is about that."  
  
It was one of the reasons he had entrusted Sena to Orus.  
He thought that she might gain more by interacting with a child like
Mili, who was loved and raised by her parents, rather than with Dogle,
who was an adult in both good and bad ways, and now single.  
  
Sena was exceptionally talented, but mentally, she was like a child.  
He had wanted her to experience childhood and family.  
He probably thought that idea was correct.  
  
"Any objections, Sena?"  
"...I believe it is a reasonable decision based on my internal
priorities and judgment criteria. However, as you say, I also consider
it an irrational decision."  
  
Sena tilted her head and said curiously,  
  
"It is difficult to comprehend."  
"It is difficult."  
  
Dogle laughed happily.  
  
"However, I believe that realization is very important."  
"...Important."  
"Humans are far more irrational creatures than you think. To avoid a
small, immediate disadvantage, they accept a larger disadvantage later,
or give up a great benefit. It's easy to call it an intelligence
problem, but I don't think it is."  
  
"For example," he said, picking up two cookies.  
  
"There are other people out there like you. Beings born with the same
intelligence and abilities. But surely, they now have completely
different thoughts and abilities. What do you think is the
difference?"  
"I believe it is the difference in accumulated experience."  
"That's right. It's the difference in what realizations you've gained
through your past experiences. For example, if there was a version of
you who never fought the red-haired women, do you think you would have
questioned a rule that prohibited it?"  
  
"No," Sena replied, and Dogle nodded.  
  
"That question is a realization unique to you. And such various
realizations shaped who you are now. While there may be comrades with
the same realizations, you are no longer the same as them, and humans
are also the same... You've come much closer to the answer you
desire."  
"...Is that so?"  
"Yes. I think so."  
  
Dogle laughed, looking at the two who seemed to be struggling to follow
the conversation.  
  
"If you're familiar with Alberan... you know why those who dominated the
battlefield at that time were captured by the Allied Forces, right?"  
"Eh... yes."  
"Sena apparently always wondered why Alberinea gave them such a
weakness."  
  
Their eyes widened, and they looked at each other.  
  
"When I heard that, I thought she should find that reason herself.
Because knowing and understanding are similar, yet different."  
  
Saying that, he handed Sena a cookie.  
  
"The promise was about that, and I told her I would help her find it.
And on top of that, I thought your proposal to create an entertainment
game would be good for her. ...Because creating something to please
someone will give her many experiences and insights."  
  
Then, he put the cookie in his mouth.  
She seemed to have mastered various dishes from the start, but what she
made every day was cookies.  
Old-fashioned, rustic honey cookies.  
Alberinea had apparently written that they were the basic yet best
cookies, taught by a woman named Bery, so she must have loved them
dearly.  
  
In her evaluation criteria, the name Bery was inscribed everywhere.  
A red-haired servant who reportedly served Alberinea.  
Jarea-Gashea was a being born out of love for such a servant.  
  
Sena wasn't even created to be rational in the first place.  
Her judgment criteria, her principles of action, and her unfathomable
*favors to return*.  
Dogle thought that she already knew, she just hadn't realized it yet.  
  
Dogle's role was merely to provide an opportunity.  
With just that, she would eventually realize.  
He was confident because she had been created such care.  
  
"If you're willing, I'd like you to help her find her answer too. If
that's acceptable, I'll also cooperate to the best of my ability."  
  
He asked how they felt, and the two looked at each other again, nodded,
and bowed deeply. 
<br /><br />

  
It's nice to think about the future.  
Even more so when it concerns young people.  
Dogle, by some standards, was still at an age that could be called
young, but he must have become a guardian when his beloved daughter was
born.  
Rather than what he would do next, he thought about how they would live
their lives.  
He spent time with them, contemplating such a future.  
  
Eventually, he would die, and Sena and others would walk the world
beyond.  
There were several things he had considered about Sena's future, but
life was full of unexpected events.  
Instead of the initial plan of having her utilize her excellent
abilities to help Orus's company, indulging the impulsive ideas of young
Mili and her friends would probably be more fitting for her.  
  
Alberinea was still a perplexing person, but somehow, looking at Sena,
he thought she might have lived that way herself.  
  
Turning an extraordinary combat machine into a servant—it seemed
insane.  
Cooking recipes and household functions incorporated on a whim.  
A mysterious obsession with pronunciation guidance demanding accurate
designations, based on a nickname evaluation standard whose purpose was
unknown.  
  
*"You know, Sena-san. I understand Jaragasha is the official name, but
stop correcting us arbitrarily, okay? This is Jare—"*  
*"Jaragasha, Mili-sama."*  
*"Ah, Sena-san? We both really want to call them Jaragasha, as it's the
correct pronunciation, but to hide Sena-san's origins, it's better to
use a different name, or the Professor and others will be in
trouble."*  
*"...I see."*  
  
Thinking of her as an innocent and child-like was fitting.  
Someone a little stubborn, with strong preferences, and free-spirited.  
  
As soon as the two returned from college, they were engrossed in their
discussions, "not like this, like that," and Sena accompanied them,
bringing back a lively atmosphere reminiscent of the past.  
Influenced by the atmosphere, Dogle also headed to Loctana's development
department and dedicated himself to mentoring younger researchers.  
On weekends, he would drink at his favorite bar, sometimes with Orus.  
Like in the old days, they would talk about the future.  
  
Perhaps influenced by his daughter's passion, who, using the apparently
unsuccessful first game as a stepping stone, poured even more passion
into the second. He invited Dogle to research and develop work clothing
for space.  
Work suits that utilized etheric bio-prosthetic technology, supporting
body movements without impeding them, and suitable for movement and
precise work in zero gravity.  
  
If that gained recognition and public acceptance, it would become easier
to release etheric bio-prosthetics that could replace the entire human
body, and gradually, a receptive environment for beings like Sena would
also be created.  
  
In modern times, there were surveillance networks everywhere for crime
prevention.  
Sena, though seemingly human, was a distorted existence when viewed
through the mechanical eyes of cameras that examined subjects.  
There were hardly any humans whose entire bodies were artificial, and
she stood out wherever she went.  
Even without ill intent, she would be looked at specially just by living
an ordinary daily life.  
  
He had always thought that the best way to hide a tree was in a
forest.  
Orus's plan was an indirect one, requiring an enormous amount of time,
but it wasn't bad considering the vast amount of time Sena would have in
the future.  
He didn't know if the seeds would sprout as intended, but if such a
future was possible in a hundred, two hundred—a thousand years, it was
worth dreaming about.  
  
Dogle accepted the proposal and once again took his hand, returning to
the path of research.  
—Looking back, it had been a life that never felt boring.  
  
"Professor Chestnut Burr, your tea is ready."  
"...Ah, thank you."  
  
He sat up in bed, scratched his head, and reached for the bedside
table.  
He had long grown accustomed to his short, white hair.  
Whenever Dogle's hair grew out, Sena would say, "Shall I trim your
hair?", so he ended up spending his days with a subtly grown-out buzz
cut.  
  
She must have really liked the name "Chestnut Burr."  
The first time he saw her sad face was when Dogle said he wanted to grow
his hair a little longer.  
  
*"…S-Sena?"*  
*"...No. If you say my care is unnecessary, then nothing."*  
*"T-That's not what I meant—"*  
  
Since then, Dogle stopped commenting on her hair care.  
Sena, with her usual emotionless expression, sat on the bedside chair,
eating a cookie while gazing at Dogle.  
  
"It's getting worse. Are you still not planning to replace it with a
prosthetic body?"  
"The times haven't caught up yet. Besides, even if I prolong my life,
there's still a technical limit to the brain's lifespan... I won't be
able to watch over you forever."  
  
Fifty years passed in the blink of an eye.  
Development went well, and they further developed a skin suit that
allowed humans who couldn't use ether to control virtual muscles, and
its latest model started appearing on the market.  
Then, just when he thought he had done everything he could, he
collapsed.  
An etheric anomaly in his body, which could be called the lifespan of a
long-lived species.  
Even in modern times, where many things have been discovered, much about
ether remains unknown.  
  
The basic palliative treatment was brain transplantation.  
The fundamental problem was immune deficiency and organ failure due to
the loss of ether protection.  
He could be saved by transplanting his brain into a bio-cultured body,
and with the etheric bio-prosthetic body they had created, he could even
get a better body than before.  
Many desired to prolong their lives that way, but for Dogle, his past
had been half his remaining life.  
Moreover, having felt he had done everything he wanted, he thought it
best to let nature take its course.  
  
"...According to one theory,"  
"...?"  
"There's something called a soul that we can't perceive, and the body is
its vessel. It's said that this soul is what controls ether."  
  
There were many etherologists who supported the soul hypothesis.  
Even after unraveling the brain, which controls thought, humanity had
not yet clarified what influenced ether.  
Investigating the brain's activity when ether was moved revealed
tendencies, but how it directly influenced it remained unknown.  
  
"It's not scientifically proven; it's like a belief."  
"…A belief."  
  
"I was also half in doubt," he chuckled.  
  
"When long-lived species like us lose the ability to manipulate ether,
it often happens after we've accomplished something or feel satisfied...
Well, it's said that it often happens when the soul has finished its
work in this world. Experiencing it, I can see how it makes sense."  
"Do you mean you wish to die?"  
"It's not a negative thought; it's more like a feeling of relief."  
  
He chuckled at her direct words typical of her and sipped his tea.  
He was still healthy enough to drink her tea himself.  
  
The game development he worked on with Mili and others became quite
popular with its second title, and the three of them started a
company.  
There were some problems, but after a while, it became a subsidiary of
Loctana, and now it occupies a corner of their entertainment business.  
Mili and Salia seemed to have made various arrangements to install Sena
as the next president. It wasn't long ago that news of an AI becoming
president caused a stir.  
  
There was some commotion, as expected, but perhaps due to the nature of
the entertainment business, which provides entertainment to people, and
Orus's and their efforts behind the scenes, most of the media reported
it favorably, and it didn't escalate into a major—or violent—incident.  
During the interviews in that process, Dogle's dishonorable nickname,
Professor Chestnut Burr, became known to the public, but if her earnest
and somewhat disarming side helped alleviate concerns about *an AI
rebelling against humanity*, it wasn't so bad.  
  
In any case, her future was not bleak, but bright.  
  
"You've been accepted by society. There will be various problems from
now on, but you'll overcome them. And my research has reached a
conclusion... When I thought that a good future awaited you, I felt my
strength drain away."  
  
Dogle laughed as he said that.  
  
"I must have felt that what should be called my soul was satisfied with
this."  
"...Difficult to comprehend."  
"Hehe, it is difficult."  
  
Her usual emotionless expression.  
But also, just a little, a face that looked sad.  
  
"Will you be lonely when I'm gone?"  
"It will be troublesome, as I will be unable to return the favor."  
  
"I see," Dogle smiled wryly and stroked her head.  
  
"If I were to give you a hint to your old question, then, yes,"  
  
Dogle said to Sena, who tilted her head.  
  
"Perhaps Alberinea had many favors to return. And returning those favors
was the most important thing to Alberinea."  
"Many favors to return...?"  
"Indeed. So many that they could never be fully returned."  
  
As he stroked her head, her eyes narrowed, and her mouth softened just a
little.  
With such a small gesture, Sena must have accumulated many *favors in
return*.  
In that way, she would probably continue to accumulate intangible
*favors in return* forever.  
Something called *favors in return* that she could never fully repay, no
matter how much she tried.  
  
He wondered why Alberinea hadn't given it a different name.  
There must have been a more fitting name than anything else.  
Then she wouldn't have agonized so much, and her doubts would have
simply melted away.  
  
She must have witnessed her own anecdotes many times, set in Alberan.  
Yet, she remained unaware and still troubled.  
  
"It's like the nickname you gave me."  
"...?"  
"I think Alberinea left you the task of figuring out what wonderful name
you would give me. Just a hunch, though."  
  
Alberinea must have cherished that emotion more than anything else.  
That it was not something others should easily teach, but something one
should decide for oneself.  
  
"In any case, Alberinea would surely be very happy if she saw you
now."  
"Is that so?"  
"Yes. Because Alberinea would have wished for you to agonize so
diligently."  
  
Dogle closed his eyes and nodded.  
  
"She passed away a long time ago... but looking at you, I can truly
understand what she wished for when she created you."  
  
Holding incredible knowledge, yet knowing nothing like a newborn.  
An innocent child, given only the necessary materials, troubled and
confused.  
It was precisely because she wished for her to gain answers through her
own power, to cherish that process, that she was so inconsistent.  
  
Perhaps she was a person who cherished irrational things above all
else.  
Dogle thought he understood at least that much, and quietly smiled,
sipping his tea.  
  
"Um, Professor Chestnut Burr."  
  
He looked towards the voice.  
  
"I believe Master is still alive."  
  
—He choked on his tea.
