## Chapter 344: Charm III

She didn't believe Rubel was a bad person.  
His gentle demeanor from her childhood and his kindness towards Bery
were both aspects of his character. There was likely no deceit in his
willingness to accept Lazura’s whims without complaint, his teaching of
her sister, his recognition of her talent, or his encouragement to
pursue a scholarly path.  
  
However, humans possess many facets, and no one is perfect. What usually
appeared on the surface was not everything.  
  
Everyone merely strives not to reveal their darker side, not to
acknowledge it. Even if it occasionally surfaces, that too is not the
whole picture. Perhaps he was also someone who had experienced setbacks
and was tormented by feelings of inferiority. Yet, Lazura also believed
he was genuinely a dedicated and kind teacher who cared deeply for
children.  
  
After a while, he calmed down and felt regret. Later, he visited the
mansion, explained the situation to her father, and conveyed his
intention to resign as a teacher. He then bowed his head to Lazura and
apologized for saying cruel things to Bery due to his immaturity. It was
likely a heartfelt apology. He expressed a desire to apologize to Bery
if she would forgive him, but Bery was ill and bedridden, so Lazura
relayed his words to her later.  
  
Lazura believed Bery felt she could not face Rubel. She deeply regretted
having angered Rubel, whom she must have truly respected. For a while
after that, Bery would pretend to be asleep when Lazura appeared. Even
when she started speaking again, she no longer left her room to get
books herself, nor did she ask anything on her own.  
  
The servants whispered behind their backs about Bery angering the gentle
Rubel, and they grew even more wary of her now that she stayed confined
to her room. Her sister, who had just begun to show interest in the
outside world, spent her time in bed, closing her heart even more than
before. She would often tell Lazura to keep her distance, saying she did
not need to show her face anymore.  
  
"…I don't have an appetite."  
"No, you must eat, even if you force yourself. Onee-sama won't leave
until you finish eating."  
  
Her body was much thinner than before. Her health had significantly
worsened, yet she would leave her meals, claiming she wasn't hungry. It
was worrying, especially during a period of significant growth.  
  
"Here, open wide."  
  
When Lazura forcibly pressed the spoon to her mouth, Bery finally began
to drink the soup. After repeating this several times, tears spilled
from her downcast eyes; she covered her face and quietly began to cry.
She coughed as she sobbed, and Lazura stroked her back, repeating the
motion until her sister calmed down.  
  
When Lazura hugged her, Bery relaxed as if in relief—and yet resisted.
Her body became slack, then stiff. She disliked herself for clinging to
her sister, and she disliked herself for being taken care of. She
whispered in a faint voice, "I want to disappear." Day after day, her
sister continued to blame herself in her mind. She blamed herself,
believing she had been a burden ever since she was born.  
  
Her sister, perhaps, had never once viewed herself positively since
birth. Despite possessing talents everyone envied, she was dominated by
inferiority. She couldn't do things ordinary people could do normally.
She couldn't understand things ordinary people could understand
normally. Only ideals inflated around her talent, not even allowing
herself the excuse of being a child. She blamed herself for all the
misfortunes that surrounded her.  
  
Lazura imagined, tried to understand, and then denied such thoughts from
Bery. Even when she repeatedly told her not to blame herself, the words
did not quite get through. Still, she believed there was at least a
little something that would reach her; there was no other choice but to
exhaust her words.  
  
"Even if you hate yourself enough to want to disappear, I love you a
hundred times more. …If you ever wish to disappear, live for your
Onee-sama who loves you."  
  
Lazura gently stroked her sister's head; she didn't answer.  
  
"And don't ever say such things again. …It makes Onee-sama sad."  
  
The same words, again and again. If even a little bit reached her, that
was enough. Among the voices of her sister blaming herself, there was a
need for just one different voice.  
  
She hoped that someday, her sister would be able to stop blaming
herself. She wished that these words could be one such reason. 
<br /><br />

  
One day, a stout man emerged from the reception room.  
  
"Oh my, if it isn't Lazura-sama… you've become even more beautiful. It's
been since Count Vertis's banquet."  
"…It has been a while. Are you here for a business meeting with my
father today?"  
"Indeed."  
  
A polite bow and tasteful attire. Yet, what made him difficult to like
was probably his eyes. Eyes that seemed to be appraising her.  
  
Lazura tried to avoid him as much as possible, but she knew he had been
coming and going several times recently. He wasn't quite a "great
merchant," but he conducted extensive business despite his youth. Her
father said he was an excellent merchant for his age, and the Argan
family had apparently cooperated with him before on a problem in their
managed territory, which led to their connection.  
  
"How is Bery-sama doing?"  
"She's not very well, but she's settled down…"  
"…Is that so? I've been looking around for good doctors myself… For now,
I've brought some things said to be nourishing for your father."  
"…Thank you. That's a great help."  
  
His theatrical, exaggerated gestures and expressions. Lazura couldn't
bring herself to like him, but he was her father's business associate.
He had also brought various beneficial things for Bery's health. At the
time, she thought she had to be grateful. She knew there were rumors
that the Argan family was in decline, and ties with merchants were
crucial.  
  
"I hope she makes a full recovery. I pray for it from the bottom of my
heart."  
  
He placed a hand on his chest and bowed his head, his behavior
ostentatious. Despite his exaggeration, Lazura didn't think his words
were a lie, probably because Roland genuinely cared about her sister's
health. For him, Lazura and Bery were likely already future
commodities.  
  
Only those who sought to exploit them approached declining nobles.
Lazura was too unaware of society and too optimistic to understand that
for merchants, nobles alone held value. She believed that with effort,
things would always eventually improve.  
  
After parting with him, Lazura went to the reception room. Her father
was there, looking troubled, examining contracts and documents. His
mustache was neatly trimmed, and his red hair was carefully combed back.
Her father, Realde Argan, never let his noble demeanor falter. His
jacket was spotless, and his trousers were perfectly creased. Yet,
tiredness was visible around his eyes, and his deep dark circles
couldn't be hidden.  
  
"…Father."  
"Lazura? …How's Bery?"  
"She's settled. …But—"  
"…?"  
"…No. She's just a little down in spirits."  
  
She always came to consult about Bery, but seeing her father's face, she
couldn't bring herself to speak. His tired face—the light in her
father's room never went out until late at night. When the sun rose, he
would go out, show his face in various places, and return after touring
around. She knew how much her father had devoted himself to her
stepmother and sister. She couldn't add any more to his mental burden.  
  
"I'll go see her a little later. Come here."  
"…Yes."  
  
But he smiled as if he understood, and stroked Lazura, who had sat down
beside him.  
  
"I've caused you much trouble as well. I'm sorry."  
"No, no trouble at all…"  
  
The touch of his kind, large hand. Being stroked like that, she felt
relieved like a child, which was a little shameful. Compared to her
suffering sister and father, Lazura lived much more carefree. Blessed
with many things, she hadn't experienced hardship.  
  
"Father."  
"What is it?"  
"Well… I've also learned the basics of scholarship. After that, I think
I can self-study without relying on a teacher, enough not to embarrass
myself."  
"…Such things are not for a child to worry about."  
"I'm already 13. I'm not a child."  
  
When she said this, her father gave a wry smile and stroked her head
again.  
  
"Children always say that. …But if you insist you're an adult, it's good
to think about things from a broader perspective."  
"Broader perspective…?"  
"If we let the teacher go, we would certainly save on education costs.
To our shame, it's also a significant financial burden for our family,
and there's great merit in cutting it. Is that what you're thinking?"  
"…? Yes…"  
"You're not wrong," her father continued.  
  
"However, the Argan family is already rumored by those around us to be
in decline. If we were to dismiss even the private tutor on top of that,
the rumor would spread that we've finally run out of money. In such a
family, Lazura, would you, for example, think of lending them money?"  
"…No."  
"That's right, because you wouldn't be trusted. That's how you have to
look at things, from various angles. It's not just about money, you
see."  
"Remember that well," her father smiled.  
  
Her father always smiled gently at Lazura. To her father, Lazura was
always his daughter, his child.  
  
"And nobles are beings that exist solely by trust. Under His Majesty's
protection, in exchange for being granted many rights, we are required
to live without sullying our own name, the family name we inherited, and
His Majesty's name. …This is by no means vanity."  
  
He sipped black bean tea and narrowed his eyes.  
  
"To value one's name more than life is the way of a noble. As long as
one is born a noble, even if one were to lose food, clothing, and
shelter, one must live without disgracing one's name. …I married two
wonderful wives and had two beloved children."  
  
Then he looked at Lazura and stroked her head.  
  
"I swore on this name before my wives. I will surely make both you and
Bery happy. …So, don't worry about me, rest assured. All worries will
disappear eventually."  
"…Yes."  
  
Her father was truly the noble she respected more than anyone. One who
would sacrifice for his name—no matter what happened, he would never
betray his name. No matter how difficult, he was a person who could live
that way as a matter of course.  
  
"Today, Roland brought us a good proposal. If we can gather the funds,
we can make a considerable profit. Using that as capital, many problems
will likely be resolved."  
  
Saying so, he indicated the documents, and Lazura took them. It was a
transaction concerning magic crystals, whose output had been decreasing
in recent years. A large lode had reportedly been discovered in the
north, and a significant price drop was about to occur. Anticipating
this, they would preemptively sign a long-term sales contract with the
artisan guild at a fixed price.  
  
If the price of magic crystals dropped, the difference would be their
share. Since they had to secure long-term contracts with them
beforehand, the price would be somewhat lower than the current market
price, but not so much as to be a major risk. From a quick glance, there
seemed to be no problems. —Unless the price unexpectedly soared.  
  
"Is there no risk of a price surge?"  
"Of course, I considered it… but even if the large lode isn't as
expected, the rebound would be minor. As for war, Elderant, having lost
the war, is in the midst of internal strife, and it's only been a short
time since a new government was established in Gulshan. It will
definitely be fine. Elsren is currently in turmoil to decide the next
emperor… they won't attack for a while either."  
  
If war broke out, primary industries like mining would inevitably
shrink.  
Laborers would flow into more lucrative soldiering, and the associated
manpower would also be drawn into the war effort.  
Naturally, the price of mineral resources circulating generally would
greatly increase.  
While there are differences depending on demand, magic crystals are used
in daily necessities.  
The demand itself wouldn't increase as much as iron ore, but it wouldn't
decrease either, and prices would be heavily influenced by output.  
  
"Then there's the possibility of this country invading other nations…
but His Majesty has only recently inherited the throne from the late
King Alberza. He's busy with the transition and probably wouldn't have
the leisure to invade other nations… and Roland's story seems to confirm
that."  
"I see…"  
"He's a well-connected man… in that regard, he can be trusted. Simply
thinking about it, I don't believe they'll immediately invade other
nations, and no such rumors have reached us. Well, I don't think there's
a problem… but just in case, I plan to lightly ask my acquaintances
about that area."  
"…Is that so?"  
  
From what she heard, there seemed to be no problems. Considering the
political situation Lazura was aware of, her father's judgment didn't
seem wrong, and the odds of success were likely high. Business couldn't
be considered without risk. Given the risks and returns, it was not a
bad deal.  
  
Roland was originally from the central region, his origin being
Kielzaran. He reportedly often showed his face in the royal capital, so
the accuracy of his information would be high. There was some uneasiness
about Roland being the one to bring up the deal, but the Argan family
had gained considerable profit from his previous transactions, and aside
from her personal dislike of him, there seemed to be no problem.  
  
"It's not without risk for us, and although this is business, I feel
somewhat reserved… But from what I've seen, the trading partners are all
large, well-known establishments. There won't be a decline in
management. …Pursuing profit is the way of a merchant. If the profit
becomes too large, we might need to review the contract… but to greedily
gain profit by threatening their livelihoods goes against the way of a
noble."  
"…Yes."  
  
His troubled expression was likely due to that reason. In the business
world, information is everything, and suffering losses due to ignorance
is one's own responsibility. That's why merchants extensively connect
with people in various regions and gather all sorts of information. But
her father was a noble, not a merchant. Although it wouldn't be
considered fraud, she thought this was a method he did not desire.  
  
If her father had been alone, he might not have approved of it. He was
an honest person who disliked crookedness. But he decided to choose
this, surely for Lazura and Bery. To keep his oath to make Lazura and
Bery happy from becoming a lie.  
  
"…I truly am fortunate, aren't I?"  
  
When her father tilted his head, Lazura shook her head and smiled.  
  
"I just suddenly thought so."  
  
There were many people around Lazura who were necessary for her to learn
and re-examine herself.  
Just for that, Lazura was far more blessed than anyone else. 
<br /><br />

  
The business deal between her father and Roland was indeed not a bad
one. There could only be one problem with it.  
  
Unless Roland had intentionally hidden information to trick her
father.  
It was only a deal that depended on such a premise.  
  
Less than a year after the contract was signed, Prince Gildanstein began
his invasion of Elsren in eastern Wulfenite. Against Alberan, who had
pushed deep, Elsren retreated, burning villages as they went. Afterward,
they began a counterattack—resulting in a drawn-out, muddy war.  
  
Roland prostrated, apologizing tearfully. He claimed it was an
unexpected invasion, almost entirely at the Prince's discretion. Her
father nodded to Roland, who declared he would do his best to help
restore their finances. There was likely nothing else he could do.  
  
Although he inwardly suspected Roland had tricked them, there were no
merchants or nobles willing to conduct new business with the Argan
family, who had suffered such a major failure. He had no choice but to
believe Roland, who insisted it was an accidental tragedy.  
  
Her father, who had already been under severe mental strain and
overworking his body, desperately ran around trying to recover from the
failure. After a while, he collapsed and passed away when Lazura was
about fifteen. Lazura told her father, who lay in bed with tears in his
eyes, apologizing, that it was alright.  
  
For the first time in her life, she swore on her name, and continued,
saying, "Please leave it to me."
