## Chapter 338: Crescent Moon at Dawn – The End

And so, the shop was completed, and before the opening, we gathered our
friends for a feast.  
Although some couldn't come due to work, nearly two hundred people
gathered, causing the large shop to overflow. At first, I thought the
shop was too big, but I realized it was the right size. If we had been
timid and made the shop smaller, we would never have seen this sight.  
  
We started preparing the day before, cooking and getting everything
ready.  
That day, I learned a lot.  
Beltz and I had planned for a varied menu, but with this large shop, the
two of us were overwhelmed.  
If we made dishes every time we needed them, we’d keep the customers
waiting.  
We could prepare for the banquet, but we couldn't handle two hundred
orders at once.  
  
"We should reduce the number of grilled dishes. It’s best to focus on
dishes that don't need to be warmed or are easy to serve, such as soups
and stews, which can be prepared the day before or in the morning."  
  
Kalua and Mia’s table.  
There, sitting on Kalua's lap and looking at the menu was
Krische-sama.  
Her unusually serious face made Beltz and I straighten up. Krische-sama
was generally a rather casual person. Even when conveying battle
strategies, she was so carefree that it made us lose our focus. But the
moment the subject turned to cooking, she instantly switched gears.  
  
I always think it's the opposite of what should be, but that's just
Krische Christand.  
She can't be measured by the values of ordinary people.  
  
"Yes...Actually, after seeing how many people came, Koza and I were
talking about how this is impossible."  
"It’s not impossible, but even if we assume Krische and Bery are cooking
here, the peak time with this menu is quite something. To balance speed
and quality, you have to concentrate considerably on the cooking."  
  
Krische-sama put down the menu, crossed her arms, and closed her eyes.  
  
"Good things are born from leisure. And Bery’s teaching is that the
ideal of work is to be able to do it at 30% or 40% of your full
capacity. The important thing is to be able to handle any problems that
arise with composure."  
  
Then, as usual, she uttered Bery’s famous saying, and Krische-sama
nodded repeatedly. While I was somewhat dumbfounded, it was true.  
Missed orders, mistakes in serving, and troubles are inevitable.  
  
"The basis of work is to be able to cope calmly, even considering all
possible inconveniences and worst-case scenarios. Increasing your
abilities to create more leeway is one approach, but it's more realistic
to distribute the workload per unit of time so that you can handle
it."  
"I see."  
"It's a little expensive, but increasing the number of freezers would be
good. Things like pies can be made ahead of time and frozen, and there's
no problem putting them straight into the oven. We could also increase
the number of oven dishes instead of grilled dishes..."  
  
And so, she gave us various advice.  
Having spent years researching cooking every day, her wealth of
knowledge was astounding. Alberinea, whose name echoed throughout the
world, was more serious about cooking than war.  
Apparently, Krische-sama had read and verified countless documents, and
her stories were invaluable. While the others were making merry while
drinking, Beltz and I were engrossed in the cooking lecture.  
  
"I understand that you’re trying your best with affordable ingredients
for the common people, and they're all fairly tasty, but they're just
'fairly tasty'. You should think a little more about the main and
supporting ingredients."  
"Main and supporting ingredients..."  
"Yes. If each plays its role, that's good enough. Not everything has to
be excellent."  
  
Krische-sama said this, then glanced at the people drinking around us.  
Her eyes narrowed in a somewhat happy way.  
  
"Various ingredients come together to create one dish."  
  
She proudly raised a finger, saying Bery said that, with her usual
radiant smile.  
  
I think it’s strange.  
To be honest, I still don't understand Krische-sama.  
Her basic thought processes are different, and that's natural.  
  
She says what she thinks, so in that sense, she's easy to understand,
but even if you think you've read Krische-sama's mind, the words that
come out of her mouth are always unexpected.  
I've given up on ever understanding her.  
  
But at that moment, I understood what she was thinking when she looked
at those people.  
Beltz and I exchanged glances and nodded.  
  
We are supporting players. Only supporting players.  
We are not the kind of people who can be the main character. But...for
example, if a main character girl, who casually stopped by,  
  
‘This shop is always delicious’  
  
smiles and eats here, it’s not so bad to be a shopkeeper or chef who
provides that kind of experience.  
  
Even as supporting players, we can be delicious supporting players. 
<br /><br />

"Father, you’re drinking alcohol...Really, I don’t care if you die."  
"I can drink before I die, can’t I? Don’t worry, I’ll be dead
tomorrow."  
  
His daughter sighed wearily and placed the lamb stew she had brought
onto the counter. Lamb stew, simmered until meltingly tender from the
day before.  
It was simmered down using a soup base extracted from vegetables, and
deepened in flavor with red wine.  
  
The Crescent Moon at Dawn's lamb stew. A signature dish known to
everyone, always ordered by regulars.  
A spoonful revealed a richness balanced by a refreshing acidity.  
  
"Today's is solidly Beltz’ taste."  
"That's right, delicious."  
  
Tagel replied, and I closed my eyes.  
  
Krische-sama often visited the shop. Mostly to eat lunch with Mia and
Kalua.  
  
Krische-sama wasn't particularly picky about taste. She'd say it was
delicious if she thought so, without being pretentious.  
Her skill was superb; when she held a knife, she created dishes that
were works of art that Beltz and I couldn't match, but she didn’t demand
that level of quality from the food served to her.  
  
Well, deliciousness reaches a certain level, where the difference
becomes subtle.  
It’s subjective, and even if there are slight shortcomings, it doesn't
make it unappetizing.  
Even a 60 out of 100 is delicious when you're hungry.  
No one would call an 80-point dish bad, and anything above that is a
matter of personal preference.  
  
In that sense, Krische-sama was quite easygoing and relaxed as a
customer.  
She wouldn't criticize anyone's cooking unless it was really bad.  
But Beltz and I couldn’t be satisfied with that.  
  
Looking back, it's funny, but we probably wanted to be praised. We
wanted to create dishes that would make Krische-sama think, from the
bottom of her heart, that the shop's food was excellent and make her
specifically visit to eat them.  
Not because it was her subordinate’s shop, or because she was out in
town.  
  
After seeing Krische-sama off after she said "it was delicious," Beltz
and I recalled her reaction and debated back and forth.  
  
‘I thought today's soup was excellent in both taste and aroma...but it’s
just the same. It was my best work...’  
  
Beltz slumped his shoulders and sighed, and as always, I patted his
shoulder.  
  
‘Don't be so down. I think this soup was excellent too,
but...considering our progress so far, maybe we’re heading in the wrong
direction.’  
‘Wrong?’  
‘Even you can’t beat Krische-sama in skill. Naturally, you won't beat
her even if you make the kind of food Krische-sama usually makes. To
impress Krische-sama, we should challenge her with dishes and flavors
she doesn't usually make.’  
  
Krische-sama learned cooking from Bery-sama. Bery-sama was also a
noblewoman by birth, and her style was delicate and elegant—noble
cuisine combining various ingredients. Krische-sama's cooking was
basically in that style.  
  
‘Precisely, mass-market...punchy, commoner food served in pubs. How
about using that as a base and arranging it nicely?’  
‘...I see. Punchy, huh?’  
‘Yes, stews instead of soups, things like that.’  
  
The biggest difference between noble cuisine and other styles was the
ingredients.  
For example, commoners use strongly scented vegetables and herbs to mask
the smell of meat and create delicious dishes.  
Krische-sama, who uses only first-class ingredients in the royal
territory, creates dishes that highlight the taste of the ingredients,
but she probably doesn’t do that kind of cooking.  
  
‘No matter how good the ingredients are, we can’t create a main dish
that will satisfy Krische-sama with the level of ingredients we handle.
Then, let's gather low-quality supporting ingredients and mask their
flaws to create a delicious dish.’  
‘...Maybe that would be more interesting to Krische-sama.’  
‘Exactly. What do you think?’  
‘...Not bad. Let’s do that, Koza.’  
  
I'm practically an amateur when it comes to cooking. Of course, I don't
hate it, and I’m confident I can cook better than the average guy. But
Beltz, unlike me, has knowledge and thinks in a different dimension than
a ‘mere cooking enthusiast’. He's a natural craftsman. In fact, if he
got along with his father, he could have worked as a chef in the royal
palace.  
  
It took a month and a half to verify my simple idea late at night every
night and refine it into a true masterpiece.  
While using a hearty, mass-market stew as a base, we adjusted the
combination of ingredients and herbs and the simmering method, adding
depth and delicacy. We created a lamb stew that would amaze everyone
from simple palates to gourmets.  
  
This became quite popular in the neighborhood, and we laughed, thinking
we were onto something.  
  
‘...How is it?’  
  
Krische-sama frowned and made a difficult face.  
  
‘What's wrong, Krische-sama?’  
‘Hmm, was it too strong for Usa-chan? I thought it was delicious.’  
‘Yes. I thought it was very delicious too...’  
‘...Yes, it's a little strong, but not too strong. Maybe it would go
well with bread.’  
  
Unlike Krische-sama, who usually ate while chatting, she ate silently.
After finishing the stew and eating three pieces of bread,  
  
‘...Krische’ll bring Selene and the others three nights from now. Be
prepared.’  
‘Eh? Y-yes…’  
  
So she said. 
<br /><br />

"It's a delicious stew. Even though he died, this taste remains
unchanged. Even if I die, it won't change."  
  
He broke a piece of melting lamb meat with a spoon, put it in his mouth,
and then looked up at the ceiling.  
The voices of the customers echoed in the high ceiling, and busy sounds
came from the kitchen.  
  
Beltz died quite a while ago, but he seemed quite satisfied. Before his
death, he sat at the counter like this, eating lamb stew.  
I’ll probably die the same way.  
  
"Don’t you think it’s pathetic? All you leave behind after spending your
whole life is one shop. You’re just a bakery owner, that’s your fate.
You're not a world-renowned great hero or a great person. When you were
a kid, you probably planned to become a much more important person,
right?"  
"If you know your limits, you can have the appropriate amount of
happiness. I don’t think I’m unhappy, and I’ve had a good life."  
"It’s not interesting, but that's true. It’s pathetic, but not bad. I've
lived for a hundred years without doing anything great, yet strangely,
I’m satisfied."  
  
Born into a poor family, I learned to steal, and unknowingly, the back
alleys became my home.  
Drinking alcohol, buying women—I eventually got tired of pretending and
even got a wife who wasn't beautiful but laughed a lot.  
We lived in the shadows. Since I started serving that crazy princess, a
lot of things have changed, but even when I’m flattered as a hero, I’m
just a pathetic man. My existence wouldn't change the world, even if I
was gone.  
  
"I’m a pathetic person. But, what about Krische-sama, the great hero?
She's very happy with this pathetic existence. She's probably having a
party over there now."  
"...Maybe."  
"In a way, I think that’s how it is with everyone. We're all pathetic,
you know."  
  
I tilted my glass, emptied it, and exhaled along with the alcohol.  
I ate the rest of the stew, stood up, and patted Tagel on the
shoulder.  
  
"I’m in a good mood thanks to you. See you later, Tagel."  
"Ah. ...Sleep well, Koza."  
"...You too."  
  
I smiled at the words, and headed up the stairs. Before I went upstairs,
I turned to look back at the bustling shop.  
  
‘—It’s very delicious.’  
  
In the center of the large shop, Her Majesty the Queen and Selene-sama,
accompanied by two servants. Krische-sama, arms crossed, said with a
serious face.  
  
‘This lamb stew…doesn’t have the beauty or delicacy of the best dishes
B, Krische—cough.’  
  
Krische-sama glanced at Selene-sama for a moment, and then coughed
ostentatiously. Selene-sama blushed and sighed at the sight.  
We were curious about this mysterious exchange, but Beltz and I didn't
have the time to worry about it.  
  
‘...Well…compared to the best dishes Krische has eaten so far, it lacks
beauty and delicacy. However, that doesn’t mean that we can't evaluate
the deliciousness of this dish, which skillfully combines ingredients of
inferior quality.’  
  
She nodded repeatedly and said.  
  
‘I have Selene’s permission. Krische will grant this shop the simplified
crest of the Christand family.’  
‘…!’  
‘But do not become arrogant. Continue to improve your skills. If, by any
chance, the taste deteriorates, Krische will not hesitate to revoke the
simplified crest.’  
  
As Krische-sama said this with her finger raised, Beltz saluted,
overwhelmed with emotion.  
  
‘Yes, thank you very much! We did it, Koza! It’s thanks to you!!’  
‘You idiot, it’s thanks to your hard work!’  
  
What an unbelievably sentimental guy, hugging me like that.  
  
While imagining that scene, I headed upstairs with my heavy body.  
I walked down the long corridor, went to my room, and threw myself onto
the bed.  
  
I felt quite good even though I only drank a little. I feel the same as
yesterday, when I almost died. I wouldn't mind not waking up.  
  
Outside the window, a ridiculously large tree was in full bloom with
rainbow-colored flowers.  
The moon, which was faintly visible halfway up the sky when I woke up,
had faded away.  
The sun shone brightly on the flowers, creating a fantastic color.  
The world outside the window looked beautiful, like a dream.  
  
The most foolish, crazy garden of love in the world. Thinking that I had
gone to that ridiculous world, this world may actually be a dream.  
A dream created by that princess.  
I was just a supporting character, someone who could be found anywhere,
in her carefree dream.  
  
I guess she'll come to visit again someday. She’ll reminisce about
granting this shop the simplified crest, and we'll laugh together.  
  
I don't know how many years it will last, but it'll be safe for a while.
Beltz’ taste remains, passed down to his grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.  
  
"I’ll guarantee the taste."  
  
—For a hundred years to come, thank you for your patronage.  
  
I closed my eyes, imagining the smiling face of my princess. 
<br /><br />

  
Crescent Moon at Dawn is a shop serving mass-market cuisine. I heard it
was established by members of the Black Flag Special Unit, and
apparently, Alberinea and Her Majesty the Queen visited incognito
several times back then. But that was a long time ago.  
Noble customers rarely visit, only those in the know.  
  
"The change is fine."  
"Well…thank you."  
  
On that day, there were, unusually, seven beautiful women. They were
probably nobles.  
These are uncommon customers for this establishment.  
  
After finishing their meal, they happily paid with silver coins,
appearing very pleased.  
Relieved that they enjoyed their meal, I asked,  
  
"Were you satisfied with your meal?"  
"Yes, very much so."  
  
The servant-like girl, wearing an apron dress, smiled like a blossoming
flower.  
  
"Ehehe, it was delicious as always."
