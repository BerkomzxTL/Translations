## Chapter 311: Reine XII

TN: I compiled chapters 1-363 here. I recommend reading at least 311-363 in the pdf version instead as it looks a lot nicer:

---------------------------------------------------

A bright afternoon.  
People were amazed by the numerous paintings lined up in the church's
cathedral.  
  
Even amateurs could not doubt their realism.  
The gradation of colors, the detailed depictions, and the beauty of the
light.  
Though depicting an otherworldly paradise, each painting was drawn as if
a slice of reality itself, its power surpassing that of mere
paintings.  
  
The paintings seemed impossible to have been created by human hands.  
Even a genius, spending their entire life, could not have painted even
one of them.  
Even if it were said that the painter—the Sacred Emperor Elsreine—was a
being equal to God, no one would dare to object.   
They were truly divinely created paintings.  
  
A dozen or so "Paradises" were lined up, and visitors formed a line,
making donations as they gazed at them with exclamations of wonder.  
Words like, "How beautiful," and "It's unbelievable that this is a
painting," echoed through the space.  
Combined with the solemn music played by the orchestra, some were even
moved to tears.  
  
"...Elsreine-sama is our guide, descended from the heavenly kingdom to
this world. To save us from this land filled with suffering, they show
us the way forward through these paintings. Only those with pure hearts
can journey to paradise..."  
  
The priests repeatedly conveyed these words to the people.  
  
"The angels of paradise who value simple and modest feasts. Their smiles
will tell you. Without attachment to the worldly possessions of this
mortal realm, they wear thin cloth and simply laugh with those beside
them...filled with the pure innocence of a newborn child, unsullied
figures. Elsreine-sama shows you this, not through words, but through
paintings...the correct form to be welcomed as an angel of paradise."  
  
Elsreine's paintings mostly depicted feasts.  
Scenes of people enjoying meals and tea in nature, surrounded by
grasslands and forests.  
Without gaudy decorations, people clad only in thin cloth sharing fruit
and smiling.  
  
Paradise was said to be a place where only gentle angels lived, never
wanting for food and sharing everything.  
Everyone was selfless and full of compassion, having abandoned the
spirit of conflict, therefore, the world remained unsullied.  
The priest said that paradise is a more beautiful world than they could
imagine.  
  
Those who would have scoffed at mere words could not help but be moved
by the beauty of these paintings.  
It made one think that such a place might truly exist.  
Elsreine's paintings were that realistic.  
  
The "Angel's Gathering," where multiple paintings were regularly
collected and exhibited, drew a large crowd, spreading the teachings.  
Along with the church's distribution of bread to the poor—where the
priests gave sermons—belief in "Reine's Heaven" surprisingly increased
among the poor in Elsreine.  
Now, people gathered at the church not only for bread but to listen to
the sermons, even those outside the cathedral sought to hear the
priest's words.  
  
A man tossed a gold coin into a vessel filled mostly with copper
coins.  
After viewing the paintings, he was not led to the exit but to the
church's inner parlor.  
A priest appeared after a while.  
After some light conversation, the merchant brought up the subject of
donations.  
  
An attendant placed a heavy box on the table and opened it, revealing a
large amount of gold coins.  
The wealthy merchant said he wished to make a donation to the church and
then, as if it were a completely separate matter, began to talk about
the paintings.  
  
What incredibly beautiful paintings.  
If he could see such paintings every day, his faith would deepen.  
However, his busy schedule made it difficult to visit the church
regularly.  
  
The priest listened with a smile, saying, "Your deep faith is evident
here," and glancing at the gold coins, subtly asked which painting he
liked best.  
When the merchant mentioned a specific painting, the priest replied,
"That is one of the most beautiful and popular paintings," and the
merchant murmured, "I see."  
  
Then, as if remembering something, he added, "And this as well," handing
over another pouch of gold coins.  
The priest checked its weight and nodded, saying, "For someone like you,
even Elsreine-sama would approve."  
  
—This is also faith, he said with a smile. 
<br /><br />

  
Many unfinished paintings lined Reine's room.  
  
"As always, wonderful paintings… the people will rejoice,"  
  
Reine lowered her eyes after seeing off Pope Narcor Liveners, who had
taken a painting.  
The Papal Palace visited regularly, requesting paintings for the
church.  
They said that many paintings were needed to guide the people and widely
spread the teachings; that the people would rejoice at seeing them.  
  
Was that really the case? Was the message truly getting across?  
Doubts increasingly clouded Reine's mind, but she clung to painting
paradise.  
A hundred, two hundred.  
More than a thousand, approaching two thousand.  
  
Reine gradually lost her voice in the council, only nodding in agreement
with others.  
Even when she thought something was wrong, she couldn't speak up, only
having Golzarias and the others speak on her behalf. Reine hadn't spoken
in the council for several years.  
  
Reine knew almost nothing about the state of the country.  
At least, the road to the orphanage—Renaria seemed prosperous, but what
about other cities?  
Even Golzarias and the others didn't tell Reine anything, only uttering
vague reassurances like, "Everything is fine."  
  
Reine wanted to believe it, but couldn't.  
Many nobles weren't very clever, often making incomprehensible
suggestions.  
They frequently proposed solutions like answering '3' or '1' to the
question of 'what is 1 + 1?', which meant there must be problems in the
country.  
  
There must be poverty in some regions.  
Unemployment was rising, and security was deteriorating.  
Reine could easily imagine it, yet they were told there were no
problems.  
  
Perhaps Narcor was right, and the people were living more peacefully and
cooperatively than imagined.  
If so, this was the right way, Reine thought.  
However, she felt the possibility of it being otherwise was much
higher.  
  
"Shall I refill your tea?"  
  
Reine nodded, and Fenela poured more tea with a smile.  
Showing concern for Reine, whose talkativeness had decreased
significantly, Fenela spoke brightly.  
It took her half an hour just to talk about the nice weather.  
She laughed happily over trivial things.  
  
"...Fenela, is this country becoming a good country?"  
"Um..."  
"Do you think Liveners is telling the truth? Do you think Reine's
feelings are conveyed through the paintings, and that...is this country
becoming a good country? The policies are inconsistent and strange."  
  
As Reine said this while gazing at the poured tea, Fenela fell silent
for a while.  
  
"Everyone says there are no problems, even though there must be. Is it
Reine who is going crazy for doubting those words? Reine is—"  
  
Fenela then knelt down and gently hugged Reine.  
  
"...Fenela also thinks something's wrong. To be honest...I don't think
the Pope is very trustworthy either..."  
  
She whispered, glancing nervously at the door.  
  
"I feel that Elsreine-sama is being prevented from acting freely. That
also applies to Lukazan-sama, and...Fenela doesn't want to imagine it,
but..."  
"Lukazan...too?"  
"Fenela was always told by Lukazan-sama to report any changes in
Elsreine-sama's condition. At first...I thought he was concerned about
Elsreine-sama, but looking at the current situation, I don't think
that's the case."  
  
Reine gazed at the tea, eyes downcast.  
  
"Every time Elsreine-sama spoke, the nobles would raise their voices,
and Lukazan-sama and the others would often intervene, saying they were
calming the situation...but weren't these discussions happening without
Elsreine's knowledge?"  
"Such discussions…"  
"There's an agreement to oppose any proposal by Elsreine. If this
happens repeatedly, Elsreine-sama will have difficulty speaking up...and
that might be the goal."  
  
Fenela's words matched what Reine had tried not to think about.  
The idea she had repeatedly dismissed as impossible.  
If Golzarias was deceiving Reine, everything fit together.  
  
Golzarias, along with the three dukes.  
Narcor was also chosen by them and had deep ties.  
Golzarias held the western territory, and if the three dukes cooperated,
there would be no one in the country who could oppose them.  
The actual ruler of the country was not Reine but the three dukes.  
  
If that was the goal, the current situation made sense.  
  
*"I have a responsibility for those who died in this war. Those who
mourn their deaths need someone to direct their hatred towards."*  
  
But when did it start?  
Reine didn't want to suspect Golzarias, she wanted to believe in
Golzarias, who had treated her well.  
Perhaps she had simply forgotten that feeling somewhere along the way.  
If so, perhaps if Reine scolded him, Golzarias would change his heart
and start over.  
  
Or maybe Reine simply didn't understand.  
Perhaps, in truth, the country was heading towards a better future in
this form.  
Reine knew nothing right now.  
  
"...I think I should investigate."  
"Investigate...?"  
"Yes. I can't say anything until I investigate...It feels like doubting,
and I don't really want to do it...but if it turns out I was just
overthinking, it will make Reine feel better."  
  
Having decided this, Reine started sneaking out of her room every
night.  
  
Reine began by meticulously examining the information gathered in
Renaria.  
Leaving the room through the window, moving from window to window.  
Reine personally checked, memorized, and gathered information from
documents in various departments, increasing the frequency of visits to
the orphanage, and going out into the city after dark.  
  
Even in the seemingly bustling Renaria, several slums existed, and Reine
easily confirmed the gathering of homeless children.  
Problems were everywhere, none of which Reine had heard about.  
Homeless children stole, thin girls stood on street corners and were
bought by soldiers—supposedly on patrol—and engaged in sexual acts in
alleyways.  
They were beaten for payment, the girls crying for forgiveness, the
soldiers spitting and leaving.  
After a while, the girls would return to the street corner.  
  
Twenty years have passed since the founding of Elsreine.  
Yet, even Renaria had lawless zones, and even the patrols didn't follow
the rules.  
Such sights were common even outside the designated pleasure
districts.  
A far cry from the country Reine envisioned twenty years ago.  
  
At least, this wasn't 'Elsreine'.  
  
A sickening feeling churned in Reine's chest.  
The anxiety that she was being deceived and used was gradually becoming
believable.  
In contrast to such chaos, the church was beautiful.  
It stood in a place with good security—and not cheap land.  
  
Despite not being a noble or merchant's mansion, what was it
protecting?  
The church even had guards at night.  
It would take effort to sneak in, and the ledgers weren't easy to
find.  
However, after checking several churches, Reine found two hidden ledgers
besides the official ones.  
  
Immense monetary income for what was ostensibly donations.  
Most of it was supposedly for lending Reine's paintings, but one ledger
had a strange correlation with the orphanage records—the departure of an
orphaned girl coincided with the sale of a beautiful painting.  
A transaction with a merchant.  
The amount was roughly equal to that of an illegal slave.  
It was just suspicion with one instance, but several similar entries
confirmed it.  
They were undoubtedly selling orphans.  
  
Remembering the smiling faces of the children at the orphanage, Reine's
discomfort grew stronger.  
  
Taking it as evidence, Reine went straight to the Papal Palace after
returning from the orphanage the next day.  
Reine entered Narcor's private residence on the grounds and began
searching for ledgers without hesitation.  
  
In the Pope's study, where Reine's paintings were displayed, books lay
scattered on the floor, several emptied bookshelves lined up.  
The same went for the scattered books, several found ledgers were spread
out on the desk, haphazardly pushed to the side.  
Narcor Liveners was tied to a chair in the middle of the room.  
By the time Narcor rushed over, alarmed by Reine's unauthorized entry,
Reine had already found the hidden ledger.  
  
Most people managed their financial transactions with ledgers, except
for those like Reine's mother and Reine herself, who could manage
everything from memory.  
Unlike the official ledger, carefully balanced to avoid suspicion, the
hidden ledger showed the true state of affairs.  
Illegal transactions and other shady financial dealings were recorded
there, and this was the ledger actually used for calculations.  
  
However, it was something that couldn't be seen by others.  
Simple codes were used that only the writer could understand, and this
was no exception.  
To get him to talk, Narcor's left fingers were already all broken.  
Narcor initially claimed it was a mistake, but seeing that Reine didn't
hesitate to break off his fingers one by one and tie his arm for
severing, he realized that he couldn't fool her.  
Narcor told her about the code.  
  
Then he came.  
  
"Lukazan, what is the meaning of this?"  
"Please calm down, Elsreine-sama."  
  
It was Golzarias Lukazan.  
Reine immediately pointed the sword she had taken from the soldier at
his neck, but Golzarias remained calm, raising his hands.  
His gaze briefly fell on the ledgers spread out on the side table.  
Reine frowned.  
  
"Reine is calm. However, you, like the other two and the nobles
mentioned here, are involved in corruption and have committed crimes. Is
it true that you received donations from Narcor and provided some sort
of favor in return?"  
"Yes, I admit it. However, it seems inappropriate to have such a
conversation with the door open. May I invite you into the room? I won't
run or hide."  
  
Reine cautiously kept her distance, Golzarias removed his sword belt and
placed it on a shelf next to the entrance, doing the same with his
knife.  
He then raised both hands and walked into the room, moving the sofa,
which was also haphazardly pushed to the side, and sat down.  
Then he looked at Narcor and chuckled.  
  
"What's so funny?"  
"Your lack of restraint, I daresay."  
"Depending on the situation, Reine might have to do the same to you."  
"I'd rather not. However...perhaps you would lower your sword? There's
no point for me, unarmed—and an old man at that—to take advantage of
you, Elsreine-sama."  
  
His once-black hair was now gray, his large frame had lost some muscle
since twenty years ago.  
What remained unchanged was his single eye, which stared straight at
Reine.  
  
"You haven't changed, still beautiful. I hear Her Majesty the Queen is
the same. Perhaps the child of God doesn't know aging. Both body and
mind remain beautiful, pure. Including the fact that you are willing to
listen to my story."  
"...Reine remembers what you said before. You...haven't forgotten it,
have you?"  
"Of course not."  
"...Then why do this?"  
  
Golzarias touched his chin and pondered for a moment.  
He chuckled wryly, saying, "It's difficult to say... each statement is
correct, yet each one can be considered wrong. One reason is that I was
genuinely captivated by Elsreine-sama's paintings."  
"...Paintings?"  
"Yes, truly beautiful paintings. I never felt attracted to paintings or
art...but since seeing Elsreine-sama's paintings, I understand their
appeal."  
  
Then, he continued.  
  
"My continued reverence for Elsreine-sama is one reason...and perhaps my
fondness for gambling is another. This current situation isn't a loss
for me."  
"...?"  
"Consider it calmly. Regardless of the truth, or any justification
Elsreine-sama may have had, it would be difficult to legally punish me.
You would simply be considered mad, and that's how the council will
treat it."  
  
Gripping her sword, Reine asked,  
  
"...Did you orchestrate the council's actions as well?"  
"I merely fulfilled Elsreine-sama's ideal."  
"Reine's ideal...?"  
"Yes. After hearing everyone's opinions, this was the inevitable
outcome. For the fattened nobles, Elsreine-sama's desired peaceful and
beautiful paradise was an obstacle. ...I simply summarized that simple
majority vote."  
  
Unable to understand, Reine furrowed her brow in confusion.  
  
"To build a good country together—as you said, this country is good for
'everyone.' Everyone satisfies their desires for themselves, without
being judged...an Elsren different from the Elsren Elsreine dreamed of.
A paradise for them."  
"...What are you saying? This is—"  
"As you can see by looking at those ledgers and facing reality...this is
what was desired, at least in this country. A paradise where they can
enjoy the sweet fruits, with the absolute Alberan, the queen, the child
of God, as a shield, and another child of God as a symbol..."  
  
"Indeed," Golzarias laughed.  
  
"It would be difficult for the pure Elsreine-sama. But...such is
humanity. They use others, everyone desires their own desires first, and
the resulting overlap of such intentions is the collective known as a
nation. ...And this is the Elsren they created together."  
"This...is Elsren?"  
"Yes. I simply listened to their opinions, as per Elsreine-sama's
wishes. Their imagined paradise and Elsreine-sama's differed. In fact,
the commoners believe that Elsreine-sama's Elsren is not of this world,
but a heavenly place, somewhere they are invited to after death...that
they will be rewarded if they endure this painful reality."  
  
"It's a pity," he said, laughing at Narcor, who was frightened and
silent next to him.  
As if to confidently say he was doing the right thing.  
  
"...Is this Elsren also for Lukazan?"  
"That's difficult to say. I don't have any particular discomfort or
dissatisfaction..."  
"Lukazan said that if you could show a place where everyone could live
happily and peacefully, as Reine wished, it would reach Kaasama...that
he would cooperate for that purpose. ...Was that a lie?"  
"As I said, this is a country created by each person's perception of the
Elsren that Elsreine-sama tried to convey...As her first minister, I
still serve Elsreine-sama and strive to build a better Elsren."  
  
She felt sick and her head ached.  
It felt like her words weren't getting through, and she pressed her
forehead, her eyes darting around.  
  
*'It was all caused by a misunderstanding...Mother didn't kill Fili. It
was Lukazan who was there.'*  
  
Then, she remembered those words.  
  
"...Lukazan killed Fili? Were you deceiving Reine from the beginning?"  
  
Golzarias said wearily,  
  
"I believe I mentioned this before. ...Anything can be explained away,
excuses are easy. Words are meaningless. If I answer yes, would
Elsreine-sama kill me here and now? If I answer that it was the Queen's
doing, would you believe me?"  
"That..."  
"Either way, it's in the past. Elsreine-sama suspected the Queen, and
without reading that letter...Elsreine-sama chose that way, ultimately
making her own decision."  
  
With that single eye, directly and without shame, Golzarias always stood
before Reine with a dignified attitude.  
  
"I have always left the choice to you, Elsreine-sama. If the council was
under your control, you could have forced compliance. Why didn't you
just do what you wanted, ignoring our words and not relinquishing your
power? Creating a country like the Queen's should have been easy for
you."  
"..."  
"But you feared the criticism of the nobles, kept silent, stopped making
your own decisions, and left the choice to us. Since it turned out this
way...this is undoubtedly a country born from your choices,
Elsreine-sama."  
  
He then said there were three things she could do from here on out.  
  
"You have time. You can continue to live as you have, hoping that you
will eventually be understood. Or, you can crush and kill the corrupt
nobles by force, and rebuild your country through civil war. Or, you can
believe the Queen you suspected, return to Alberan, and apologize for
what happened."  
  
Counting on his fingers, Golzarias laughed. Reine didn’t understand why
he was laughing. She didn’t understand.  
  
"The first two options would bring misfortune to many. Many people would
die. Of course, this includes the children who finally found happiness
at the orphanage...If you flee to Alberan, they will hate you. They will
think you abandoned and betrayed them."  
  
Her shoulders jumped, and she lowered his eyes.  
She couldn't look at Golzarias's face.  
  
"Many commoners will think so. Those who placed their hopes in the
Elsren you envisioned, even if it was different, will all feel that way.
After considering that, you should make your decision. At least, every
option seems easy for you…for now."  
  
Feeling Golzarias stand up, Reine stepped back, her back hitting the
door.  
Golzarias was then in front of Reine.  
Kneeling, he grasped Reine's sword—its point—and pressed it to his own
neck.  
  
Reine's hand gripping the sword was trembling.  
  
"Just apply a little force, Elsreine-sama. I won't resist. If you order
me to die, I will press this neck to this point myself. ...I am still
your minister, as I swore to be, as long as you need me."  
"..."  
"What are you hesitating about? ...If you think you were deceived by me,
there's only one thing to do, isn't there? If you are angry, just thrust
it. If you hesitate, give your command...I will obey you."  
  
Reine didn't understand how he could do this.  
She couldn't understand.  
Even though he could die with a little force, as he said, he showed no
sign of fear.  
As if he wouldn't be killed.  
As if he believed he was right.  
  
She couldn’t pull back the sword, push it in, or speak.  
She simply released her grip on the sword, letting go.  
  
"...You are truly astonishingly kind."  
  
Taking the sword, he placed it on a shelf.  
Then Golzarias moved slightly away and looked at Reine's painting.  
  
"A truly beautiful painting. Pure and innocent...I think so more and
more as I get older. I am truly grateful to Fili, who taught you so much
and made you paint this. ...I never thought there could be such a
wonderful thing in this world where I only have the pleasure of
gambling."  
  
Taking the frame in his hand, he looked at the happy faces and smiled.  
  
"The inner self conveyed through the painting...this painting is truly
Elsreine-sama. Since I won the gamble of social climbing, this painting
is always what I think of. I've seen almost all your paintings...but I
always look forward to what you'll show me."  
  
"Perhaps we are similar in how we break," he chuckled.  
  
"I felt that people and things were all tools or something. I learned
how to use them deeply, and used them to utilize them without any
hesitation. Of course, I don't have the intellect of you or Her Majesty
the Queen...but I've been broken since birth."  
  
There was no malice in that smile.  
No guilt, just a smile.  
  
"...I might even say that I feel a certain kind of affinity or
admiration for you. You, who can kill people so impassively on the
battlefield, should be far more broken than I am, yet it's amazing that
you can paint such a paradise, that you are so kind, and that's why I
want to know you, isn't it?"  
  
He said, without a blaming tone,  
  
"But you are quite foolish," while maintaining his unchanging smile.  
  
"But I find that foolishness beautiful. You are more beautiful than
anyone I've ever met. The Queen before I met her was probably the same
kind of person. What would it be like if she painted? ...Well, that's
enough of that."  
  
Continuing, he hung the picture back on the wall, and said,  
  
"Whatever this is, it's your choice. Your answer. ...I look forward to
the sequel, Elsreine-sama. My current raison d'être is this painting you
create."  
  
—Please don't stop painting.  
Golzarias continued. 
<br /><br />

  
Elsren Holy Empire, the first emperor, Elsreine, was a beautiful and
benevolent ruler.  
She built Elsren with her brilliant skills, but rarely appeared in
public and never gave speeches.  
Instead, what she showed was a painting of paradise.  
It is said that she guided the people with such a fantastic paradise
where old and young, men and women, share fruit and laugh together.  
  
Past and future unmatched refined technique. The heavenly paradise woven
from the pathological detail and layers of paint. Elsreine's paintings
gradually lost their adult figures, and only children remained.  
  
Except for her last work.  
  
"Elsreine-sama..."  
  
Fenela, waiting in front of the carriage, recognized Reine and ran
towards her.  
She asked anxiously if Reine was alright, and Reine nodded quietly.  
  
She had to conveyed the situation.  
But how should she explain this outcome?  
How should she say it?  
Will she understand?  
Thinking about that, and trying to reassure her, she was about to
answer, “It’s alright,” when  
  
"?..."  
  
She froze, unable to speak.  
Her eyes darted around, confused, she opened and closed her lips trying
to speak, and pressed her throat.  
  
"...Elsreine-sama, something happened to you?"  
  
She shook her head to answer, but no sound came out.  
She tried to speak, but could only exhale.  
Confused, she repeated it several times, trembling with anxiety, and
Fenela asked, seeing this,  
  
"Perhaps your voice...is gone?"  
  
Nodding, Reine's gaze wavered in agitation.  
Fenela stared blankly at Reine, her face contorted as she shook her
head.  
Then, she hugged Reine,  
  
"...It's alright..."  
  
In a trembling voice, she said, "Please don't push yourself."
