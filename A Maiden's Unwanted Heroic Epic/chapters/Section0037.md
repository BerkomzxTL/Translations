## Chapter 347: Charm VI

Bogan, like the Royal Prince, seemed to have come directly from the
battlefield to the capital for the victory ceremony.  
After hearing the story, he said he wanted to take care of everything
himself and settled all matters within a few days.  
He came to pick up Lazura and Bery, who had been waiting anxiously at
the inn, and then they rode together in a carriage.  
They spoke again inside the carriage.  
  
"—It's settled that I will pay off the Argan family's debts."  
"That's..."  
"Don't worry about it. You might not know, but... I've worked quite a
lot on the battlefield since then. I'm now a legion commander... I've
been granted the title of count and appointed as acting Northern
General, in charge of the northern army. 'Acting' is just a matter of
age... If I perform well without major failures, I'll eventually be
appointed Northern General and receive the title of Marquis of the
Marches."  
  
Lazura's eyes widened, and Bogan, sitting opposite her in the carriage,
smiled.  
  
"I've also been entrusted with rich territories to govern. There might
be some difficulties for a while... but once you get used to life on the
battlefield, a roof and a bed are enough. Ideally, I wouldn't want to
rely on them, but I have subordinates who will offer help when they hear
about the situation. So, please trust me and leave it to me."  
"But, that much..."  
"I heard that the first head of the Argan family… my grandfather
received a lot of favors from them. There are those circumstances, and
both my father and I were indebted to your father. Neither my father nor
my grandfather would overlook you staying in such a place... And more
than anything, I feel the same way."  
  
He nodded, telling her to relax.  
With eyes and a voice filled with unwavering kindness.  
  
"My mother also passed away while I was at war, and I dismissed the
servants. I'm alone at the mansion in Gurgain. That's why I came
straight from the battlefield to the capital. ...It's more peaceful for
me to have two guests than to be alone."  
  
Then Bogan turned to Bery.  
  
"I have no intention of doing anything to you or your sister. For now,
will you trust me?"  
"...Yes."  
  
Her sister, who had been looking at Bogan with a somewhat cold gaze,
answered quietly, and Lazura gently stroked her head.  
She thought Bery was being wary.  
It was probably due to the days they had spent.  
  
Lazura's heart was filled with relief and unexpected joy, and she had no
room to worry about her sister.  
She couldn't even sense the feelings of a sister who felt betrayed.  
  
"I apologize for the mansion having no servants... but please rest at
the mansion for a while. I'll take care of some errands, then return to
the capital once to attend the victory ceremony. We'll talk about what
to do next, including everything else, once I return."  
"...Understood."  
"Well then, see you later."  
  
He then exited the carriage and went to the horse outside.  
Lazura simply shed tears of relief and joy, holding Bery. 
<br /><br />

  
After the war, Bogan's exploits seemed to have reached Gurgain, and the
town gardeners had voluntarily tended to the garden, but of course, with
no master or servants present, they couldn't enter the house.  
The mansion, neglected for a long time, was covered in dust and in
terrible condition.  
Nozan, who had returned with them, brought a few capable servants from
his house, and they all cleaned together.  
  
"It's good sometimes," Lazura said, taking up a rag herself. Along with
Bogan, she helped clean while watching Bery. That evening, the mansion
was clean.  
  
Some of the furnishings, like paintings, were to be sold in the capital,
so the mansion had become sparse.  
A slightly lonely expression came to her mind, and unable to sleep, she
slipped out of the bed where Bery was sleeping, wanting to express her
gratitude again, and went to Bogan's room.  
He wasn't in his private room; but the reception.  
  
Above the fireplace was a magnificent sword.  
The Christand family had a short history, with almost no treasures.  
The longsword held by the opponent his grandfather—the first head of the
family—had defeated was said to be their only family heirloom.  
She had heard such a story from him before.  
He had laughed while telling Lazura, who was sulking after being scolded
for playing a prank, that he had a similar experience.  
  
He had apparently secretly pulled out and swung the family heirloom
sword, only to have his father take it away and hit him.  
His father had said that treating a noble warrior's sword as a toy was
absolutely unforgivable.  
Bogan had sulked, asking why he had to be hit for it, but his
grandfather, who learned of the story later, had laughed and said:  
*"One wrong step and it wouldn't have just been a nosebleed. You handled
a blade meant to kill people so lightly without preparation. That's why
you were scolded so severely."*  
  
*"Of course, there might be bad parents, but your father is a
respectable man. He wouldn't get angry without reason. He only scolded
you strongly because he thought overlooking your slight prank would not
be good for your future. ...However, if you still think that scolding
was truly unreasonable when we meet next, then you can tell me. As a
noble, as your ally, I will advise your father that it was excessive
scolding."*  
  
Bogan didn't blame Lazura, but he said so in a serious tone.  
When he so boldly declared himself her ally, she couldn't maintain her
foolish stubbornness.  
If his seemingly strict father learned that the head of another family
was advising his child, it would be a serious matter.  
"Not that far," Lazura said, flustered, but he grandly threatened that
if she truly believed it was unreasonable, he would have to side with
her, and she couldn't help but admit she had done many wrong things
herself.  
The treasured heirloom sword appeared in such a small, memorable
story.  
  
In the reception room, lit only by moonlight, Bogan stood, holding such
a sword in both hands, gazing at it quietly.  
  
"Um, Bogan-sama... that sword is—"  
"It's a good sword, after all. There are some nicks, but it would fetch
a good price."  
"But, that's... the Christand family's—"  
"Don't worry about it. ...Aside from the reward money from His Majesty,
I can't simply sell treasures or newly bestowed swords. I want to settle
all payments in one go, without any lingering issues with those people,
and borrowing from Nozan and his group is a last resort. ...Besides, a
thing is just a thing."  
  
"A thing is just a thing"—the weight of those words clutched at her
chest.  
It surely wasn't something that could be seen that way.  
  
She didn't think there was any need to pay in one lump sum.  
The Christand family, having been granted rich territories to govern,
would have been able to comfortably pay, even with interest. She didn't
believe Roland would charge exorbitant interest to Bogan, who would be
overseeing the northern army.  
Yet, his insistence on a lump sum was probably for Lazura and her
sister's sake.  
It was a considerate gesture, so they wouldn't have to remember the debt
with each payment, so that everything was truly over and they could
embark on a new life.  
  
"My grandfather defeated Elsren's legion commander. We raided their
encampment, but our legion commander was also slain, and it turned into
a chaotic battle, though we had the advantage in situation and numbers.
He was said to be an astonishingly fierce warrior, wielding a great
spear with ease, but even unlimited stamina eventually runs out. His
strong guards fell one by one, and he was surrounded... but even when he
was alone, he fought on."  
  
"The battlefield is a strange place, I think," he said.  
  
"It was a situation where we could have killed him instantly with bows,
without any casualties. But everyone there showed him undeniable
respect. It might seem foolish, but gripping their swords, they declared
their names and challenged him, and many were cut down in return—my
grandfather, who was a centurion, also ended up challenging him."  
  
He gazed at the steel, then closed his eyes.  
  
"The man's body was at its limit... he stood only by sheer will. It felt
like he would die if we waited longer, but my grandfather believed no
trickery should be used and went head-on. ...Sacrificing his left arm,
he closed the distance and tried to push him down, but the man was like
a rock. Enduring that, he let go of his spear and drew this sword. My
grandfather, realizing his own death, delivered a desperate blow... but
before the man's sword, which would have been fatal, my grandfather's
blade pierced him."  
  
Bogan sheathed the sword.  
He carefully placed it back above the fireplace.  
  
"He apparently said with a laugh, 'I have received your farewell gift,
you may take it as your reward.' After that, this sword came to be
treated as a great warrior's sword, the Christand family's heirloom...
but my grandfather told me at my coming of age that 'this sword itself
has no meaning.'"  
"Meaning..."  
"He said that what he truly received was not this sword, but that
warrior's name and pride. This sword is merely a tool to remember and
not forget that. The important things are within one's heart, and any
object is merely a mirror to reflect oneself."  
  
Then, he turned to Lazura, smiled, and said,  
  
"I believe that is correct, and I simply act on it. My grandfather would
not be stingy with objects. And my grandfather's name and pride... those
teachings, I will not forget, even without a mirror. Yes, I swore just
now. You'll worry even if I tell you not to... but it's nothing
significant."  
"But..."  
  
As Lazura lowered her eyes, Bogan quietly continued.  
  
"It's enough if you just look towards the future."  
"...'Future' means, well,"  
"Since I've paid off the Argan family's debts, you probably can't help
but feel that it's not an equal relationship. You'll try to repay the
debt of gratitude, and for example, if I were to say now that I want to
take you... well, as my wife, I think you wouldn't have any room to
consider it."  
  
Slightly embarrassed, he said, "I don't like that kind of
relationship."  
  
"You and I have known each other for a long time... but in terms of
actual time spent, it's short, and it's been quite a while since we last
met. Honestly, I don't know you well enough to say I love you as a
woman, and you probably don't know me well enough to want to spend your
life with me. ...So for now, as my guest, until this matter truly
becomes a past event for you... then I want you to decide what you want
to do next."  
  
He truly was the wonderful person she had admired.  
Even as a respectable warrior, he was still the same as she remembered
him from childhood; those aspects hadn't changed.  
  
"Can... can I... be enough? I... am—"  
  
She was no longer pristine, and she was mismatched with him, now a
respectable warrior.  
If he were to take her as his wife, he would surely hear words that
didn't need to be heard and be looked at with gazes that didn't need to
be felt.  
There probably wasn't a noble in the north who didn't know what had
happened to the Argan family, and in the capital, not a few people knew
her from when she sold flowers.  
  
"You are more beautiful than anyone. As a noble, as an older sister...
you simply fulfilled your duties and protected them. Your nobility
cannot be defiled by anything, and no matter what anyone says, I respect
you. ...I think you would be the best woman to take as a wife, but
precisely because of that, if I am to take you, I want to build a new
relationship without any unnecessary circumstances."  
  
When asked "How about it?", she wiped her eyes and nodded, "Yes."  
  
"If... I am acceptable."  
"Then it's fine. Let the past be the past... remembering only memories
is enough. From now on, let's talk about the future. If we can truly do
that someday... I want to talk to you again."  
  
Bogan smiled and touched Lazura's head.  
Lazura also smiled quietly, leaning into him just a little.  
  
"You helped with a big cleanup after a long journey... You must be quite
tired today. It's late now, get some good rest."  
  
She nodded, said her thanks, and headed towards her room.  
Her sister, who should have been sleeping in bed, was not there, and the
balcony door was open.  
  
A slightly cool air.  
The night sky was beautiful, stars sparkled, and the full moon
illuminated the world.  
The girl, with her back to her, held her hand up to the moon.  
Her long hair danced in the passing breeze, and her thin nightgown
billowed gently.  
Her red hair mingled with the indigo of the night, shining as if
translucent in the moonlight.  
  
"Beautiful."  
  
Was it directed at the night sky, or at her sister?  
She simply smiled, thinking it was like a painting.  
  
"...Yes. But, I can't reach it."  
  
Lazura gave a wry smile at Bery, who simply stated what she saw.  
  
"I feel like it's been a while since I heard you speak like a child."  
  
It was truly a beautiful sky.  
She narrowed her eyes slightly in the cool night air, thinking it was
like a different world.  
Come to think of it, she hadn't looked up at the night sky recently.  
Walking beside Bery, she touched the railing and looked up at the sky in
the same way.  
  
"He's a wonderful person, isn't he?"  
"...Did you hear?"  
"A little."  
  
Bery slowly lowered the hand she had held up as if reaching for the
moon.  
  
"...I think he's a good match for you, Nee-sama."  
  
A voice that seemed to melt into the stillness of the night.  
When Lazura looked at Bery, whose cheeks were flushed, her sister gave a
faint smile.  
There was no more hatred in her eyes; like clear amber, there was a
quiet glow in the moonlight.  
  
"It's been a long time since I saw you genuinely smile."  
  
When Lazura reached out, Bery quietly pressed her cheek against Lazura's
hand.  
Her long eyelashes narrowed, enveloping her light brown eyes, and she
gently placed her own hand over Lazura's, then slowly closed her eyes.  
  
"This happiness is what you gave me, Bery. ...That's what I believe."  
  
She said, tracing Bery's soft lips with her thumb.  
  
"...Will you stay by my side from now on?"  
  
Bery, opening her eyes again, took Lazura's hand.  
  
"As long as Nee-sama needs me."  
  
And kissed the back of her hand.  
She presented it with a respectful, dignified, and beautiful gesture.  
  
She thought it was a gentle sign of farewell.  
The most distant kiss, a forgiveness for the sister who had broken their
contract.  
  
―The next day, Bery cut off her long hair and bowed her head before
Bogan.  
  
"I am immature, and my work may be insufficient. But... if it pleases
you, please let me stay here as a servant."  
"...It will take some time to hire servants. During that time, I would,
of course, be happy for you to do work around the mansion... but I
intend to welcome you both as guests. You are still young, and I hear
your body is not strong. I understand your feelings, but please don't
overexert yourself—"  
"Please. ...As a noble, I ask."  
  
Seeing Bogan's troubled expression, Lazura nodded.  
Her beautifully tended hair was neatly gone. Lazura, who had been
elated, finally understood how deeply she had hurt her sister.  
  
She had rejected and discarded Bery's pride and her desperate, hateful
love, for happiness.  
The two separate entities would surely never become one again.  
And Lazura would never again wish for them to be so.  
  
Yet, they were sisters.  
It was Lazura, and no one else, who had cast that curse upon her
sister.  
  
Forever separated, yet cruelly close, never to part. 
<br /><br />

  
Bery clearly drew a line and no longer crossed it.  
Lazura only said, "What a waste."  
Bery replied, "It gets in the way of working," and that was that.  
From some perspectives, it might have been seen as a slight against a
traitor.  
But Lazura believed it was different.  
  
What Bery had discarded along with her long hair was her own
happiness.  
She had simply let go of the radiant glow she had desired in that dark
world, so she would never crave it again.  
Unlike Lazura, who was welcomed back into the bright sunlight, Bery
remained in the twilight.  
  
The clinging gaze disappeared, and Lazura's feet moved lightly.  
It had been a burden, but without it, her heart would have broken.  
However, in a happy world, her sister's love was too heavy, and Lazura
would have felt suffocated.  
She believed it was indeed Bery's forgiveness for her.  
  
For example, like a mother and a stepmother, there must have been a form
of happiness that involved spending time with one person, and given the
circumstances, it was natural.  
She thought about suggesting it when Bery got older, but she never
did.  
  
"You've grown quite a bit taller, haven't you? Do your heels hurt?"  
"Just a little... but not enough to worry about."  
  
Two years after coming to Gurgain—in Lazura's room.  
For her sister, it seemed as if time, which had truly stopped since
leaving the mansion, had started moving again.  
Her height had increased rapidly, and her body had gained a slight,
feminine fullness.  
There were days when she felt a bit unwell, but lately, she hadn't been
confined to bed.  
Except when sleeping, she wore an apron dress at all times.  
It felt unfitting for a child, yet on Bery, it looked strangely
perfect.  
When Lazura wore similar clothes at the same age, she surely didn't look
like that at all.  
  
At first, Lazura helped her sister with various tasks, but lately, she
had been gently told not to interfere unnecessarily, and the mansion's
affairs were left entirely to Bery.  
It was probably good that Bogan had introduced her to specialized books
on physical enhancement, and she had learned a lot.  
It was like giving a giant a club.  
Bery was so omnipresent it was as if the one sister was actually three;
Lazura would think Bery was in the kitchen, only to find her in the
orchard, or hanging laundry.  
In the morning, the mansion lights would mysteriously turn on, and at
night, they would turn off on their own.  
When the lights suddenly went out in the middle of the night, Lazura
almost lost her composure.  
  
"If you're not feeling well, tell me. It's the time for your body to
grow and mature. I also felt unwell when I was your age... Don't overdo
it."  
"...Yes."  
  
Lazura's height was five shaku and one sun.  
She was a bit short, and it seemed Bery would soon surpass her at this
rate.  
Her mother was also petite, and her stepmother, in comparison, was a bit
taller with a more feminine physique.  
Bery would surely grow into a great beauty.  
Now, Lazura could genuinely be happy about her sister becoming
beautiful.  
  
"Fufu, if you keep growing at this rate, I'll be looking up at you,
won't I? If you, my younger sister, try to pat my head, I'll get angry.
That's a privilege for superiors."  
"I might be your superior then..."  
"...Don't be so picky."  
"Fufu, I'm becoming the Nee-sama."  
  
A soft, beautiful smile.  
Lazura glared, pulling Bery's smooth cheek, then suddenly, she too
laughed.  
  
"You're a rude child, was my upbringing bad?"  
"I didn't have the opportunity to see an example of good manners... I
apologize. I'll study from now on."  
"I'll pull it even more, until it doesn't go back."  
"That would be a bit troublesome."  
  
Giggling, she quietly shook her shoulders.  
Even now, Bery didn't open her heart to others.  
But when they were alone, she could even make jokes, like perfectly
normal, close sisters.  
A perfectly normal relationship.  
It was the future Lazura had wanted to see, a happiness she wished would
last forever.  
She thought it was a wonderful, ideal relationship.  
  
However, that happiness existed only because they maintained an
invisible, paper-thin wall between them.  
  
Her sister had confined herself to the form Lazura desired of her.  
The heavy, sticky, clinging love that had pulled Lazura in, as if she
would be swallowed if she touched it, was now beyond that boundary.  
When she caressed Bery's cheek, it was smooth—she couldn't feel the
warmth within her as before.  
  
If she pushed just a little further, she would clearly see beyond the
wall.  
As long as she didn't, her sister wouldn't let her see beyond the wall
either.  
But Lazura wouldn't push.  
And Bery, she surely wouldn't forgive her this time.  
  
Their happiness existed precisely because they respected that
boundary.  
Lazura didn't think her sister was unhappy, but she also felt she wasn't
truly fulfilled.  
Bery would probably look for a reason to disappear from here and
leave.  
Lazura's desire to prevent that was probably her own selfishness.  
  
Just beyond the thin wall, she could faintly feel a heavy presence.  
Lazura herself was obsessed with her sister's love, like an attachment,
and couldn't bear to let it go.  
In those moments when she was sustained by her sister's love, they
melted together, fused.  
A part of Lazura became Bery, and a part of her sister became Lazura.  
  
She thought they had touched too closely.  
That's why, to simply be close sisters, they had to draw a line, and
even the affection they showed each other felt like it had to be
questioned, probed, to ensure it was truly sisterly affection.  
Even simple, honest contact became something to be careful about.  
  
It was annoying, and they both probably wished they could just be far
apart in some corner of their hearts.  
But more than that, they cherished each other too much to part.  
Yet, her sister tried to leave, and her older sister didn't want that.  
  
If chased, she would distance herself; if distanced, she would chase.  
They wished to live that way, separated by a thin sheet of paper.  
  
She hoped that someone who loved her sister more than Lazura did would
appear someday.  
But until then, she probably couldn't let her sister go.  
  
That almost hateful affection was comforting and dear.  
  
"Bery, your Onee-sama is sleepy. Become my stuffed animal."  
"...Nee-sama, I, um, still have things to do."  
"You're still only half a servant, Bery. Do you think a servant has
anything more important than her master's command?"  
"Why don't you say such things after you're officially married? I'm
merely the head of the household's servant, and you, Nee-sama, are still
a guest... I mean—"  
  
Lazura lifted Bery, sat her on the bed, and took off her shoes.  
  
"The ceremony is soon, so it's fine, isn't it? If you put it that way,
then it's a command from your guest and sister, Bery. Don't quibble."  
"I think you're the one quibbling, Nee-sama..."  
"Will you obey my command? Or not?"  
  
With a sigh, her sister got into bed, and Lazura laughed, caressing her
cheek.  
Then, she gently stroked Bery's lips with her thumb and said,  
  
"A spell that prevents you from complaining. See? Bery will gradually
want to become a stuffed animal."  
  
Bery looked at Lazura as if wanting to complain a little, then
relaxed.  
  
"Don't ever think you can win against your Onee-sama with words, Bery.
Even if you're right or whatever, your Onee-sama doesn't care. Your
Onee-sama does what she wants."  
"...Don't you feel ashamed when you hear your own words?"  
"Of course not. Bogan said it too, didn't he? In the end, winning the
battle is what matters. You should remember that if you're a Christand
family servant. ...Now, stuffed animals don't complain."  
  
She commanded her sighing sister not to sigh, and hugged her.  
Soft, snuggling close, she stroked her sister's hair.  
It was no longer long enough for Lazura to tend to it, and it was
light.  
  
For example, if she wished to spend her life as the wife of a wonderful
person, her sister would have accepted.  
But he, so full of radiance, probably couldn't reach the dark parts of
her sister.  
She felt Bery lacked Lazura's weakness and wouldn't be captivated by
it.  
Her sister, like Lazura herself, wouldn't be satisfied without a
self-sacrificing love.  
  
And Lazura herself lacked the capacity to accept her sister's love.  
Yet, she still wished for Bery to be her sister, and to love her.  
  
"I love you, Bery."  
  
A spell for her sister.  
Small curses accumulating.  
Knowing it, yet speaking it unconsciously,  
  
"...Yes, Nee-sama."  
  
Confirming the presence of love just beyond the thin wall.  
  
Love was a curse and an obsession.  
For Lazura, and for her sister too.  
Light shining on the dark parts, and shadowing the bright parts.  
Love deepened to the point of annoyance, and obsession grew to the point
of aversion.  
At least for Lazura, sisterly love was like that, and probably for Bery
too.  
  
She felt happiness from the bottom of her heart at Bogan's radiant love,
and relief from the bottom of her heart at Bery's love in the
darkness.  
Having grown up receiving everything as if entitled, she was probably
quite greedy and sly.  
Not as noble as Bogan thought, nor as pure as Bery thought.  
Just to be that kind of person, Lazura continued to curse her sister.  
  
"You are my treasure."  
  
Forever separated, yet cruelly close, never to be released.  
Saying so out of obsession,  
  
"...Good night, Bery."  
  
She whispered with the love mixed in, and closed her eyes.  
She hoped that someday, she would have a wonderful encounter that would
awaken her from such a dream.  
  
Half curse, half prayer.  
Lazura alone could not fulfill even a single wish.
