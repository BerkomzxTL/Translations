## Chapter 363: New Series! Maid Princess from Another World!

*AN:*  
*The male-to-female ratio is an astonishing 9:1.*  
*Despite claiming to be a yuri novel, what permeated was blood, sweat,
and the stench of men.*  
*That was the story of a maiden's unwanted heroic epic.*  
  
*Being a novelist is a continuous struggle.*  
*Even the words written shift with minor mood swings, and though
intending to write about a girl, before I knew it I ended up writing
about old men. Such things happened often.*  
*The "o(^\_^)o Yuri Yuri Flirting Space o(^\_^)o" I intended to depict
somehow turned into a "(\>\_\<) Battlefield Filled With Insults
(\>\_\<)," then changed to "(-\_-;) An Old Man's Anguish (;-\_-)". And
if I let my guard down, thinking "it's just a side story, so it's fine,"
before I knew it, it was full of old men.*  
  
*Each time, I ponder the choice: which to choose?*  
*Yuri or old men, the scales are always shifting.*  
*Then, a mysterious obsession, which should be called a hobby, like
"realism" or whatever, gets added, and an old man protagonist is
born.*  
*The light of yuri that shone in this work is being sucked into what
should be called an old man black hole, and is about to perish right
now.*  
  
*The event horizon is right before my eyes.*  
*Perhaps yuri flowers will never bloom abundantly in this world
again.*  
*In what should have been a spring world full of chirping birds, gentle
rain, and rainbows, a horrific future awaited. A world in its death
throes, resounding screams, and a downpour of blood, sweat, and
excrement.*  
  
*—However, it can still be saved.*  
*As the author, I firmly believe that.*  
*By abandoning a world contaminated by old men and heading towards a new
paradise where girls can spend their days woof-woofing, meow-meowing,
nom-noming, purring, lazing, and flirting.*  
  
*Those with good intuition will have realized it by now, given what I've
said.*  
*Yes, an isekai reincarnation... (omitted)*

***New series! Maid Princess from Another World! Final Episode: The Evil
Dragon's Millefeuille Cutlet*** 
<br /><br />

It was in a corner of the mansion's large pumpkin patch.  
A small, silver-haired servant was squatting in the corner of the
field.  
  
"Krische-sama, is something wrong?"  
"There's a strange hole here."  
"A hole... Ah, the space does seem a bit warped."  
  
An equally petite red-haired servant squatted beside her, tilting her
head at the slight distortion in space.  
It was a subtle distortion, as if the other side was wavering.  
  
"Hmm, it looks like it'll close on its own if we leave it."  
  
She extended both hands towards the distortion, pulling the space open
with a soft squish.  
  
—Unbeknownst to them, it was the beginning of an adventure to save the
world. 
<br /><br />

  
***Chapter 1: The Hero's Advent*** 
<br /><br />

The Yulin Grand Temple, located in the royal capital of the Tautoki
Kingdom.  
Countless lights swirled within a dome-shaped space large enough to
house an entire mansion.  
On the high ceiling, the sun and moon were depicted, along with the
goddess Yulin, said to rule the world. The surrounding walls were
covered seamlessly with elegant sculptures depicting the kingdom's
founding myth.  
On the flagstone floor, waterways shaped like the six-petaled Aena
flower, the kingdom's crest, were laid out, and a robed spellcaster sat
on each petal.  
Around them, other spellcasters knelt, exhausted, or lay collapsed.  
  
At the center, seemingly the core of this ritual, was a beautiful
girl.  
Her graceful golden hair flowed, and she wore a beautiful white dress.  
With a deep frown etched between her brows, she raised both hands, her
dignified blue eyes staring at a black distortion in the air as if
glaring at it.  
  
"Princess, any more and—"  
  
One of the kneeling spellcasters gasped.  
The ritual had begun yesterday at sunset, but dawn had long since
passed, and the sun was now descending from its zenith.  
It was a grand ritual, gathering mages from across the kingdom.  
They had done their utmost, and some had already lost consciousness from
exhaustion and magical overload.  
Resignation permeated the faces of many present.  
  
"Not yet, we must not give up...!"  
  
The ritual being performed was the Hero Summoning.  
A national-level ritual magic to summon a powerful soul from another
world.  
It was her duty, a task she had to accomplish at all costs to save the
kingdom—and the world.  
Princess Lilybell's eyes still held an unwavering gleam.  
A tenacious resolve resided within them, a refusal to give up even if it
meant burning her very life force.  
  
The hole in space connecting to another world.  
She felt it was almost there.  
But just as the hole was about to open, the spatial distortion began to
close with unusual force.  
  
"...A world with such power. Surely, a hero will appear to save us. If
we are still one step short, I will offer even this soul."  
"No, Princess...!"  
  
It was said that while they could not choose which world to connect to,
the greater the resistance, the more powerful the summoned hero would
be.  
There had never been an instance where the ritual had lasted this
long.  
That's why, without a doubt, a powerful hero would appear.  
That hero would surely save this world from destruction.  
  
"I will decide it with the next one. Those who do not wish me to die,
step forward."  
  
At the princess's resonating voice, one of the kneeling mages stood
up.  
The old man with a long white beard was the Great Sage, Yaquai.  
  
"...It is my life, that of an old man, that should be offered first,
wouldn't it be?"  
"Yaquai..."  
  
At the sight of the old man tottering onto the petal, those who had been
heavily breathing and kneeling also stood up.  
Any more and people would die.  
They understood, but they couldn't stop it.  
If they missed this chance, the next ritual wouldn't be possible for
decades—and by then, they didn't think the kingdom would still exist.  
  
"..., I will proceed."  
  
Everyone nodded at the princess's dignified voice, which suppressed
various emotions.  
The light intensified, as if absorbing the souls of the spellcasters and
shining brighter.  
Lilybell closed her eyes and chanted a spell.  
  
"Come from the otherworld, O Hero. To my call—"  
*"Oh, there are lots of people here, Bery."*  
"...!"  
  
She opened her eyes wide at the voice.  
Pushing the distortion in space apart, a beautiful girl peeked out.  
Long silver hair and an apron dress—a maid, or something similar.  
  
*"Goodness..."*  
  
Behind her, a red-haired girl looked surprised.  
She was also wearing an apron dress.  
Beyond them was what looked like a field—a landscape from another
world.  
  
*"Krische-sama, it'd be bad to bother them, so should we close it?"*  
*"That's right. Well then, excuse us—"*  
"—Wait!"  
  
Lilybell immediately called out, kneeling.  
Then, using the power of a magic tool, the Ring of Dialogue, she spoke
in the language of the other world.  
  
*"I am Lilybell, the First Princess of the Tautoki Kingdom. O Hero...
please, lend me your ear."*  
*"Oh, she's speaking our language. ...Bery, what should we do?"*  
*"Umm..."*  
*"Please, I beg you. Just to hear my story... please."*  
  
With tears welling in her eyes, she looked up, and the red-haired girl
scratched her cheek in a troubled manner.  
"It can't be helped, I suppose," she said, widening the hole and
stepping through to this side.  
The mages sighed in relief and then collapsed one after another. The
red-haired girl looked confused, while the silver-haired girl looked
around with a slightly surprised "Whoa."  
  
Lilybell was also affected, but she couldn't collapse now.  
  
"—Show me the power of these individuals."  
  
As she spoke, information about the two appeared in her mind.  
  
―――――――――――――――――――  
Krische Alberina Christand  
Class: Maid Princess  
Level: ——  
Unique Ability: Eternal Apprentice Maid (Mythic Rank)  
―――――――――――――――――――  
  
Krische, the silver-haired girl, was an ordinary person whose level
wasn't even displayed.  
She felt a slight disappointment.  
"Maid Princess"—a strange class she couldn't understand.  
Since she was called a "Princess," she was probably of noble birth, but
what did "Maid" mean?  
  
The unique ability "Eternal Apprentice Maid" was also
incomprehensible.  
The rank displayed was "Mythic Rank"—a high rank she had never seen
before, yet it was accompanied by no level and "apprentice maid."  
Regardless, it couldn't be an ability indicating strength.  
  
"!"  
  
However, she was surprised when she saw the red-haired girl.  
  
―――――――――――――――――――  
Bery Argan  
Class: Royal Maid  
Level: 327  
Unique Ability: Maid's Refinement (Special Rank)  
―――――――――――――――――――  
  
Beyond imagination.  
A level of 10 was enough for an excellent soldier, and 50 made one of
the continent's foremost warriors.  
In contrast, 327 was an incomprehensibly high level.  
The sheer number left Lilybell speechless.  
  
*"Um...?"*  
  
At the troubled voice of the red-haired girl, Bery, Lilybell snapped
back to attention.  
  
*"...O Hero."*  
*"H-hero...?"*  
*"Please, I beg of you. Save this country... no, save this world...!"*  
  
And then she bowed deeply. 
<br /><br />

  
The Goddess of Light, Yulin, and the Goddess of Darkness, Galra.  
This world was born from the chaos of these twin goddesses.  
Currently, the world was maintained by the balance of light and
darkness, but in the past, when that balance was disrupted, unimaginable
disasters swept across the world.  
Great earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and devastating storms
that scoured the land.  
The people of light and darkness living in this land were once at odds
with each other, but the many calamities spoken of in history led both
to walk the path of harmony.  
  
However, in recent years, the Dark Evil Dragon Ojiros, who had been in a
thousand-year slumber, had revived.  
The dragons, with the revival of their ruling king, expanded their
power. Nearby villages and towns were burned, and recently, dragons had
begun appearing around the capital.  
If Ojiros and the dragons continue to expand their habitat, not only the
kingdom will be destroyed.  
If kingdoms and other countries with many people of light are destroyed,
the world will heavily tilt towards darkness, and unprecedented natural
disasters will strike the world.  
That meant the collapse of the world.  
  
Thus, a hero from another world was summoned.  
One who possesses a neutral attribute, neither light nor dark, and
possesses immense power or incredible talent.  
This world had summoned heroes and borrowed their power every time it
faced the threat of destruction.  
Some were even people who had never fought before, but if trained, they
grew at an astonishing rate, gaining the power to become a hero.  
  
The good fortune this time was that the appearing hero had an
extraordinary level of 327.  
In this situation where even time for training was precious, the
appearance of such a hero could only be attributed to the blessing of
the Goddess of Light, Yulin.  
  
Although the hero initially showed reluctance, hearing that it was not a
conflict between humans but against dragons and beasts seemed to ease
her mind, and she ultimately agreed to help.  
Apparently, from what they heard, she had been living a reclusive life
away from the secular world with close companions, which was likely the
reason for her initial hesitation.  
Someone with her power—surely every authority figure would have sought
out such a force.  
Imagining it, her feelings were easily understood.  
  
Lilybell repeatedly bowed her head for taking away her peaceful life,
but Bery shook her head and smiled, saying that she understood the
circumstances.  
A wonderful hero, possessing both strength and character.  
The only problem was that she was excessively humble.  
She often questioned if she was truly worthy of being a hero, or if it
was some mistake, which caused a minor commotion.  
  
"Um... is this distance alright?"  
"This distance, you mean?"  
  
In the kingdom's training grounds, about three ken apart, Yuri, the
black-haired captain of the Royal Knights, faced the hero.  
Unlike the petite red-haired hero, Yuri was tall for a woman.  
Her hair, tied high, swayed as she wore a questioning look on her
dignified face.  
Opposite her, the red-haired hero, Bery, showed confusion on her own
lovely beautiful face.  
  
The cause of this situation was Bery, who continued to be humble.  
Perhaps to uplift her apparent princess, Krische, she repeatedly said
things like, *"The hero is probably Krische-sama..."*  
  
Level is a metric that defines strength, established by the goddess.  
Initially, Yuri agreed with Lilybell, who stated there was no mistake,
but Bery's humility was excessive.  
Bery's claim that the level-less Krische was the hero did not seem to be
intended as teasing; she seemed to be saying it sincerely.  
  
The hero summoned by such a grand ritual.  
Unlike Lilybell, who had no doubts about her abilities, it was Captain
Yuri of the Royal Knights who voiced a question.  
She stated that she didn't feel the immense magical power a powerful
warrior should possess.  
Moreover, her class was Royal Maid.  
—A Maid.  
  
A class that seemed entirely unsuitable for combat.  
She apparently thought that the concept of "level" itself might be
vastly different between their worlds.  
In their world, level was an absolute indicator of strength.  
However, she wondered if Bery's level was an expression of her strength
as a maid.  
  
This interpretation suggested that a maid's level of 100, for example,
was equivalent to a warrior's level of 10.  
If so, the abnormal figure of 327 became more understandable.  
  
Princess Krische said, "Bery can do anything, and she's good with a
sword," while Bery herself said, "Swordsmanship is just a hobby."  
The incomprehensible unique ability, *Maid's Refinement (Special
Rank)*.  
Yuri stated that a single spar would clarify everything, leading to this
situation.  
  
Bery initially said, "In that case, let's start with Krische-sama," but
she looked troubled when Yuri told her that she was being too
disrespectful.  
Apparently, she also had doubts about the chosen distance.  
  
"If the Hero desires it, I do not mind closing the distance... I am
prepared to fight with magic swords or purely with sword skills."  
"Magic swords... no, if Yuri-sama says it's fine like this."  
  
Lilybell asked Krische, who was eating a cookie and watching from beside
her.  
  
"Um, what is the Hero...?"  
"She said the distance is too close for a match. Do people here not use
body reinforcement, even though they have a lot of magic?"  
"...Too close for a match? Body reinforcement, do you mean enhancing the
body?"  
  
When Krische nodded, Lilybell replied,  
  
"Yuri is a Magic Warrior. She is more skilled than anyone in the art of
body enhancement, but..."  
"Is the fundamental way magic is used different...?"  
"Fundamentally...?"  
  
Lilybell frowned.  
In front of the two, Yuri, facing the hero three ken away, held her
sword at her chest.  
  
"Then... O great Goddess of Light, Yulin! Grant your dazzling light's
blessing upon Yuri, the sword of the Tautoki Kingdom!"  
  
And as she shouted, thrusting her sword skyward, immense magical power
burst forth from her entire body.  
Those watching expressed surprise, and the Royal Knights exchanged
glances, realizing their captain was serious.  
  
Even for a test of skill, this level of power deviated significantly
from what could be called mere sparring.  
Lilybell hesitated, wondering if she should intervene, but the
increasingly bewildered Bery and the casually eating Krische beside her
made her pause.  
  
"I see, people here are very clumsy with magic, aren't they?"  
"C-clumsy...?"  
"Most of her magic is dissipating. Perhaps because she has too much
internal magic, she just wastes it..."  
  
The light of magic that transformed a steel sword into a sword of
light.  
Yuri's level was 56—one of the continent's foremost warriors.  
She felt a sense of incongruity at Krische's blunt statement that she
was "clumsy."  
And despite the pressure that made everyone take a step back, Hero Bery
stood still, her sword dangling.  
  
"Now, it's your turn, Hero."  
"N-no... I don't really... do that kind of thing..."  
  
At those words, did Yuri feel insulted?  
A deep frown etched itself between her brows, and she replied,
"Understood."  
  
"...Princess, give the signal."  
"Oh, yes... then."  
  
Lilybell raised her right hand.  
  
"...Begin."  
  
The moment she swung her hand down, Yuri swung her sword, held in a
proper stance, upwards.  
Flash Blade Yuri—her epithet was not just for show.  
The single strike released from her magic-enhanced body was a blade of
light that could cleave any obstacle in front of her several ken away.  
It was an exquisite technique that could even cleave a dragon's neck at
close range.  
  
To counter it, one would have to wield a magic sword capable of
nullifying it, or gain the initiative with a stride that overwhelmed her
sword speed. However, the distance of three ken was too great.  
If a direct confrontation with a magic sword wasn't to be engaged, then,
as Yuri suggested, it should have been brought to a purely sword-skill
match at a closer range.  
  
However, Hero Bery neither released nor condensed magic, and even faced
her without drawing her sword.  
At this rate, she would simply stand there and take the magic sword's
blow.  
  
She's underestimating Yuri too much—  
  
"...Eh?"  
  
—The moment that thought occurred, it was over.  
  
The next moment she thought the standing figure had lowered her stance,
the tip of her sword had pierced the side of Yuri's neck.  
As if she had teleported.  
No, seeing her tied-up hair floating in the air and the hem of her apron
dress gently falling, it must have been a stride so fast it couldn't
even be recognized.  
  
This was confirmed by the cool breeze she felt.  
  
Everyone present held their breath.  
Even Yuri, who had swung her sword of light, froze in her stance.  
Only the troubled, apologetic Bery and the girl beside her, who was
eating cookies, seemed at ease.  
  
"Ehehe, you're really good, Bery. It was like a 'Pishun!'"  
"Ah, thank you... Um, I'm so sorry."  
  
As Bery apologized, Yuri, who had been frozen, finally managed to
stammer, "No," in a strained voice.  
Then, releasing the magic she had gathered, she knelt and bowed her
head.  
  
"To question your power... I spoke out of line, Hero."  
"N-no such thing... I, too, um, I'm sorry..."  
  
Hero Bery also bowed her head in a hurry.  
Her body movements, which gave no hint of the magic she was condensing
within her, and yet a stride that seemed to transcend time—that was the
transcendent height of level 327.  
The power of the incomprehensible unique ability, "Maid's Refinement
(Special Rank)."  
  
Perhaps the meaning of "just a hobby" was different between their
worlds.  
The day they would understand that answer never came. 
<br /><br />

  
***Chapter 2: The Princess from Another World*** 
<br /><br />

Their world seemed incomparably more advanced than this one.  
They could translate languages instantly, travel between their world and
this one with mysterious doors, and even spatial transfer, which mages
here laughed at as fantasy, was possible for the hero, they heard.  
While there seemed to be some difficulty due to the thin magic here,
they said that if they drew magic from their world, they could easily
reach the evil dragon's nest, the demonic mountain Chieu-Nhen.  
  
However, the concern was the mixing of the two worlds.  
Drawing too much magic from their world could potentially have a
significant negative impact on this world later on.  
If it were just the heroes, they could have reached the vicinity of the
evil dragon by traveling through their world, taking that into account,
but the problem was Lilybell and her companions.  
Out of consideration for them, who also wanted to check and respond to
the damage in villages and towns, they decided to continue their journey
by land.  
  
On their side, to prepare for a potential failure and to seal the evil
dragon, Lilybell and the Great Sage Yaquai were present.  
From the Royal Knights, they brought eight hand-picked elites, including
Yuri, Lilybell's most trusted warrior.  
Everyone was mounted, and they intended to prepare horses for the heroes
as well, but—  
  
"Ehehe, it's been a while since we've traveled with Gururun."  
"Indeed. We always go straight to the location..."  
  
From beyond the door, the girl named Krische had brought a green tiger
to ride.  
It was unimaginably huge, about nine shaku at the shoulder.  
Krische and Hero Bery, now in black travel cloaks over their apron
dresses, casually sat on the tiger's back, chatting as they proceeded
along the road.  
They said it was a pet they kept at their mansion, but it was not the
kind of creature one imagined when hearing the word "pet."  
  
The Royal Knights watching from behind were confused, as were Lilybell
and her companions.  
By all appearances, it was an incredibly vicious monster.  
In terms of fear, it wasn't much different from the dragons they were
about to hunt.  
  
In fact, upon inquiry, they learned it was simply classified as a beast
and called a magical beast.  
From what they heard, it was a creature treated similarly to the
monsters inhabiting this world; its fur was supple, but each strand was
like a metal fiber.  
Even a single shed hair could not be easily cut without striking it with
a blade.  
  
―――――――――――――――――――  
Gururun  
Class: Pet (Cat)  
Level: 132  
Unique Ability: King of the Forest (High Rank)  
―――――――――――――――――――  
  
Judging by its level and the unique ability *King of the Forest (High
Rank),* Gururun was likely a monster that Lilybell and her group
couldn't even scratch.  
Even when passing through areas that should have been teeming with
monsters, there was an unnatural absence.  
It was a monster that even other monsters instinctively fled from.  
During a forest encampment, when they witnessed it felling trees at
terrifying speed and hunting wild boars (apparently just playing),
Lilybell and her group understood instinctively.  
  
And so, the journey progressed smoothly for about three days.  
Each time they made camp, the two offered Lilybell's group magnificent
meals.  
While apologetic that they couldn't share much about the technology and
civilization of their world, they were actively engaged in everyday
exchanges, discussing minor cultural and customary differences.  
Discussions about food were always the easiest.  
Krische's eyes would sparkle when they spoke of local specialties and
regional dishes to the two, who seemed particularly interested in
ingredients and cooking.  
Every time she heard about unknown ingredients, she would talk excitedly
with Bery, and the atmosphere was amicable, but Lilybell was still
curious about her.  
  
―――――――――――――――――――  
Krische Alberina Christand  
Class: Maid Princess (Hunter)  
Level: ——  
Unique Ability: Gentle Hunter (Mythic Rank)  
―――――――――――――――――――  
  
At some point, her class and unique ability had changed.  
Visually, it was probably just a change of clothes.  
A high-quality black cloak, a one-piece dress or a shirt and skirt.  
However, her boots were sturdy, reinforced with iron, and she had two
short swords at her back.  
One was simply made, and the other had elegant carvings.  
Both appeared to be well-maintained but old, and the simple one seemed
very well-used.  
  
While her attire was that of a young lady traveling, it was a strange
outfit that was reminiscent of battle, but it felt strangely fitting.  
And the incomprehensible unique ability, *Gentle Hunter (Mythic
Rank)*.  
  
Class names and unique abilities were said to be determined by
self-perception, the perception of others, and objective factors from
one's history and abilities.  
Perhaps by changing out of her apron dress, her own perception of
herself changed, and a suitable new class and unique ability were
assigned.  
Such things sometimes happened with people who distinguished between
different roles, and there were even people in the underworld who,
through training and self-hypnosis, intentionally faked their classes.  
  
If it were just the class, she might be someone from such a
profession.  
Her conversational demeanor was innocent and childlike, yet there were
several incongruities.  
Her movements, just by jumping onto Gururun, her pet, were unnatural.  
Nine shaku at the shoulder—even higher than ten shaku depending on her
posture.  
Her movement of leaping onto that giant body and sitting sideways did
not seem like that of a level 0 individual at all.  
An ordinary person, unable to enhance their body, couldn't even reach
that height in the first place.  
  
Given that, why was her level 0?  
If it were 2 or 3, one could at least be minimally convinced that she
had high physical abilities but hadn't trained.  
However, her level was unlisted.  
  
An unusually humble maid hero (Level 327) who didn't seem intent on
fighting.  
An armed princess (Level Unlisted) who was oddly knowledgeable about
magic and combat techniques.  
Each time her thoughts led to ridiculous answers, she shook her head,
thinking, "Surely not."  
  
She had heard that the magic systems in their world and this one were
vastly different.  
Chant magic, level display, and so on—while fundamentally using the same
power, the very laws themselves were significantly different.  
The two said that the magic they used was much more primitive and
explained it as a stamp and a brush.  
A brush offered more freedom, but stamping made it easier to create the
same thing repeatedly.  
  
Lilybell and her group used the same magic by giving it direction
through chanting.  
The broad strokes were the same. The difference in effect was purely due
to the amount of magic imbued, but it seemed they were creating magic on
the fly each time.  
The two were leisurely wondering how to explain it, but the Great Sage
Yaquai, most knowledgeable about magic and its history, was
speechless.  
  
*"...I believe what the two of them are speaking of might be the
primordial magic of the Age of Gods,"* he whispered to Lilybell later.  
Long before any other form of magic was created, primordial magic was
said to grant all wishes.  
The words of God was incomprehensible to humans.  
Words of power that, if wielded freely, could even twist the laws of the
world.  
  
It was a mythical existence whose very existence was doubted, but seeing
Bery's extraordinary power, it didn't seem impossible.  
It was Krische who effortlessly opened and attempted to close the hole
that Lilybell and her group were desperately trying to pry open.  
  
The advent of the hero—was that truly what it was?  
A duo freely moving between worlds.  
Their power was already—  
  
"Oh, flying lizards, Bery."  
"Are those the dragons there...? They're flying."  
  
Startled by their words, she looked up at the sky.  
Far enough away to still be black dots, there were two shadows in the
sky.  
  
"—Goddess, bring me tidings!"  
  
The guards stirred, and immediately Great Sage Yaquai raised his staff
and chanted.  
Waves of magic propagated through the air and returned a little later.  
  
"Princess, two adult dragons... both are large ones."  
"Yes, all personnel, prepare for battle! ...Hero, is that alright?"  
"Um... yes, Krische-sama."  
"They seem to have noticed us."  
  
Krische jumped gracefully from Gururun and went towards the carriage.  
From inside, she grabbed two spears and lightly threw one forward.  
It was an incredibly smooth throw.  
Again, movements that seemed impossible for someone with level 0.  
  
The two shadows, which had appeared as black dots, approached at an
astonishing speed, and their shapes quickly became distinct.  
Krische skillfully twirled the spear, while Bery, who calmly watched
from atop Gururun, who was yawning, left Lilybell and her companions
confused.  
  
The distance between them was a little over one ri.  
  
"!"  
  
The two approaching dragons let out terrifying roars, shaking the very
air.  
Chanting softly, she confirmed both were in the 80s in level. They were
large dragons, even among their kind.  
  
"Ehehe, it's been a while since we've had flying lizard steak. Krische
hopes the meat is tender..."  
"Fufu, Krische-sama likes steak, doesn't she?"  
  
The two conversed leisurely, then Krische suddenly crouched down.  
There was no visible stride, but a terrifying roar echoed.  
As they watched Krische roll, confused, there was a snap and a dragon's
scream.  
  
A ri away in the sky, one dragon, its head gone, was falling.  
  
The other flapped its wings with a screech, and immediately there was
another boom.  
A black shadow streaked by in an instant, hitting the other dragon's
head, scattering it into a shower of blood and flesh.  
The colossal bodies that slammed into the ground a ri away caused two
tremors.  
  
"Nnn, maybe it was too much? It was quite tender, so what a waste—"  
  
A majestic fanfare echoed before the stunned Lilybell and her group.  
  
"Oh... something's ringing."  
  
Above Krische's head, a light signaled a level up.  
Feathered lights danced, and again, a fanfare.  
Countless feathered lights blessed Krische, who had leveled up three
times in an instant.  
  
Above the hero's head, too, was the same fanfare and feathered lights.  
"What is it?" the hero asked, mystified, and Lilybell informed her.  
  
"I-it's the Goddess's blessing, signifying that your level has reached a
new stage..."  
"Oh, I see... so that's how it works. Is that kind of magic cast on the
world itself...?"  
  
The hero's level became 328.  
Krische's level was still unlisted. 
<br /><br />

  
"It must be a mistake; the hero is probably Krische-sama."  
Such words were reiterated while dismembering the dragon—a creature
called a "flying lizard" in their world.  
After seeing the dragon's carcass, its head crushed by a simple thrown
spear from a ri away, there were no words left to refute the *ridiculous
delusion*.  
Her level was simply too high to be displayed.  
That must have been it.  
  
*Gentle Hunter (Mythic Rank)* literally meant a gentle hunter.  
It depicted her taking the creature's life instantly without inflicting
pain—the dragon's skull burst, and it surely had no time to feel
anything.  
If told she was a gentle hunter, it was a scene that forced one to
grudgingly agree.  
  
Apparently, it was a prey animal sometimes eaten in their world, and she
was skilled at dismemberment.  
Saying, "It's easy when these flying lizards don't have scales," she
quickly skinned it until it was just meat.  
Under her instruction, the guards' swords were treated as butcher
knives.  
The leftover meat was transported to a warehouse beyond the door for
preservation, and their journey continued.  
  
The next day, in a village they visited, they were asked to deal with
the monsters disturbing the mountain. They encountered a monstrous boar,
which could be called the mountain's master, but—  
  
"Ah, it's around here, alright."  
  
She effortlessly pierced its tough hide, which could be called armor,
and in a flash, thrust her spear into its heart.  
Even an opponent that would require an army became prey to be hunted.  
Perhaps as a result of the dragons expanding their habitat, villages and
towns everywhere were suffering from monster attacks, but all were
swiftly pierced by spears, or had their necks slit by short swords, or
sometimes had their heads crushed by javelins. All of which became that
day's dinner.  
The accompanying guards no longer even drew their swords.  
  
Without letting the monsters, possessing the keen senses characteristic
of wild beasts, detect her, Krische easily hunted them.  
Gururun, their pet from the mansion, playfully punched the head of a
monster that would make anyone brace themselves, and snapped its neck
fashionably.  
Bery, the maid, who left Captain Yuri utterly helpless, watched such
scenes with a smile and clapped.  
  
This was what it meant for worlds to be different.  
The monsters feared in this world were probably like rabbits or
something to them.  
  
The way levels increased was also from another world.  
Every time a new monster was hunted or dismembered, Krische's level rose
many times, and fanfares resounded.  
Fanfares also played above Gururun's head as he played.  
And for Bery, who was just watching with a smile, fanfares occasionally
played for some reason.  
Did the goddess's fanfares also have sale periods?  
It was an extraordinary display of generosity.  
  
Level signifies strength.  
As experience accumulates, and magical power and skill increase, one's
rank rises one by one.  
Some take ten or twenty years to go from level 10 to 11, while others
reach 40 or 50 in the same amount of time.  
Innately born talent was a cruel thing.  
Even doing the same thing, the experience gained would be vastly
different.  
Even swinging a sword for the same amount of time, or defeating the same
monster, the rewards were not equal.  
  
The only certain thing was that the higher one became, the more immense
the experience required.  
To raise one's level after decades of training and reaching a certain
level required tremendous effort.  
To some extent, feasts were held to celebrate a level increase.  
  
Levels were something to be built up.  
It was inevitable that the higher one built them, the harder it would
become to gain new experience.  
What exactly were they gaining experience from?  
Lilybell and her group could only remain silent each time a fanfare rang
out.  
  
A dragon that reappeared was cleanly struck in the heart with a single
blow. From a ri away.  
Apparently, it was intentional, and the spear, which had previously
broken the dragon's head, remained cleanly stuck.  
The fact that she had also considered the dragon's posture as it fell
from the sky was understood from the two's satisfied expressions as they
looked at the spear's condition, saying things like:  
  
*"Nn, if we take them down like this, we can reuse the spear."*  
*"Fufu, as expected of Krische-sama, you're very skilled."*  
*"Ehehe, they have a habit of raising their upper body when they roar,
so Bery can do it too if she times it right. They'll fall on their
backs, too."*  
  
When dismembering prey, both the maid and the princess gained levels.  
Perhaps they gained immense experience from understanding the monster's
body structure, where to thrust the spear to kill it, and where its most
vulnerable points were.  
Yuri, who had a solemn expression, seemed to interpret it that way.  
  
When Yuri humbly requested that they teach her swordsmanship, if it
wouldn't be too much trouble, the two explained that their fundamental
fighting styles and ways of using power were different. Even the
distance in which they faced each other, which was five or six ken.  
They said it was adistance chosen where even a spear wouldn't graze
them, and unlike Yuri's world which emphasized power, their world
emphasized speed.  
  
An astonishing stride and a single flash were produced by maximizing the
use of all five senses, combined with precise and fluid, divine-like
magical manipulation.  
Their blade range was vastly different; even at seemingly abnormal long
distances, there was little difference from having a sword swung right
before one's eyes.  
An abnormal stride that could be completed within a single motion of
swinging the sword.  
According to Krische, being able to do that was the bare minimum.  
  
Of course, that was from Krische's perspective, who was at a much higher
level.  
Bery said that in reality, not many people in their world could combine
a four or five ken stride with a single sword swing, but there was no
doubt that their world's swordsmanship overwhelmed theirs in terms of
speed.  
Their world's combat techniques had always been refined with human
opponents in mind, she said.  
In contrast, Bery explained that their world's combat techniques
emphasized power to defeat monsters.  
  
There were many monsters living here that threatened people, and many of
them had strong skins or shells, so all soldiers trained to fight
monsters.  
In contrast, in their world, magical beasts were rare, and seldom
appeared on roads.  
Except for a very few regions, they were so rare that there was no
specialized training for magical beast subjugation.  
If it was due to differences in purpose, then one could agree.  
  
And the difference in magical power.  
The magical power of people here seemed much greater compared to theirs,
and in their world, magic used surrounding magical power.  
It was extremely difficult to use magic solely with internal magical
power.  
If one could use a magic sword to cleave several ken away, it was no
different from them bringing several ken into their blade range with a
stride.  
Bery said it might be better to refine that, but when earnestly
requested by Yuri and others, she looked troubled and instructed them.  
  
Yuri and the hand-picked Royal Knights were treated like children.  
What kind of humility was the phrase "just a hobby," after all?  
The ultimate ideal, understood in a single swing.  
What the master and servant demonstrated was the ultimate sword.  
  
Pushing one's strengths against the opponent's weaknesses.  
Restricting or killing the opponent's movements with feints and
invitations to prevent strong actions, and inducing weak actions.  
Ultimately, it was a stacking block puzzle, words that surely came from
mastery.  
  
Once one reached their peak, all there was to think about was how to
deal with the opponent, and the resounding fanfares signified that.  
Meeting new monsters, learning their habits and structures, and knowing
their weaknesses directly translated into strength.  
A hero was someone who gained levels by solving a stacking block
puzzle.  
The two were already in a realm where they no longer needed to swing a
sword, a state that could be understood but not truly grasped.  
  
*"Yes... it's true that Krische is slightly, just a tiny bit, better at
some things, but Bery is much, much more amazing and clever and smart
than Krische, so if 'Hero' refers to the strongest person in the world,
it's still Bery. Krische is still nowhere near Bery's level."*  
*"K-Krische-sama... you'll only make them misunderstand even more..."*  
  
Seeing Krische, who was apparently the world's best swordswoman in their
world, speak so freely, it was clear that the hero also deviated from
the realm of ordinary people.  
Perhaps she realized that humility was rude after the spar with Yuri, as
she no longer said things like "just a hobby," but—  
  
*"Krische just plays with swords a few times a year when there's free
time. Bery is always super busy with her duties as a servant."*  
  
Listening to Krische's words, it was clear that it was indeed "just a
hobby".  
—Though it was an extraordinary one.  
  
Because of what Krische said, the hero ultimately remained Bery.  
In essence, for Lilybell and her group, it didn't change the fact that
they were an unimaginably transcendent master-servant pair, a story of
incomprehensible heights.  
Bery seemed uncomfortable being called "Hero," but she reluctantly
accepted it, and the journey continued smoothly thereafter.  
  
Many things happened, such as Yuri's level rising for the first time in
three years after seeing the essence of swordsmanship from the two, but
the journey to subjugate the evil dragon proceeded incredibly
peacefully. About two weeks had passed.  
  
"How dare a mere servant monopolize Onee-sama for two whole weeks!"  
"...Krische thought she told Kreschenta, who only ever acts spoiled, to
stay behind."  
"Now, now, Krische-sama..."  
  
The one who appeared was the mistress of what was called the mansion.  
Her graceful golden hair shimmered red, and her large eyes narrowed.  
  
―――――――――――――――――――  
Kreschenta Farna Vera Alberan  
Class: Pet (Princess)  
Level: ——  
Unique Ability: The Dog Who Was a Great and Wise Ruler (Mythic Rank)  
―――――――――――――――――――  
  
Another princess with an unlisted level.  
  
"The Dog Who Was a Great and Wise Ruler"—what kind of extraordinary
power did she possess?  
And what did "Pet" mean?  
Lilybell and her group exchanged glances at the sight of the new hero
party. 
<br /><br />

  
In a world where blue light covered the sky.  
In the mansion's garden, surrounded by trees, a girl with elegantly tied
golden hair wore a blouse and skirt, drinking tea.  
  
"It's nice to have a quiet, relaxing cup of tea once in a while."  
"Fufu, it's a bit lonely when even Kreschenta-sama goes out."  
  
The black-haired servant smiled wryly, taking a sip of tea herself.  
With an exasperated look, the golden-haired girl—Selene—said,  
  
"You really are strange, aren't you? You seem to genuinely enjoy dealing
with that sullen idiot who's been left behind, day after day, never
getting bored..."  
"It was a great task entrusted to me by Krische-sama... So it was a lot
of fun."  
  
The black-haired servant—Anne—spoke with a smile, and Selene's
exasperation deepened.  
  
Another world and this world had apparently connected, and Krische and
Bery were asked to defeat something like a flying lizard.  
It was the custom of that country to summon a hero from another world in
times of global crisis, and they couldn't refuse, so they went out,
saying it was just for magical beast subjugation.  
It was a completely separate world with no connection to theirs, and
they didn't understand much about it, but if Bery said it was okay, then
it probably was.  
  
She was generally a good-for-nothing servant, but she did possess a
proper sense of decency.  
Selene had suspected for a long time that Bery had learned decency just
to trample on it, but it was Bery who had taught Selene about law,
ethics, and morality.  
How many times had she wished she could make the current Bery hear her
own words from back then?  
  
The problem was Kreschenta.  
From her sister, who was in the mood for travel:  
  
*"This trip—no, this journey is for Bery to relax...* ahem*, it's a very
important task that Bery, the hero, was asked to do. Krische will go
along to help, but Kreschenta has to be good and stay at the mansion,
alright?"*  
  
Despite being repeatedly reminded of this and reluctantly agreeing,
Kreschenta was in a foul mood.  
Every day, she grumbled, constantly intruded on Selene, and pestered
Anne, who was serving as her babysitter, with constant demands. Yet,
Anne herself was cheerful and smiling all day long.  
Selene wouldn't want to deal with a sulking Kreschenta even if asked,
but Anne cared for her whole-heartedly, saying "Leave it to me" no
matter what was said.  
It was as if it were her life's purpose.  
  
Kreschenta was foolish, selfish, and messy, and basically more helpless
than Krische, but surprisingly, she sometimes showed consideration for
others.  
When faced with Anne, who was entirely composed of goodwill, she seemed
to regain the consideration she had long forgotten, and Anne's abilities
were what allowed her to endure for two weeks.  
Apparently, she couldn't be too strong-willed with Anne, who doted on
her and appeased her every time she grumbled, saying things like "I'm
here for you."  
  
"To me, Kreschenta-sama is still, and always will be, a great Queen. I
would be happy to care for her every day if allowed."  
"You're the only one who says such things to that child. You're as bad
as Bery. Though Bery treated Kreschenta like a child from the very
beginning."  
  
Anne chuckled, seemingly enjoying herself.  
  
"Everyone back then truly bore immense responsibilities. Perhaps
Selene-sama, who was at the heart of it, doesn't understand..."  
"…?"  
"It was precisely because of everyone's immense struggles in that era
that so many people were truly saved and lived happily, I believe."  
  
She placed her hand on her chest, looking blissful.  
  
"If there is any purpose for me, one of the many people of that time, it
is to express my gratitude and serve all of you who lived through that
era."  
  
It was a smile that didn't change even after many years, a smile that
revealed her pure heart.  
  
"The great Queen and Alberinea, and the noble Grand Marshal of the
Kingdom, are now forgotten and remain only in historical records. But I
alone, as one of the people who lived then, wish to eternally remember
all that you accomplished."  
  
Selene blushed and sighed at Anne's declaration.  
This was why Kreschenta couldn't deal with it.  
  
Every single day, she was lazy and indulged in selfishness.  
She would sulk, cling affectionately, and act like a three-year-old
playing "woof-woof."  
Despite her current state, to be treated with such genuine respect must
have been incredibly uncomfortable.  
  
"...You're quite the opposite of Bery in many ways, aren't you?"  
"O-opposite..."  
"Well, that's fine. You're just like that. Perhaps because I usually
interact with Bery, my heart feels cleansed when I'm with you, truly.
Next time, let me have a bit of your wisdom."  
"Oh, that's far too much to ask..."  
  
Anne said, looking troubled, and Selene sighed.  
Despite writing questionable books, what a pure heart she possessed.  
Completely unlike a certain other servant.  
  
"Well, let's relax for a while. Since Bery has taken those two idiots on
a trip, we might as well enjoy this time... How about we gather around a
bonfire and have a barbecue in the garden tonight while looking at the
night sky? Let's call Lira too."  
"Oh, that sounds fun."  
"Elvena-sama, are you done with your work?"  
  
The servant with black hair cut evenly at the shoulders—Elvena—nodded
and smiled.  
  
"Lira-sama is also nearing the end of her training cycle, so I'll call
her later."  
"...Don't tease her too much, okay?"  
"Tease...?"  
"Don't play innocent. Honestly..."  
  
Selene said exasperatedly, then laughed.  
  
"Well, they're having fun over there. We might as well have a drink and
have fun too." 
<br /><br />

  
***Chapter 3: The Light of Aena*** 
<br /><br />

The noble, solitary ruler who governed the other world.  
The King of Kings, a supreme monarch equal to a god, Kreschenta Farna
Vera Alberan (self-proclaimed).  
  
The beautiful girl, like Krische, had an unlisted level.  
She was an existence of such a high level that her level wasn't even
displayed.  
Was she an existence similar to, or even greater than, the hero and
Krische?  
Lilybell and her group were confused as to why she had appeared, but—  
  
"So noisy... *yawn*..."  
"Fufu, congratulations on leveling up."  
  
In conclusion, there was simply one more resounding fanfare added to the
mix.  
A fanfare played above Kreschenta, who was being held by the hero,
letting out a sleepy yawn.  
A fanfare played above the hero.  
Naturally, fanfares also played in multitudes above Krische.  
  
On the mountain path, lying on the ground was the Mineral Dragon
Heigane.  
It was a colossal dragon, its hide literally covered in ore-like
scales.  
Although it couldn't fly, its charge was said to be able to collapse
even castle walls, making it a high-ranking monster among dragons—but
the moment it let out a warning roar, its brain was effortlessly
destroyed by a spear piercing its mouth. An instant kill.  
  
"Uuu...!"  
"No 'uuu,' you promised to do your work properly. If you don't help with
the dismemberment, you'll be forced back home."  
  
With that, Krische pinched Kreschenta's cheek, and the dismemberment
began.  
The Royal Knights also approached immediately and participated in the
work, following their instructions.  
It was a dragon dismemberment task that might happen once in a lifetime,
but the Royal Knights were already accustomed to it.  
Their swords became butchering knives, and they did their work smoothly
as if dismembering cattle or pigs.  
As dragons and large monsters were hunted down with such ease, their
surprise dwindled. When an enemy appeared, they drew their swords not
for battle, but for dismemberment.  
  
"Ehehe, this time the dragon's horn goes to you, doesn't it?"  
"Y-yes, my deepest gratitude...!"  
  
Dragon horns, which were rare and valuable, should have been kept family
heirlooms, but they seemed uninterested and gifted them every time a
dragon was hunted.  
Apparently, they had an abundance of them in their world.  
  
"Puririn, please peel the skin."  
  
A slime named Puririn, picked up by Krische about three days ago and
joining the hero's party, slipped its body between the dragon's flesh
and hide, peeling off the skin as if it were shedding.  
When they first met, it was level 3.  
The trembling slime, which had been looking at them, had grown
tremendously by devouring dragon flesh and blood, reaching the major
milestone of level 30 in just three days.  
As they watched the mineral dragon being forcibly shed with grating and
cracking sounds, they felt various common senses fade into the distant
past.  
  
"...This journey has brought many gains, Princess."  
  
Yuri approached Lilybell, who was sitting on a rock beside her.  
  
"Yes, your level also reached 60 after three years..."  
"I had only focused on increasing the power of my sword for thirty
years... Meeting the heroes, I feel a new path has opened."  
  
Yuri nodded, saying so.  
Combat was a clash of power, with direct confrontation as the basic
principle.  
The kingdom's swordsmanship aimed for victory by unleashing a maximally
enhanced strike against a formidable enemy.  
  
A warrior's blade, wielded only by eliminating fear, expelling evil
thoughts, and pushing oneself to the limit.  
Though there were minor differences, this was the basic principle of
combat in this world.  
Responding to maximum power with maximum power was considered a virtue
even in duels and spars.  
As Bery said, it was probably because they had emphasized fighting
monsters.  
  
In contrast, their fighting style aimed to completely neutralize the
opponent's power and achieve victory with minimal force, seemingly
employing tactics that would be considered cowardly in their culture.  
  
*"The teaching of the Christand family is that any means can be used to
win a fight... Strength is freedom, isn't it, Bery?"*  
*"Y-yes, that's right."*  
  
—Strength is freedom.  
Not pride or honor, but why one wields a sword.  
Why must one win?  
  
Such words seemed to strike a chord with Yuri and became a catalyst.  
Her level, which had been stagnant for three years, rose by three, now
reaching 60.  
Several of the Royal Knights also leveled up during their training.  
  
"I felt a limit to my magic sword. Focusing solely on it with resolve to
unleash maximum power... While there are certainly advantages there,
such a blade can only defeat those weaker than me."  
  
Yuri touched the sword at her hip and nodded.  
  
"How to win without wielding power. The skills of the Hero and
Krische-sama are always sufficient, the absolute minimum... a strike
neither excessive nor insufficient. If mastered, they can easily crush a
dragon's skull with a spear that doesn't even conduct magic, and even
fell a mineral dragon. That must be the path to aim for from now on."  
  
Hearing those words, Lilybell smiled.  
  
"I am simply amazed by the power of the heroes. To be shown such
immense, insurmountable power and still not lose your enthusiasm... I'm
glad to have a warrior like you by my side."  
"What have I been doing all this time...? Honestly, I felt disheartened,
but I am the princess's sword. Even if it breaks, I can melt it down and
reforge it... I was able to think that way again."  
"...Yuri."  
  
Yuri knelt and took Lilybell's hand.  
  
"Though still dull, I will surely become a sword worthy of the
princess."  
"Yes. I expect nothing less."  
  
And with that, a reverent kiss.  
At the ticklish sensation, Lilybell giggled, looked into her eyes,
and—  
  
"Well, well, youth is a wonderful thing, isn't it?"  
  
Hearing him, the two startled and blushed.  
The approaching figure was the long-bearded old man, the Great Sage
Yaquai.  
  
"...Yaquai, do not interfere with the blossoms' embrace... Yulin's
judgment will fall upon you."  
"Ah, my apologies... I thought their embrace had concluded."  
"Honestly, for the Great Sage of Yulin to act like that, what will
people think?"  
  
Lilybell blushed and glared at the old man.  
In the Tautoki Kingdom, where the goddess was worshipped, women held
power, and their intimacy was revered as sacred.  
Divine punishment was said to befall those who interfered with it.  
Yuri, also blushing, cleared her throat pointedly and said,  
  
"Princess... the Great Sage is well-versed in the goddess's teachings.
He must have something on his mind."  
"...On his mind?"  
  
Yaquai nodded, gazing at the path ahead.  
  
"As one who vowed to be a watcher... I have no desire to do something as
sinful as intruding on the relationship between flowers. However, I can
sense it."  
"Sense it...?"  
"Yes. When light shines brightly... shadows also deepen into darkness.
As you know, there are two great powers in this world: light and
darkness."  
  
Lilybell and Yuri frowned and nodded.  
It was a fundamental principle of this world, taught from childhood.  
  
"However, Yulin and Galra, the two sister goddesses who govern them,
sometimes disagree but are in a loving relationship... therefore, even
though the world contains opposing elements, it is maintained. You know
that too, don't you?"  
"...Yes, what about it?"  
"It means this. Not just light and darkness... there is another great
power that connects them in this world."  
"!"  
  
"This is just a theory, but," Yaquai continued, gazing at the heroes.  
The two princesses clinging to the hero's arms, indulging her.  
  
"When the hero appeared with Krische-sama, I had a faint feeling, but
after another one... Kreschenta-sama appeared, it became almost certain.
How do the heroes appear to you, Princess?"  
"They are... very, very close, I'd say."  
  
Lilybell exchanged glances with Yuri and replied.  
From morning till night, literally all day long, the two were
inseparable.  
In the early morning, they would emerge from the tent together, happily
nibbling on leftover dinner from the night before, and joyfully prepare
breakfast.  
They would talk about what to make with ingredients obtained from towns
and villages, expertly finishing dishes at astonishing speed, all while
being affectionate.  
  
It was precisely what was meant by "do not intrude on the flowers."  
The two existed within an aura that could only be called a "flower
barrier," impenetrable to others.  
They could only be spoken to during their spare moments (which were very
few) or while traveling on Gururun's back, when Krische was peacefully
resting against Bery, asleep.  
  
At night, Krische, after having some alcohol, would become even more
affectionate, and she would head into the tent with Bery, who blushed in
embarrassment.  
Apparently, when drunk, she became a "kiss monster," and their closeness
was so endearing that it made the observers blush.  
With Kreschenta now added to the mix, the flower barrier had grown even
stronger.  
  
"From my perspective, the heroes are both Yulin and Galra."  
"...That is."  
"Light encompasses darkness, and darkness encompasses light. We are
apostles of the Goddess of Light, Yulin... but the heroes likely make no
such distinctions. They make Yulin's flowers bloom in the daytime sun,
and Galra's flowers in the moonlight."  
  
"What a beautiful way to be," Yaquai nodded deeply.  
The Goddess of Light, Yulin, reveres pure love, and the Goddess of
Darkness, Galra, reveres desired love.  
Therefore, Yulin's followers consider eye contact and touching hands
with modesty as the supreme form, while Galra's followers consider a
deep, possessive relationship as supreme.  
Some say that one is all, but those who have deepened their
understanding are more tolerant, believing that each is highlighted
precisely because it encompasses light and darkness.  
  
"The embodiment of the goddesses' miracle, harmonizing light and
darkness. The heroes are truly such beings... I saw the power of
beautiful flowers in them."  
"The power of flowers..."  
"Yulin and Galra, and the power of the Aena flower, the kingdom's crest,
which connects them. This world is formed by that."  
  
Lilybell widened her eyes, and Yaquai continued.  
  
"However, just as with light and darkness... the power of Aena also has
its opposite."  
"...The Evil Dragon Ojiros."  
"Yes. A power that brings war and disaster to this world, as if
trampling beautiful flower fields. Perhaps the monsters too are strongly
influenced by it."  
  
Lilybell made a grimace, and Yuri was similar.  
  
"Don't you find it unnatural? Only extremely powerful monsters appear
before us. We manage only because of the heroes' power, but..."  
"Yes... I felt it. All of them are monsters that could easily destroy a
village or town if just one appeared."  
  
Krische effortlessly defeats them with a "shupan!" or a "bishu!", but
all of them were terrifying monsters.  
Against flying dragons, they could only hope to restrain them with magic
or pray that they were aiming for a skilled magic sword user.  
Armored monsters were beyond the capabilities of ordinary soldiers, and
even merely being large meant that many attacks would be ineffective.  
  
Monsters that couldn't be dealt with unless elites were brought in.  
It was surprising to find such powerful monsters inhabiting this
vicinity.  
  
"Just as light and darkness elevate each other, perhaps the strong
flower power of the heroes is also eliciting a response. It feels as if
the evil vibrations—Senky—emanating from that abominable mountain,
Chieu-Nhen, are strengthening as the heroes shine brighter."  
"Senky..."  
"An evil force that is said to rain blood and sorrow upon the world... a
catastrophic flame that will burn Yulin, Galra, and Aena to ashes. The
more brilliantly the heroes make their flowers bloom, the more that
flame will scorch the heavens. We must never be complacent."  
  
The moment she was about to respond to Yaquai, who spoke with a serious
expression,  
  
"!"  
  
—The air trembled.  
A roar that gripped her heart, making her legs weak.  
It echoed from the demonic mountain, its head peeking over the mountain
range.  
Lilybell instinctively gripped Yuri's hand, and Yuri squeezed back
tightly.  
  
The Royal Knights also stopped their work, looking towards the mountain,
backing away slightly.  
  
"They seem lively. The higher the level, the tastier they seem... The
evil dragon might be really delicious."  
"Fufu, yes. I hope the meat is tender..."  
"If it's tough, we could slice it thin and have yakiniku together,
grilling it to celebrate. Maybe make some light oxtail soup too..."  
"I want some cutlets too."  
  
The heroes were nonchalant. Gururun let out a big yawn.  
Did they feel nothing from this roar?  
They were only thinking about how to eat it.  
  
"Should I tell them...?" Lilybell asked.  
Yaquai shook his head solemnly at Lilybell's words.  
  
"The power of Aena, heightened by the addition of Kreschenta-sama... and
the corresponding strengthening of Senky's vibrations. I cannot tell
what result it would bring to dampen the heroes' spirits now, or to
diminish Aena's power."  
"...I see."  
"Besides, from what I've heard so far... perhaps the heroes came from a
world deeply steeped in Senky."  
  
Frowning, Yaquai looked at Yuri.  
  
"Skills refined in a world where people fight each other... terrifying
combat techniques devised on the premise of mutual killing among humans.
...Yuri, do you believe you can reach that height?"  
"No... I can approach it, but not reach it."  
  
Yaquai nodded deeply at her words.  
  
"I believe that extraordinary power, which surpasses our common sense,
was cultivated precisely because it was a world covered in Senky."  
"A world covered in Senky..."  
"Yet, despite such strength, the Aena flower blooms in full glory. I
also thought that the heroes might have been a single flower, coloring
and illuminating a desolate world of Senky."  
  
He gazed intently at Lilybell and Yuri.  
Then, he looked at the three happily cutting up dragon meat.  
  
"The light of Aena, enough to illuminate the world. Ojiros cannot defeat
a power equal to the goddess. Even if not, if Aena and Senky are in
opposition... the power of Senky that the heroes harbor within them will
determine the outcome."  
  
Yaquai added that his own wishes were mixed in, and Lilybell exchanged
glances with Yuri and smiled.  
  
"Let us have faith. They are heroes who appeared by the guidance of the
goddess. No matter how powerful the evil dragon Ojiros is, the heroes
will defeat it..."  
"Yes. The hero has rewritten our common sense countless times during
this short journey. It will be the same this time. ...Perhaps even the
evil dragon Ojiros will be finished with a single spear throw."  
  
Yaquai narrowed his thin eyes further and nodded gently at their
words.  
  
"Indeed. ...Faith is also a teaching of the Goddess Yulin." 
<br /><br />

  
"..."  
"..."  
"..."  
  
Another week passed—at dusk, on the summit of the demonic mountain,
Chieu-Nhen.  
At a makeshift cooking area set up with charcoal grills and stockpots,
the three watched Krische, who was unusually serious.  
She was meticulously layering thinly sliced meat on a cutting board, to
a pathological degree.  
  
Her movements, at first glance, seemed fluid and brilliantly effortless,
but a discerning eye could see the hesitation.  
Just as a meticulously crafted mechanism performs the same movements
without error, she, who had always drawn the theoretical peak, layered
red and fatty meat, constantly shifting its orientation, never quite
satisfied, and a faint sheen of sweat adorned her forehead.  
  
"Krische-sama, it's fine to just eyeball it, okay? Cooking should be fun
and relaxed."  
"Yes... but this is the last dish, a memory of this journey."  
  
Krische replied to the hero, who was tasting soup beside her with a wry
smile, and continued her work.  
Occasionally, a thin layer of salt was sprinkled between the meat, like
falling snowflakes in the deep night, to subtly enhance the aroma of
herbs.  
It was regular yet irregular, delicate yet bold.  
Like painting a picture, she created nuances of flavor.  
  
*"Then, as a memento of the journey's end... may I ask Krische-sama for
the main course, a cutlet?"*  
  
The moment the hero casually spoke those words, a deep frown appeared
between the girl's usually cheerful eyebrows.  
Her expression became as serious as if she were about to embark on a
life-or-death battle.  
  
*"...Understood. Krische will finish it as the finest dish, worthy of
adorning Bery's journey."*  
  
She spoke with gravity.  
First, she meticulously tasted thinly sliced meat from various parts,
searing each piece, and chose the base of the tail—the most flavorful
part of the dragon.  
She then combined it with fatty belly meat, considering the harmony of
richness, tenderness, and the sweetness of the oil.  
Calculated nuances of flavor.  
Her goal was a profound taste that changed with every tiny bite Bery
took.  
  
"...Onee-sama, is this breading alright?"  
  
Perhaps influenced by her sister's serious demeanor beside her,
Kreschenta, showing a hint of nervousness, presented a silver tray.  
She gazed at the freshly made breadcrumbs—a faint hint of aromatic herbs
mixed in—from toasted bread, then brought her face closer and closed her
eyes.  
  
*Gulp*, Kreschenta swallowed, looking at her silent sister.  
  
"...A perfect aroma, neither too much nor too little, and exquisite
shape and texture of the breadcrumbs. As expected of Krische's little
sister."  
  
Kreschenta smiled in relief at those words, and snuggled closer, saying,
"Praise me a lot later."  
  
"...Kreschenta, I'll leave the plating to you."  
"Understood."  
  
The seriousness was such that it made the observers tense.  
Everyone exchanged glances, speechless, and then looked at the pile of
meat placed nearby.  
  
It was a mountain of meat that used to be the evil dragon Ojiros,
butchered incomparably more crudely than the dish being prepared now. 
<br /><br />

  
It was past noon.  
The party, having reached the evil dragon's hollow at the summit, saw
the tragic sight of the sealed sword blessed by the
goddess—Lilyena—broken cleanly in two.  
And in the center of the hollow, the evil dragon, Ojiros, lay
prostrate.  
  
It was more than twice the size of an average dragon, surpassing the
tales told.  
It was clad in black scales with an obsidian-like sheen, and twisted
horns like lightning.  
Even folded, its wings were enormous enough to stir up a storm, and the
tip of its tail, which could easily topple houses, bore countless
vicious protrusions.  
  
Around it, large monster bones were scattered, mixed with many dragon
bones, presumably its kin.  
Even now, Ojiros lay prostrate, tearing and devouring the belly of a
dragon, its kin.  
  
"This is..."  
"...The Evil Dragon, Ojiros."  
  
Half a ri away, it showed no signs of panic even after noticing them.  
It devoured its dragon kin, glancing at Lilybell and her group, with the
dignified air of a king.  
It was the absolute ruler of dragons.  
  
It swallowed the dragon meat it had been devouring and annoyingly
flicked its tail.  
A high-pitched, flute-like sound echoed, and in response, the screams of
dragons resonated from all around.  
  
The "Whistle of Calamity," described in legends.  
A death knell that, when sounded, would send countless dragons soaring
through the sky, signaling the end of the world.  
  
"...Show me this being's power."  
  
As Lilybell chanted, its status appeared.  
  
―――――――――――――――――――  
Ojiros  
Class: Evil Dragon  
Level: 255  
Unique Ability: Ruler of Dragons (Special Rank)  
―――――――――――――――――――  
  
She shivered at the sight of the text, instinctively flinching.  
Level 255—like the hero, a distant height.  
Of course, the hero and Krische were overwhelmingly superior in terms of
level.  
However, Bery and the others had said that their unusually high levels
were merely an evaluation that included their use of magic.  
  
All three were unimaginably skilled magic users, freely traversing the
barrier between worlds.  
The hero had said that it seemed their levels, exceeding 300, were
evaluated as such precisely because they used that power, and it made it
easier to understand the two princesses whose levels were not
displayed.  
In particular, the difficulty of their magic seemed to increase
exponentially beyond a certain point.  
  
A state that could only be reached by accumulating an enormous number of
perfectly precise formulas.  
If the two had 100% precision, the hero's precision might be, for
example, 99%.  
Even if they could handle "simple magic" without inferiority, as it
became more complex and layered, those slight errors would accumulate,
eventually becoming fatal.  
The hero's abilities had limits, but the two's magic, theoretically,
could be wielded infinitely with infinite magic, and thus their levels
were not displayed.  
That was the heroes' interpretation.  
  
The heroes were still strong.  
They possessed overwhelming speed, power, and skill, but those were
likely strengths based on maximizing the use of their bodies and
adhering to physical laws.  
It remained questionable whether one could reach level 255 with that
alone.  
  
That colossal body, that oppressive aura.  
It didn't look like something a human body could contend with.  
  
Atop the formidable magical beast called Gururun.  
Krische, with a slime on her head, calmly observed Ojiros with a casual
"Whoa."  
And beside her—the hero, holding Kreschenta who was sleeping soundly and
pleasantly, looked slightly surprised, then opened her mouth when she
noticed Lilybell's gaze.  
  
"That's the evil dragon, huh... It's quite large."  
"Yes. ...Hero, its power is leagues beyond the dragons we've encountered
so far. ...If you need to, please use your magic."  
  
Drawing magic from another world could potentially have serious
consequences for this world—they had worried about this and had chosen
not to.  
But in this situation, such carelessness could be fatal.  
Unless they were prepared to face the risk, this evil dragon would bring
about a catastrophe that could destroy the world.  
  
"Magic...?"  
"Yes. Level 255... I heard that past records indicated around 150. The
current Ojiros possesses power beyond compare to when it was sealed in
the past—"  
"Bery, I'm going to hunt it now."  
  
Krische jumped down with a quick "Pyon!" and then scurried away.  
She left the stunned Lilybell and her group behind and ran.  
The slime on her head—Puririn—extended a tentacle and handed Krische a
spear. In response, Krische tossed Puririn high into the air.  
  
Had she not heard her?  
Lilybell was about to call out in a hurry but gasped at Ojiros's
presence as it reared its neck.  
It was in full combat stance, having completely perceived them as
enemies.  
It opened its maw wide, letting out a roar.  
The voice of the evil dragon, a calamity that shook heaven and earth,
made her insides tighten—but it stopped immediately.  
  
In front of Krische, who spun and rolled.  
With a sound that didn't sound like a spear, a single strike pierced
through Ojiros's gaping mouth, causing its internal organs to gush out
from the back of its head.  
Puririn, who had been tossed into the air, landed in Krische's hand as
she stood up.  
  
"Puririn, it's time to bleed it out. Can you do it?"  
  
At those words, Puririn wriggled its body as if to say, "Leave it to
me."  
  
The flapping of wings of the dragons gathered by the sound of
destruction. As soon as they witnessed that scene, they screamed and
vanished into the distance.  
Lilybell remained frozen, her arm still extended as if to reach out to
warn her. 
<br /><br />

  
A few hours later.  
Lilybell was eating what used to be the evil dragon—Ojiros, the calamity
that would destroy the world.  
  
For the feast, the table was laden with cutlets, soup, and bread.  
A large amount of meat for yakiniku was also prepared for those who
wanted more. The Royal Knights, who loved cooking, took the place of the
Hero Party and made the sizzling sounds of grilling meat.  
  
"It's really delicious, Krische-sama. This might be the best cutlet I've
ever had. Right, Kreschenta-sama?"  
"Of course! It's a dish Onee-sama and I made with all our heart."  
"Ehehe... but Krische is still nowhere near Bery, not at all..."  
  
Krische, with Kreschenta on her lap, who was puffing out her chest, put
her hands on her blushing cheeks and wiggled her body shyly.  
Behind them, Gururun and Puririn were devouring and melting Ojiros's
heart (which was apparently too tough to eat), looking utterly
satisfied.  
  
"I-it's delicious, Princess..."  
"Y-yes... Yuri."  
  
The cutlet, pulled from the oil so brilliantly that it seemed to glow,
as if not tolerating even the slightest imperfection, was a golden
brown.  
Two types of sauce, each with a different flavor, drew elegant flowers
on the wooden plate, adorned with aromatic herbs and small fruits.  
It was a dish that could be called court cuisine, no, a work of art,
despite being outdoors.  
  
Beneath the crispy texture of the breading, was the sensation of meat
layered like a millefeuille.  
With each bite, a good amount of oil and meat juice overflowed, melting
in her mouth.  
How could such tough meat become so tender?  
Each movement of her mouth released more flavor, and the scent of herbs
tantalized her appetite.  
The lightness and richness of the different sauces created a refreshing
acidity and a deep richness, and the carefully seasoned salt painted a
rainbow-like gradient on her tongue.  
  
Some of the Royal Knights eating it were stunned, others devoured it
frantically. It was a truly demonic dish worthy of an evil dragon.  
The more they ate, the more their stomachs pleaded for more.  
Even Lilybell, who had lived a modest life considering her position as a
princess and had tasted gourmet food, was captivated by this culinary
magic.  
  
—So that's why they weren't warriors, but maids.  
She thought this nonsensical thought, then, noticing a gaze, looked at
Yuri.  
Yuri's eyes, often described as sharp, were soft, and a gentle smile
played on her lips.  
  
"Y-Yuri...?"  
"No... it's just been a long time... since I've seen your Highness's
face so genuinely happy while eating."  
  
Her cheeks flushed at those words, and Yuri took a handkerchief,
tenderly wiping Lilybell's mouth.  
  
"You even got sauce on your mouth... it's like you've returned to your
childhood."  
"Uu..."  
  
Yuri chuckled, shaking her shoulders with happiness, and Lilybell's face
grew even redder.  
Yaquai, who had been observing from a slightly distant seat, pressed the
corner of his eyes as if to hold back hot tears.  
  
"Ah... Goddess Yulin. To this old man, who only awaits death, what a
beautiful light of Aena you show me..."  
  
He calmed his heart, regulated his breathing, and slowly nodded as if
savoring the emotion that filled his chest.  
He clasped his hands together, looked up, and gazed at the sky.  
  
"Thank you, Goddess Yulin."  
  
Then he cast his gaze upon the cutlet in front of him and looked at the
cheerful heroes.  
  
"The truth is, while Krische-sama and the others were dismembering, I
secretly prepared a dessert using the fruits from here."  
"Ooh..."  
"Every single time, it's the same kind of surprise; it's quite
unoriginal. I figured you'd start slacking off partway through and
something like this would happen."  
"Well, that's harsh."  
  
The three, huddled together, also emitted the beautiful light of Aena.  
The radiance emitted by the princesses and their attendants of both
worlds, so noble and beautiful, illuminated the Tautoki Kingdom.  
  
"...Thank you, Hero."  
  
He took a bite of the cutlet, filled with the revered radiance of
Aena.  
His chest was filled with layers upon layers of Goddess Yulin's
millefeuille.  
  
It was a supreme dish, colored with an indescribable love. 
<br /><br />

  
"...Puririn, it's time to say goodbye to Krische and the others, but
live well."  
  
—And so, the next day, the time for farewell arrived.  
Before a large door that appeared in the air.  
The reddish slime, held by Lilybell, was gently stroked by the
silver-haired girl, trembling in tiny quivers as if trying to hold back
sadness.  
  
"It's strange, isn't it? Even though we shouldn't understand each
other's words, when I hold this one, I feel like its feelings are
conveyed. ...This one is sad to say goodbye too."  
"I actually hesitated whether to take her back with us... but Bery and I
talked about it, and we decided it's best for this world's inhabitants
to stay in this world."  
  
Releasing her hand, the girl smiled at Lilybell.  
  
"Lilybell-san, please take care of Puririn."  
"Yes. ...I will treasure her as a precious charge."  
  
Lilybell also smiled, then bowed deeply.  
  
"Hero... Krische-sama, truly... truly, thank you very much."  
  
Having finished breakfast, Hero Bery, holding Kreschenta who was
sleeping soundly and happily, shook her head with a troubled
expression.  
  
"No, not at all... Everything was thanks to Krische-sama's efforts, and
during the journey, both Krische-sama and I, thanks to all of you, had a
wonderful trip... Oh, no, perhaps saying that is rude..."  
"Not at all. I never imagined that the terrifying journey to subjugate
the evil dragon would become so filled with smiles. ...Everyone is truly
grateful for that."  
  
She spoke, then smiled at Yuri beside her.  
She likewise smiled and nodded.  
  
"You said 'not overtly,' but... if you have the chance, please visit
this land anytime. Next time you come, not as heroes, but as travelers,
please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content. I believe the world you
saved is worthy... a beautiful place."  
"Yes, if we have the chance, we definitely will."  
  
And so the heroes exchanged a few more words with the others, and the
three people and one creature returned beyond the door.  
The princess, who remained asleep throughout—it was never clear until
the end why she had visited this world, but in light of this outcome, it
was a minor detail.  
  
The complete subjugation of the evil dragon, Ojiros.  
The great journey, deeply etched into the historical records of the
Tautoki Kingdom, thus came to an end.  
  
"Princess! A stray dragon has appeared...!"  
"Yuri, I'm coming too!"  
"Yes!"  
"Puririn, you—...Understood, you'll fight for us too, won't you?"  
  
Even with Ojiros defeated, not all threats from monsters were gone.  
  
"Amazing... this is the power of a level 113 Dragonblood Slime..."  
"To overwhelm a dragon... don't let Puririn steal all the glory! Cover
me, you lot!"  
  
However, the Royal Knights, who had learned the swordsmanship of another
world, and the anti-dragon, anti-monster tactics spread throughout the
kingdom by them, bravely confronted the threat. Aided by Puririn and its
kin, the hero's friend would later be praised as the guardian deity of
the Tautoki Kingdom.  
To protect the peace the heroes built and make it eternal.  
  
The clutches of Senky will likely never disappear from this world.  
Eternal peace may never come—but as long as their faith in the goddess
remains strong, they can continue to resist it.  
Princess Lilybell, who was married to the captain of the Royal Knights,
told her people this.  
  
"Ehehe, Puririn is called a guardian deity now, it seems."  
"My goodness..."  
"She's grown so much. She used to be small like these ones..."  
"The slimes, or whatever these monsters are, keep following me just from
walking... What are they?"  
"Puririn's friends? It seems."  
  
Watching them from afar, the eternal travelers continued their
journey.  
With arms linked, gazing at the surrounding scenery.  
  
It was a flower field far removed from the world covered in Senky.  
Blooming were the six-petaled flowers called Aena.  
  
"Even so, this area is a beautiful flower field all over, isn't it?"  
"Yes, it's incredibly beautiful."  
  
In their world,  
  
"There are so many lily flowers."  
  
That's what those beautiful flowers were called. 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

 
<br /><br />

  
To be continued… (It won't be).  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Bonus*** 
<br /><br />

Meanwhile, in another world.  
  
"Absolutely not! Why do I have to be in some drama?!"  
"Romance between women is very popular these days, you see. This
'Birdcage Series' in particular is quite a hit even in the Fairy
Realm."  
  
Selene waved the project proposal in her hand, glaring at the winged
insect: Queen Kreschenta, who was perched regally on Krische's head, who
was sitting on Bery, who was sitting on the living room sofa.  
  
"It has absolutely nothing to do with magical girls!"  
"It does! Who do you think allows you to be a magical girl?"  
"Who asked you to?! I'd quit being a magical girl right now if I
could!"  
"N-now, now, Ojou-sama..."  
  
When Bery spoke to soothe her, Kreschenta looked at her.  
  
"Oh, is that so? Magical Bery, please retrieve the copy of the contract
Magical Selene signed the other day."  
"...Um, the one for the voice acting?"  
  
Bery retrieved the contract copy from thin air and brought it before
Kreschenta.  
Kreschenta lightly leaped up, scattering sparkling scales—and shining
letters appeared in the blank space.  
  
"See here. Magical Selene is currently a talent belonging to Fairy
Production. If she quits being a magical girl on her own, I will demand
compensation for damages—"  
"That's obviously invalid! That's a fraud contract!"  
"I don't know about your laws, but it's perfectly legal in the Fairy
Realm. It's the fault of those who are deceived."  
"You pest...!"  
  
As Selene pulled out her magical spray, Kreschenta fluttered and hid
behind Krische's shadow.  
  
"Violence should be forbidden here too!"  
"Pest control is legal!"  
"O-oh, both of you, calm down..."  
"Why have you been taking this bug's side all this time?! There's no
doubt that bug is unilaterally in the wrong!"  
"W-well, that's true, but..."  
  
Bery said, looking troubled, and Selene frowned.  
  
"It's fine for you, isn't it? You're the kind of person who can
cheerfully say *'Magical Girl Magical Bery has arrived!'* in that
frilly, girlish outfit at your age. Do you even know the meaning of
shame?"  
"I-I don't think that's a line one should say to Ojou-sama, who is no
longer of 'girlish' age..."  
"I'm! Doing it! Unwillingly!"  
  
Selene raised her voice, then pulled Krische's cheek, who frowned in
annoyance even while sleeping.  
  
"Unnnh?!"  
"Honestly, how can you sleep so peacefully in this situation?"  
  
Krische, whose cheek was released with a *smack*, rubbed it in
confusion. Bery looked at Selene reproachfully after witnessing this.  
  
"...Ojou-sama, don't take it out on—"  
"Krische is totally involved in this too. Anyway, I absolutely,
positively refuse, even if it kills me. You three can happily do
whatever you want."  
  
With that, as if her anger wouldn't subside, Selene stomped up the
stairs and slammed her bedroom door shut, secluding herself.  
  
"Honestly, Magical Selene is truly short-tempered."  
"Well, I think it's understandable for Ojou-sama to be angry... Are you
okay?"  
"Ehehe... yes."  
  
Bery replied as she rubbed Krische's cheek.  
  
"It's your fault, Magical Bery."  
"I-is it my fault...?"  
"Yes, it is. I plan to move forward seriously with this around next
month, so you need to persuade Magical Selene by then."  
"That seems a bit difficult..."  
"The word 'impossible' is not in my dictionary."  
  
"It's in mine, though," Bery sighed.  
  
"...? What was Selene angry about today?"  
"Well, it's... a complicated situation, both deep and not so deep,
perhaps..."  
  
Bery gently stroked Krische's tilted head and shook her own.  
  
A few days later, while watering the flowerbed, struggling with Selene
who was still sulking and not speaking to her, Bery felt a gaze and
looked towards the gate.  
There stood a woman wearing glasses, with black hair tied back, dressed
in a kimono.  
  
"H-hello..."  
"Anne-sama, how was your trip?"  
"Um... yes, it was very meaningful... And this, it's a souvenir for
Ariga-sama and family."  
"My, my... thank you."  
  
She was a resident of the house next door, and though Bery hadn't heard
the details, she apparently worked as a writer now.  
Her parents had moved back to their hometown for work, but she seemed to
really like it here and decided to live alone.  
  
They shared hobbies like kimonos, flowers, and cooking, and were
probably quite close among neighbors.  
Even now, they exchanged souvenirs whenever one of them went out.  
  
"Where did you go, th—"  
  
*Gasp*, before she could finish her sentence, Bery lost her words gazing
at the contents of the paper bag.  
Inside were Fairy Manju—souvenirs sold in the Fairy Realm.  
*Flutter*, *flutter*, *flutter*, Kreschenta appeared from behind,
perched on Anne's shoulder, and puffed out her chest.  
  
"K-Kreschenta-sama...?"  
"I'm the original author."  
"...Eh?"  
"Didn't you think the characters in 'Birdcage' resembled you all quite a
bit?"  
"Uh, um..."  
  
Bery looked at Anne, who raised her head with a tense expression.  
  
"M-Magical Bery Series... I-I've seen every episode."  
"Eh, eh...?"

*TN: The dragon's name, Ojirus, is probably based on Oji-san (old man).
Definitely a lot of other wordplay, probably. I think Senky (センキィ)
for old man smell, the mountain Chieu-Nhen (チウ＝ネーン) for oldness,
etc, but I'm stupid, so maybe, maybe not.*
