## Chapter 327: The Creation of Heaven and Earth, an Eternity of Journey IV

The mansion is a paradise, a paragon of beauty.  
Bathing together is commonplace; I usually bathe with Selene-sama.
However, Selene-sama sometimes bathes with Argan-sama and the others, or
sometimes she prefers to bathe alone. In those cases, I bathe with
Elvena-sama and Lira-sama.  
  
"Is something wrong…?"  
"Oh, I’m sorry. I… I was just… captivated…"  
"Ah… Hehe, no, it’s not like it will diminish if you look. If it’s for
reference for your books, then look all you like."  
  
Lira-sama, washing her body, answered with a smile.  
A girl-like beauty, with a physique overflowing with feminine charm
similar to Argan-sama’s.  
Her healthily tanned skin and the contrast of her chest and waist,
usually covered by cloth, were breathtakingly beautiful. A truly
attractive woman, with a figure as curvaceous as Argan-sama’s. The
difference from Argan-sama is that she readily shows her naked body with
a smile. Perhaps it’s a cultural difference, but Lira-sama had little
resistance to showing her skin.  
  
Elvena-sama, washing her body next to her, was the same.  
She displayed her slender, alluringly curvaceous body without
hesitation.  
It was as if she was saying, "Please, look all you like," and even when
I cast an indiscreet gaze, she didn't seem to mind, only offering a wry
smile.  
  
—On her left shoulder was still a distorted star-shaped tattoo.  
  
I had been told that it was based on each individual's perceived
physical prime. I distinctly remember Elvena-sama saying, laughing, that
if she wanted it gone, Krische-sama could remove it at any time, but
that it was a part of who she was.  
A brand marking her time as a slave—certainly not a pleasant memory.
When I, out of misplaced concern, asked if she was sure she was okay
with it, she replied happily that it was something that connected her
and her sister.  
She said she cherished all memories, both sad and happy, and her manner
was so beautiful that her words were deeply imprinted on my heart.  
  
Elvena-sama is that kind of person, and so is Lira-sama.  
They are the type of people who would spend decades alone in the forest,
simply to stand as a testament. Everyone here possesses an overwhelming
self-discipline, far surpassing that of an ordinary person like me, and
I believe that is also the reason for their beauty.  
Apart from the aura they exude, their way of life and mindset are
reflected in their appearance.  
  
For example, even if I had Argan-sama’s appearance, I wouldn’t look
nearly as attractive. But conversely, if Argan-sama had my appearance,
she would undoubtedly still look far more attractive than I do now. I
thought my own appearance wasn't bad, that I was at least moderately
attractive, but inner beauty is unrelated to that.  
Even if it were a rough, unpolished rock, not a gem, it could be carved
and refined into a magnificent sculpture, and this mansion is a
gathering of such people.  
  
And I, a fortunate human being, am allowed to gaze upon these
exquisitely carved gems, these sculptures, every day.  
I can't think of another person in the world who could feel such
happiness. I could only feel grateful for my ordinariness at such times.
Of course, there were times when I longed for such beauty and charm—but
now I think this: It’s because I am an ordinary person that I can feel
such profound emotion. The people of the mansion are basically unaware
of how magnificent they are.  
  
Their appearance, their kind hearts, even their slightest gestures—every
aspect is enough to surprise an ordinary person, to captivate and
enchant them. Yet, for these people, it's all commonplace. They don't
understand how beautiful they truly are.  
The fact that I, in this mansion, am allowed to understand this and
still gaze upon them makes me unbelievably happy.  
It’s as if I’m watching an opera every day. Just bathing with them is an
encounter with art itself.  
  
Like the fairies and alluring maidens encountered by lost travelers in
myths and legends from around the world—now, in reality, they are
exactly that, yet they are unaware.  
As the sole traveler who has stumbled upon their world, I find my days
temptingly alluring.  
  
After rinsing off the soap, I soaked in the bath, and I was asked about
the books I read. I ended up talking about those things.  
  
"—Everyone says it’s uneventful and meaningless, but for me, every day
is filled with small moments of wonder. Waking up in the morning,
exchanging greetings, eating together, and bathing together… in each of
these things, there’s always a small discovery or a moment of wonder."  
"I see…"  
  
Lira-sama, with her ample bosom bobbing gently, chuckled.  
  
"Fufu, you truly do possess the blood of Giterns-sama, don't you,
Anne-sama?"  
"My father’s…?"  
"Yes. He was someone who looked at people and things so honestly and
straightforwardly. The warriors of Kre'Sharana, as well as their lords,
often told young people to learn from his example."  
  
Lira-sama scooped up some of the faintly reddish water, forming a
waterspiegel with her hands.  
She gazed at my reflection, her eyes narrowing.  
  
"Even a turbulent, muddy river, within stillness, becomes a mirror.
Water is always just water; everything depends on the heart of the
beholder. …To revere a simple day, to show sincere respect for others,
and be moved by their kindness. To be able to speak of such things as
simply beautiful is because your heart, Anne-sama, is beautiful."  
"S-such…"  
  
My cheeks flushed at her words, and Lira-sama laughed nostalgically.  
  
"Giterns-sama was like that too. Even when facing unjust malice and
harsh words from outsiders of the plains, he would smile and speak only
of the beauty of Kre'Sharana… until eventually, even those people came
to admire him. He truly loved people."  
  
Lira-sama’s smile possessed the gentle quality befitting a Holy Spirit
Priestess.  
She spoke in a calm, soft voice, rippling the pale red surface of the
water, and gazed at me directly.  
  
"I respect Giterns-sama, and I respect you, Anne-sama, as well. To be
able to speak of others with such natural kindness and smiles is
something one can only dream of… Hehe, if you feel something about us,
it's the same as what we feel towards you."  
  
Then, Lira-sama turned her gaze to Elvena-sama, seeking agreement.  
  
"Yes, truly… Fufu, if Anne-sama is truly ordinary, a common person who
could be anywhere, then the other world would be a paradise just like
this one. Anne-sama, who says we underestimate ourselves, is the one
underestimating herself."  
  
Elvena-sama gently stirred the water, approaching me, and placed both
hands on my cheeks.  
Her face was so close, our noses almost touching.  
  
"E-Elvena-sama…?"  
  
As I froze, she smiled and peered into my eyes.  
Her long, dark brown eyes were surprisingly deep, beautiful, and
captivating.  
  
"Anne-sama possesses everything I lack. I’m sure Bery-sama feels the
same way… From our perspective, Anne-sama appears to be a very beautiful
person."  
  
Even her wet body and dripping droplets were beautiful.  
She was the spitting image of Kalua-sama, a vivacious beauty. But I
wondered if it was just the difference in their souls, as she seemed
like a completely different person, Elvena-sama exuding a charm that
made my heart flutter involuntarily.  
  
"Just as what is commonplace for Bery-sama is not necessarily so for
Anne-sama. What is commonplace for Anne-sama is not commonplace for us.
You are beautiful, always dazzling, to the point where I feel my eyes
might be blinded if I gaze directly at you…"  
  
A voice like a whisper, tickling my ears.  
I couldn't look away, and when she caressed my cheek, my heart felt like
it might burst. Elvena-sama narrowed her eyes playfully, then gently
moved away and returned to Lira-sama’s side.  
I remained frozen, gazing at Lira-sama, who was similarly frozen with
her mouth agape and her face crimson.  
  
Meanwhile, Elvena-sama smiled serenely, tilting her head as if to ask,
"Is something wrong?"  
There wasn’t a trace of malice in her expression—seeing this, I
submerged myself in the bath to calm my heart.  
  
This was something Elvena-sama did from time to time.  
I should get used to it, I thought, pinching my cheeks, squeezing my
eyes shut underwater, then surfacing again.  
  
"…?"  
  
Elvena-sama was still smiling brightly, questioning me with her gaze.  
  
"N-no. Nothing…"  
  
I shook my head, and she replied as usual, "I see."  
The conversation immediately shifted to another topic—this mansion was a
wonderfully sweet and decadent place. This was just everyday scenery,
the very beginning. I can’t afford to be surprised every time.  
  
Even Kreschenta-sama, who usually complains and grumbles, once she
transforms into Kreschenta (dog)...  
  
"Woof…"  
"Oh my, how spoiled."  
  
Would show herself to be begging for kisses all day.  
Kreschenta (dog), being carried as usual, receiving kisses from
Argan-sama as she was carried to the upper floor. Lira-sama and I,
watching this after our bath, stood motionless for a while.  
  
"Fufu, I’ll go bake cookies."  
"O-oh, yes…"  
  
Then, Elvena-sama’s words brought us back to our senses, and we started
to move, going up the stairs with Argan-sama and the others to
Lira-sama’s room. Even after entering the room, there was an
indescribable silence. As if to break the awkward silence, Lira-sama,
settling onto a cushion, spoke.  
  
"S-so…, that… setting aside Krische-sama, the fact that Kreschenta-sama
behaves like that normally is… surprising, to say the least… I’m not
used to it."  
"M-my feelings… well… I was surprised the first time I saw it too."  
  
The memory of Krische-sama, incapacitated during the battle in Bernaich,
clinging to Argan-sama as if their skin would fuse together, showering
her with affection during the midst of the civil war. Lira-sama probably
felt the same way I did at that time.  
  
How many times have I experienced such surprises since coming to this
mansion? I’ve become quite accustomed to it. I can now take such sights
in stride, but Lira-sama, even after a year, still hasn’t gotten used to
it.  
Every time she sees a sight like that, an awkward atmosphere arises.  
  
Lira-sama was still wearing a kind of wrap around her chest and waist.  
She had made it herself from cloth and string and wore it like
underwear. Honestly, at first, I thought, with all due respect, that she
didn't have a concept of shame, but even Krische-sama kissing
Argan-sama, a common sight in this mansion (the frequency of witnessing
it likely exceeds twenty times a day on average), still bothers her
often.  
  
That's just how things are.  
It's probably just a difference in the standards of shame.  
The other day, when Argan-sama let her try on one of her dresses, she
blushed crimson at her reflection, acting as if she was naked.  
She doesn't mind showing her body, yet she's embarrassed in strange
situations—culture is a strange thing. Still, even Argan-sama behaves
that way normally, and she gets embarrassed in strange places, so
perhaps this is just how humans are.  
  
"S-somewhat… it’s hard to ask, but…"  
"Yes, what is it?"  
"In the Kingdom, is it common for women to, uh, engage in love… between
the same sex?"  
  
Seeing Lira-sama blush, I fell into thought.  
  
"It’s a complicated question… but it’s not forbidden. I’ve heard that
there are countries that prohibit same-sex love, but in Kre'Sharana,
perhaps…?"  
"No, it wasn’t explicitly forbidden. But it wasn't common…"  
"I see… But Alberan is relatively tolerant in that respect. There seem
to have been great people who loved the same sex, regardless of gender,
and there are several such tales in the songs of bards."  
  
I nodded, searching my memory.  
  
"Since no one in the mansion took a husband, such matters were
implicitly understood… Kalua-sama, Elvena-sama’s sister, also had a
female partner. This was publicly known and accepted by everyone. Both
of them were beautiful, so naturally, there were many gentlemen who were
disappointed…"  
"Is that so?"  
"Yes. At least, it wasn't viewed as something shameful. The mansion also
had issues with succession, and it was considered disrespectful to
gossip about Her Majesty's private life; it was simply not discussed
openly…"  
  
Although it wasn’t openly discussed, I heard a great deal of gossip,
half out of curiosity and as conversation starters.  
The other half concerned anxieties about the succession.  
  
"However, it’s true that it's generally disliked. Whether it's a
gentleman or a woman, one generally needs to have children to inherit
the house, and in that sense, loving someone of the same sex can become
a scandal. The longer a house endures, the more intense this aspect
is…"  
"I see…"  
"Conversely, aside from that aspect, it isn’t necessarily seen in a bad
light. Krische-sama and Argan-sama, after returning with the Holy Spirit
and awakening, exchanged a passionate kiss in front of many people…"  
"S-such a thing…?"  
  
I nodded.  
That sight must have been beautiful enough to frame, but missing it
still weighs on my mind.  
Of course, there were many other things happening at the time, so I
wasn’t able to focus on that.  
  
"It became a topic of conversation for a while, but there was no
resulting bad reputation. Selene-sama seemed to have resigned herself to
it; that’s how insignificant the matter was. Gallen-sama, Krische-sama’s
grandfather…"  
  
Saying that, I recalled the events of that time.  
I suddenly pictured Gallen-sama’s kind, smiling face. 
<br /><br />

  
—This happened around the time the Five Nations War ended.  
  
Gallen-sama didn’t live in the first-class city district but in a castle
town.  
A single room in an apartment building—only a dining area and a bedroom;
for his position, it was small and cramped.  
It was a well-maintained apartment building, but Gallen-sama was the
deputy commander of the Alberinea direct-rule army. This was not the
type of accommodation one would expect for someone of his standing.  
  
The inside of the room was also simple, devoid of decorations.  
Only two potted plants, left behind by Krische-sama and Argan-sama when
they visited, because it looked too lonely. The prominent things were a
bow, arrows, a sword, armor, and a whetstone.  
Besides the pre-installed chairs and table, bed and dresser, there
wasn't any other furniture.  
  
Krische-sama and Selene-sama apparently suggested that they all live
together, but Gallen-sama apparently worried about causing inconvenience
due to hygiene problems. The issue of waste disposal was indeed a major
problem when aristocrats and commoners lived together. However, even
aristocrats relieved themselves as children and, although less
frequently, some did even as adults. There were cesspools in the royal
territory, and when I worked at the Irne mansion, waste disposal was
part of the job. Argan-sama and I didn’t mind, but he seemed hesitant. 
<br /><br />

According to Argan-sama, he himself had been handling those matters
since the days of the old Christand Mansion.  
Perhaps a place like this, built and managed with that understanding,
feels more comfortable for him.  
Many noble families strongly dislike such things as unclean – sadly,
some unbelievably arrogant people even go so far as to openly say that
commoners are no better than livestock, aspiring to be nobles.  
  
Gallen-sama, considering his age and various circumstances, seemed to
have taken great care not to cause trouble to Krische-sama and the
Christand family.  
It was probably the result of much consideration.  
  
Because of that, Gallen-sama lived in the town’s apartment complex.  
While Krische-sama and I were of course disappointed, it’s also true
that I'm relieved to avoid being scolded for my constant clumsiness.  
  
Gallen-sama, being a country-bred hunter, said he didn't mind my
carelessness. He truly doesn't seem to notice my blunders, saying,
"Think of it as practice, since it's not the mansion," and always
smiling when I apologize. He said I'm much more skillful than his wife
and daughter, and seemed delighted, reminiscing while telling old
stories, regardless of what I do.  
  
Even if I break a plate or a pot, he first checks if I'm hurt.  
Argan-sama laughs and forgives my clumsiness, saying, "Things break; it
can't be helped."  
Yet, Argan-sama herself never makes a single mistake.  
Working in the mansion with her is a little nerve-wracking (a negative
loop where my nervousness leads to more mistakes), but Gallen-sama
probably understands that.  
He always uses kind words to ease my tension. Although I wonder if I'm
relying on him too much, when it's just the two of us, I feel calmer and
can work more steadily.  
  
I offered Gallen-sama some black bean tea after he folded a letter from
Selene-sama.  
After thanking me, he spoke up.  
  
"I'd like to think about my reply to Selene... will you be back soon?"  
"No. Her Majesty is resting today...if Gallen-sama doesn't mind, I'd
like to make dinner again… Kalua-sama will be picking up Elvena-sama and
stopping by on her way back, and she’ll take me home in the evening."  
"I see…then I’ll gratefully accept your offer. You should have some
too."  
"…Yes."  
  
I smiled as I poured myself some black bean tea. He seems to eat out
often, going to pubs with people or buying from street vendors.  
He cooks sometimes when he has time, but he’s getting on in years.  
I thought it would be best to feed him delicious, nutritious food, so I
often brought him meals on my errands, but…  
  
"‘Krische is little worried, but Anne isn't that bad at cooking, and
Grandfather seems to like it…’"  
  
After receiving those words from Krische-sama, I’ve been tasked with
making dinner occasionally whenever I run errands for Gallen-sama.  
  
In the mansion, cooking is a special job, separate from all others.  
Usually only Argan-sama is allowed to do it, with Krische-sama assisting
and learning, making it a very sacred task (at least, that's how
Krische-sama seems to see it).  
There’s nothing more fulfilling than being entrusted with such a duty.  
  
My feelings must have shown on my face.  
I apologized to Gallen-sama who was chuckling, enjoying the cookies and
black bean tea as we talked. We discussed things about the mansion and
Krische-sama.  
  
"–The dragon…ah, when Krische-sama returned with the Holy Spirit, I
somehow found myself clutching a frying pan, ready to defend Argan-sama…
Looking back, I was incredibly foolish. What was I thinking, facing
something that could blow up the entire mansion?"  
"Kuku, but when something unexpected happens, that's just how it is… I
was aiming my bow at that giant thing from atop the watchtower, so I
can't laugh at you."  
  
What she had witnessed was the aftermath of Krische-sama and Argan-sama
leaving.  
From the city walls surrounding the royal territory, its enormous size
was clearly visible.  
It was as big as a castle, and I was shocked that something like that
existed. Even if Gallen-sama was a master archer, I didn't think his
arrows would have any effect.  
  
"Gallen-sama was there too?"  
"Yes, I was working inside for a bit. I thought that if things came to
it, I should at least fire a shot, but luckily there was no need for
that… I was relieved."  
"I see… hehe, Elvena-sama and I could only look at the Holy Spirit from
afar. Now I think, if only we had chased after it, no matter what…–ah"  
  
I stopped short.  
Gallen-sama being there means he must know about their kiss.  
No, he probably saw it.  
No one said it explicitly, but there was an unspoken agreement in the
mansion not to talk about it in front of Gallen-sama, and lately things
have been hectic. I had completely forgotten, but it is a very awkward
topic.  
  
I cursed myself for blurting it out, my eyes darting around.
Gallen-sama, looking at me and tilting his head, smiled
understandingly.  
  
"Don't worry about it. …It truly delights me that Krische has found
someone she loves so deeply. The same goes for Bery… both of my
granddaughters are capable of handling many things easily, but they're
even more clumsy than that."  
  
He smiled gently.  
  
"Krische is a childlike granddaughter, in both good and bad ways. You
understand since you live with her, right?"  
"…Yes."  
  
Krische-sama would probably be furious, but I can't deny it. It's the
truth, and I love that aspect of her.  
  
"I think love comes in many forms. A child's love for their parent, a
parent's love for their child, the love between siblings, or the love
towards a friend. Krische wasn’t unfamiliar with love. But a child's
love is passive and self-centered… it's simply a matter of returning
love for love. …But the love Krische has for Bery is different."  
  
Gazing at the black bean tea, Gallen-sama narrowed his eyes. Then, he
quietly poured milk, drawing circles on the surface, something he
doesn’t usually do.  
  
"It's not just about accepting love, or simply returning love for love.
I was a little worried about whether she could one day generate love
from within herself and direct it towards someone else. Love for love,
hostility for hostility – like a mirror, or to put it negatively, a lack
of self-agency. Her purity, conversely, was a reflection of coldness. If
you aren't loved, you can't even love someone."  
  
He stirred the white into the dark surface, gradually changing the color
of the tea to a light brown.  
  
"That's why I was so happy. Seeing Krische lose herself, crying and
laughing for someone… At that moment, she was truly an ordinary girl,
nothing special, just like any other…"  
  
He took a sip of the now neither black nor white tea and smiled.  
  
"Bery is a thoughtful and good girl. She understands right and wrong,
and reason well. If the person she loves is like that, she will surely
support and guide Krische, filling in what's lacking, and leading her in
a good direction. And since Krische chose such a person, I, as her
grandfather, have nothing to say… I bless them from the bottom of my
heart."  
"Gallen-sama…"  
  
The expression on Gallen-sama's face was the gentlest I'd ever seen. He
spoke from the heart, as a grandfather truly should.  
I felt foolish for worrying about what he thought of their relationship.
He truly cares for Krische-sama.  
  
"When Krische eventually brings home a lover, I was thinking of punching
that person at least once… kuku, while I'm happy, there's a part of me
that feels sad."  
"P-punch…?"  
"Even I have a bit of longing for those silly things. In the end, even
when my daughter brought home her husband, I only thought about it, I
never did it. I neglected them so much, now I can’t act like a dignified
father."  
  
He said so with a regretful yet bright smile, implying that such an
opportunity was unlikely to come again.  
  
"Well, don’t worry about me. Since it’s not a man, and it’s Bery, you
may have been worried, but… I’m not surprised. In a way, I somehow had a
feeling about it. The same should be true for you, living with them…"  
"That’s… yes."  
  
It seems natural, considering what I’ve seen of them.  
Especially since she returned from her hometown, it’s become even
clearer. She said something like, "I’ve learned what ‘beautiful’ means,"
and that is probably the most obvious change. But those of us who lived
in the mansion had a sense of what that "beauty" was all about.  
  
Krische-sama only saw jewels as rare and valuable stones. She wasn't
interested in the sparkle, the clarity, or the kind of beauty we usually
associate with them. The same was true for flowers, stars, and
scenery.  
Therefore, the "beauty" that she spoke of was not something simple; it
must contain various meanings.  
  
Like a kiss that carries so much meaning, Krische-sama's beauty is
special.  
When she talked about beauty and looked at Argan-sama, her gaze was like
that. They didn't talk much about what happened during their return
trip, but something significant must have happened.  
  
Many things have happened since then, but finally everything seems
settled. Seeing them so happy, I’m just relieved.  
  
"…They truly are a perfect match. Argan-sama serving Krische-sama… I'm
here because of what I saw in those two."  
  
Gallen-sama nodded happily, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  
  
"That child has truly begun to offer love of her own accord. Status and
gender fade before such great joy. There can be nothing more important
than fulfilling your love, and if she has found someone like that…"  
  
He looked into the distance, lost in thought.  
  
"There aren't many things we can gain in life. People aren’t perfect,
and we make mistakes. We might even let go of many things in pursuit of
something great."  
  
But the truly important things are few, he continued.  
  
"But Krische will understand that. Unlike me, she won't let them slip
through her fingers, she’ll cherish them. If she desires it, I have
nothing more to say, only to offer prayers for her future."  
  
He looked straight into my eyes.  
  
"She is surrounded by kind people. In that sense, I don't worry. For
that unusual child, it is not only Bery who teaches and gives her
ordinary happiness, but you are one of them as well."  
"S-such… I…"  
"Your self-deprecation includes many things Krische lacks. In that
mansion, you possess more of what my granddaughter wants to convey than
anyone else."  
  
He looked at me with gentle eyes, pointed at my head with his finger.  
  
"The important things aren’t here…"  
  
Then, as if saluting,  
  
"—They've always been here."  
  
He placed his hand on his chest and smiled. 
<br /><br />

  
"Gallen-sama… told me all that…"  
"Y-yes. Ah…the towel…"  
"I'm sorry, thank you…"  
  
I wiped away my tears with the towel and caught my breath.  
  
"…The conversation went off track a little…"  
"N-no, it’s fine…"  
  
Smiling faintly and gently stroking my back, Lira-sama continued.  
  
"But…yes. After hearing such a story, I've been thinking…it might be an
incredibly rude question to ask what is generally considered normal."  
"No…it is natural to be perplexed when witnessing it for the first
time."  
"No, no, I was incredibly shallow-minded."  
  
Finally raising my head, Lira-sama returned to her cushion.  
She spoke thoughtfully.  
  
"…Regardless, it's irrelevant. Love transcends appearances and gender;
it's something woven beyond such things. This body's concept of gender
is meaningless; Krische-sama could even make us look like the Holy
Spirit if she wanted to, after all… she just gave us human bodies
again."  
"Oh, right…there was such a thing."  
  
Lira-sama chuckled. She came to the mansion to serve the Holy Spirit as
a Holy Spirit Priestess.  
Some time after coming here, Krische-sama asked her, as if remembering
something:  
  
‘By the way, Lira is currently in the same human body as before, what
should we do? If you’d prefer a body like Regalave-san’s, Krische could
prepare one…'  
  
It was a well-intentioned suggestion from Krische-sama. Lira-sama takes
things seriously.  
Krische-sama casually mentioned that Regalave-san might appreciate it
too.  
Lira-sama seriously pondered whether she should do so for three days…  
  
‘B-but Krische-sama, you just asked casually… don’t worry so much. I’m
sure Yagernaus-sama wouldn’t mind Lira-sama’s appearance. Besides,
Krische-sama is really looking forward to having you try her cooking,
and so am I…’  
‘B-but…’  
‘Yes, don’t worry about that child’s words. Uh, er, you see, it is
disrespectful for a priestess to imitate the appearance of the Holy
Spirit, is it not? Yes, yes. As a priestess, I think it's fine to remain
as you are. It’s your feelings that matter, if you have the feeling…’  
  
I still remember the incident where Krische-sama was persuaded by
Argan-sama and Selene-sama.  
  
If the Holy Spirit's form can be altered, changing to a different gender
would be even easier. In that sense, the concept of gender is indeed
meaningless here.  
  
"A cup may be different, but tea is still tea. Thinking that way, my
view was shallow. That is even more true since coming to this world.
Appearances are a trivial difference…in that sense, love is ultimately a
bond between souls."  
"…Yes."  
"Gallen-sama probably valued such things. Even though I should be far
older now, I'm ashamed of myself."  
  
As she said that, Elvena-sama enters carrying a tray of cookies.  
She tilted her head at the somewhat somber atmosphere and curiously
asked what we were talking about.  
Lira-sama explained a bit sheepishly, and Elvena-sama smiled
knowingly.  
  
"That's an interesting story. Whether it's common is debatable, but it's
not that unusual either. …In a way, it could be said that this is the
norm in this world."  
"The norm…?"  
"More than the norm, it's easier to think that way."  
  
Lira-sama, tilting her head, received a nod from Elvena-sama.  
  
"If we're going to spend eternity together, it's not something unrelated
to us, and it's better not to be bound by the common sense of that
world. In a way, we're no different from Krische-sama’s group…"  
  
Then, shyly placing a hand on her cheek and shifting her gaze, she
said,  
  
"…That is, we'll be spending an immeasurable amount of time together
from now on, and most things that could happen, will happen. For
example, the possibility of you two exchanging affections like that in
the future isn't completely zero, is it?"  
  
Such were the words she uttered.  
Lira-sama and I, momentarily frozen, exchanged glances, our faces
involuntarily flushing crimson—Elvena-sama continued to shyly fidget her
body from side to side.  
  
"In a thousand years, two thousand years, or even further into the
future, there's a possibility that we might even be among that circle…
Even if, by their standards, it's an undesirable, licentious
relationship, I… I want to accept that—that form of happiness
included—everything. 'Easygoing' means that."  
"I, I see…"  
"Fufu, it's kind of embarrassing to say this while sober."  
  
Even her sigh was somehow alluring.  
Glancing at me, Elvena-sama spoke.  
  
"In a sense, we will have a deeper relationship than a couple who have
spent a hundred years together. The more we come to know each other, the
deeper our feelings will become… Of course, we might have minor
arguments from time to time, but those in this mansion are all kind
people who wished for eternity with Krische-sama. Even if such a
relationship were to develop, it wouldn't be strange… Don't you think
so?"  
"…For now, it's too much for me to imagine, but certainly, the
possibility you mentioned isn't… it doesn't seem impossible."  
  
For a moment, I almost imagined myself kissing someone like
Krische-sama, and hastily shook my head.  
That said, the future is unknown—that's not what she's trying to say,
surely.  
  
Even if Elvena-sama were to kiss someone.  
While I might be surprised at first, I wouldn't look upon it with
disfavor.  
Lira-sama, too, blushed, nodding in agreement.  
  
"Besides, a kiss is just a touch of lips. In our culture, it's seen as a
sign of deep intimacy, but in some places it might be just a light
greeting. Depending on the culture…"  
"Ah…"  
"…holding hands might be the equivalent. Considering the various
cultures that exist depending on the land and customs, it's better to
accept things as they are in this world rather than being bound by the
common sense of that world."  
  
As she spoke, Elvena-sama gently squeezed Lira-sama's hand.  
Lira-sama stared at it with a crimson face—Elvena-sama looked at her
with a serious expression.  
  
"Love is the union of souls, what a lovely phrase… For us, who have
become souls, the body is certainly not the essence. Depending on how
you look at it, even a kiss might just be a little bit of physical
contact…"  
  
Then, lightly pulling on her hand, with a very natural movement, she
moved closer to Lira-sama.  
Lira-sama, noticing this, shifted her gaze.  
  
"Um, uhm…?"  
"Could you please stay still for a moment?"  
"Eh, eh…?"  
  
Ignoring the bewildered Lira-sama, Elvena-sama leaned in, bringing her
face closer.  
Lira-sama leaned back, her eyes widening as she stared at
Elvena-sama—seeing this, I also froze, breathless.  
  
"It's alright. I'm not going to do anything strange."  
"I, it's alright…?"  
"Yes, so just stay still…"  
  
Elvena-sama's left hand reached Lira-sama's right cheek, which Lira-sama
glanced at sideways.  
Looking at Elvena-sama, she watched the approaching face and serious
eyes, and closed her eyes as if resigned.  
I watched, mouth covered, dumbfounded—  
  
"…Huh?"  
  
I watched as Elvena-sama, having somehow produced a handkerchief, wiped
Lira-sama's mouth.  
Lira-sama, letting out a dazed voice, opened her eyes and looked at the
handkerchief, while Elvena-sama alone smiled happily.  
  
"Fufu, there was a bit of cookie crumbs on your mouth… It's all clean
now."  
  
Then, as if nothing had happened, she returned to her cushion, gazing
intently at us, who were frozen with crimson faces, and tilted her head
curiously.  
  
"Um… is something the matter?"  
"N, no, n-nothing…"  
"Y, yes, nothing… Ah, y-yes, I'll get you some more tea!"  
  
"Thank you very much," Elvena-sama said with a cheerful smile.  
Her usual gentle smile seemed even more joyful than usual.  
  
However, is it just me, or is it because my heart is impure that I
perceived it that way?
