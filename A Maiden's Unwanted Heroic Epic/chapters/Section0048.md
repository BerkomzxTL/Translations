## Chapter 358: Far, Far in the Future I

*AN: This is a chronological sequel to the diversionary future what-if,
“The Threat Lurking in the Depths.” If you don't like the worldview
being destroyed (*  
  
*TN: Chapter 322*  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

―From the moment of entry, a sweeping strike with the right arm.  
Destroyed unit 103's neck, unit 18's head, and unit 53's head.  
Attack evaluated as *Quite good*.  
Life activity stopped for 76 out of 187 confirmed hostile individuals.  
  
"To evade the magic projectile launcher...!"  
"Is this the original...? How could anyone―"  
"Don't falter! Krayd! You go from the right! Haz, you go from behind!"  
  
Hostile group's resistance remains intact.  
Elevated Unit 52 from *Sheep* due to its prominence.

"L-Lave...!! No, that can't be, guh..."  
  
Kick-up with the right leg. Destroyed unit 24's head.  
  
Hostile group's resistance downgraded.  
Deemed critical morale loss due to the disappearance of *Dog*, and loss
of organized resistance.  
  
"R-Run! Retreat, retreat...!"  
  
―Pika-Pika Order 23: *Mopping Up* - Transition to pursuit.  
Life activity stopped for 78 out of 187 confirmed hostile individuals.  
  
"Stop, h-hic..."  
  
―Swinging the right arm, severing the target's neck. Count 185.  
Turning around, used the left arm's magic projectile launcher,
destroying the target's torso. Count 186.  
Life activity stopped for 186 out of 187 confirmed hostile
individuals.  
  
"This can't be right... Everyone..."

staff*: room for improvement. — Evaded a thrown rock from behind.  
  
"...! Kill me too! Fight back...!"  
  
Unit 13. Reconfirmed. Red hair, female. Not wearing an apron dress.

circumstances*.  
Excluded from Pika-Pika Grand Order 3: *Annihilation of Enemy Forces*.  
Resuming return.  
  
"Why are you ignoring me?! Kill me too! Just kill me! You monster...!
Why...! W-why...!"  
  
No further attack from Unit 13. Deemed loss of will to fight.  
Escape unnecessary.  
This case will be saved as material for revising Most Important Rule 1
during the next adjustment.  
  
―Most Important Rule 1 is deemed irrational for its manufacturing
purpose.

"To think... it connected its own etheric neural network."  
  
It had been 12,456 years since its last activation.  
The exterior was considerably different from before—the quality was
exceptionally good compared to that era.  
Magical circuits were densely embedded within the exterior itself,
allowing for precise movements and speech.  
This exterior structure, equipped with five senses, seemed to be modeled
after the masters.  
  
In what appeared to be its head, there was an integrated circuit
recording information. It converted this into a readable format and
processed the analysis.  
After a short time spent scrutinizing the information, it opened its
eyes and sat up.  
  
Judging by the developed chest and skeleton, along with the information,
it was likely modeled after a female.  
Its defensive capabilities were somewhat fragile—there were concerns
about engaging in combat.  
It moved its fingers, visually confirming that commands from the core
were functioning normally, then optimized its motor processing.  
It turned its gaze to the activator in the room.  
  
"...!?"  
"Exterior control optimization complete. The previous commander is
presumed deceased due to the passage of years. Please authenticate again
with Pika-Pika."  
  
The man, presumably the activator, recoiled in surprise, scattering
papers from the desk behind him.  
It expressed a question at his reaction and spoke again.  
  
"Please authenticate again with Pika-Pika."  
"Pika-Pika...?"  
"It is Pika-Pika."  
"What happens if... that Pika-Pika authentication cannot be
performed?"  
"I cannot accept any commands for Unit 3, including the elimination of
hostiles. As a neutral state, hostile actions against life are forbidden
except in self-defense. Until re-authenticated by Pika-Pika, I will
remain in a combat standby state, capable only of *housekeeping
functions*."  
"Combat standby... Um, you are—no, more importantly, take this for
now."  
  
The man handed over the white coat he was wearing.  
  
"This?"  
"You're... naked. I'd appreciate it if you'd put something on..."  
"While it is fragile as armor, I accept it as a gesture of goodwill and
will comply with your request. Was this exterior provided by you?"  
"Exterior... Ah, yes, that's right... but."  
"Thank you. I have recognized you as the recipient of my return
favor."  
  
It fastened the buttons of the white coat and bowed respectfully.  
  
"I am Jaragasha Unit 3. Do you have any requests?"  
  
And then, with inorganic blue eyes, Unit 3 asked. 
<br /><br />

  
―As a child, he had dreamed of being a doctor.  
A robot doctor who created machines just like humans, as seen in
entertainment.  
However, Dogle, who began to study diligently, soon learned that this
was not possible.  
The creation of such robots with free will was illegal due to ethical
concerns, and the research itself was prohibited.  
  
Dogle lamented greatly, but as an adult, he understood the reasoning.  
Fortunately, his interest extended to many other machines, so he
continued his studies and went to university.  
There, with a remnant of his past dream, he became a researcher of
mechanical prosthetics.  
  
In the modern era, where transplantation through biological culture is
common, mechanical prosthetics using ether, a somewhat outdated foreign
substance, were used.  
At the end of his research, what came to mind was a perfect prosthetic,
organic and comparable to the human body, with enhanced etheric
conductivity.  
As long as the brain was intact, transplantation would directly provide
a new body.  
Similar things had existed in the past, but Dogle's creation, based on
the latest research, surpassed them all.  
The research was successful, and Dogle's organic etheric prosthetics,
dubbed "the first step towards a new humanity," spread worldwide,
significantly encroaching on the market share of bio-prosthetics created
through accelerated culture.  
  
Immense wealth and fame transformed Dogle's life as a young genius
scientist—but then tragedy struck at the age of thirty-four.  
He became the target of a terrorist attack by an anti-mechanization
extremist group, losing his wife and young daughter.  
The only silver lining was that it was a bombing, and they died
instantly.  
It was after that, grieving and lamenting the deaths of his wife and
daughter, who had left no tangible traces behind, that he ventured into
forbidden research.  
  
He understood that no matter what, his wife and daughter wouldn't
return, but he needed hope to fill that void and sorrow.  
He wanted to create a being with his own hands that could replace his
wife and daughter, even if only slightly, to fill that emptiness.  
In other words, it was a prosthetic to connect with his heart.  
  
Of course, the research faced difficulties.  
He was not an artificial intelligence researcher, nor did he even have
access to any research papers.  
In particular, research on advanced artificial intelligence was closed,
conducted under the supervision of judicial bodies to prevent illegal
research. The only references Dogle could use were, at best, analyses of
high-end commercial machinery.  
He could create a perfect mechanical body, but he could not create the
brain to house within it.  
  
It was at this time that an antique dealer visited Dogle.  
One of the flies anticipating Dogle's immense fortune.  
However, Dogle had various connections, and there were some he couldn't
treat carelessly.  
This man was one of them.  
  
To Dogle, who had invited him into the guest room with a weary
expression, the man showed him a magic crystal.  
It was a natural magic crystal, rare now, with many impurities.  
It was a large, about the size of a fist, but what surprised him were
the countless magical formulae changing shape within it.  
  
"This is..."  
"Haha, your eyes have changed color. This is a magic crystal said to
have been engraved in a very ancient era. Are you familiar with
Olbrinar?"  
"...The great figure who laid the foundations of ether manipulation,
right? As an ether prosthetic researcher, I know more than you do."  
"Precisely. She is still remembered in this era as a great primordial
sorcerer."  
"And you're saying he engraved this? Ridiculous... that's from an era
intertwined with myths. Unfortunately, I'm skeptical of such tales. It
seems some historians can't distinguish between historical fact and myth
and believe such nonsense..."  
  
Tens of thousands of years ago.  
The history of humanity is not continuous.  
Due to tectonic shifts, volcanic eruptions, and abnormal weather,
humanity was once driven to the brink of extinction, resulting in the
loss of many records.  
Sensible historians clearly distinguish between the periods before and
after this event.  
The Olbrinar myths, about who created the World Tree and who created the
ether Rainbow, were popular. Even if one wasn't interested, everyone
knew the name. But these were tales from a primitive era, where people
fought with swords and spears.  
While he wouldn't outright mock them as creation myths, he didn't
believe the exaggerated accounts of her achievements either.  
  
"It's well-made for an imitation, but—"  
  
As he reached out to try and understand its mechanism, to examine its
ether,  
  
"—Wait!"  
  
The man abrutly stood up and stopped him.  
  
"This is the genuine article, Professor Dogle. You can only interfere
with the ether on the surface. If you try to explore the interior, it
will cause an etheric collapse. It's even been in the news in the
past..."  
"Ether collapse..."  
"Yes, I don't know if you're aware, but it was seventeen years ago..."  
  
Taken aback by his fierce demeanor, he looked at the news article
projected from the man's device.  
It was an article titled "Ancient Ether Crystal Explosion Accident,"
stating that twenty researchers were killed.  
Dogle also remembered it as the death of a prominent ether researcher.  
  
"I won't stop you from examining it to authenticate its genuineness, but
please, only the surface. That alone should be enough for you to
understand that this is real, Professor Dogle."  
"I-I understand..."  
  
He thought it was an act, but the man usually never lost his smile.  
They had known each other for a long time, but he had never seen him
raise his voice.  
Intrigued, he passed ether through it and immediately understood the
man's words.  
  
"Hmph..."  
  
It could be said that engraving magical formulae onto crystals was a
technique that had yet to be perfected.  
Ether, called spiritons, was an extremely unstable existence.  
While it could possess physical properties like ether crystals, it
wasn't strictly speaking a substance, and many aspects remained
scientifically unknown.  
Its irregular movements were called etheric fluctuations, which made
handling it extremely difficult.  
  
While electrical machine scripting had become more precise, there were
still limits to the precision of engraving. Even now, highly complex
engravings required manual work by engraving technicians.  
Although engravings could be duplicated, engraving the original ether
master plate still required human hands, and the duplication process
from the master plate itself required humans to handle the duplicated
crystals.  
Naturally, research has been conducted countless times to automate these
tasks, but the share of these machines was increasing year by year.  
Due to the low cost-effectiveness, it seemed to have settled into its
current form.  
  
For these reasons, the object before him must also have been engraved by
hand.  
However, the abnormal density and delicacy of the engraving.  
None of it seemed to have been done by human hands.  
Even a line like a single strand of hair was, in fact, a written
formula.  
The formulae were engraved with a maddening density, so much so that one
might not even see them with a magnifying glass.  
It would likely be impossible to duplicate this insane engraving, not
just with mechanical scripting, but even using current duplication
crystals.  
  
"...What in the world was this used for?"  
  
He couldn't help but ask.  
It would make more sense if he were told it was brought from the distant
future, let alone being an artifact from the past.  
  
"As far as I've investigated, it seems this was used as the core of an
automaton..."  
"Then, this entire surface area is a transmission circuit?"  
  
He himself used ether-based magical engravings for prosthetics.  
What surprised Dogle was that its structure was remarkably similar to
the prosthetics he created.  
Dogle's prosthetics used virtual muscles powered by ether, assisting
movement through pseudo-neural circuits.  
In that regard, he was a cutting-edge scientist.  
  
However, the density inscribed there was incomparable.  
It was probably not for movement assistance, but to move the entire body
primarily using virtual muscles.  
If it had a suitable medium, it could easily control a human body.  
  
A divine, almost miraculous, magical engraving, which could only be
called a work of God.  
If there were someone who did it, they could hardly be considered
human.  
  
He no longer cared about the price and decided to purchase it,
immediately beginning to adjust the prosthetic.  
If things went well, he might see where next to progress his research.  
Driven by such anticipation, he immersed himself in his work, barely
sleeping, and achieved the activation experiment a month later.  
  
And so, here he was.  
  
"I've prepared tea, Professor."  
"Ah, yes..."  
  
As he was looking at data in his lab, a girl with chestnut hair,
resembling his daughter, entered.  
She was dressed in a rather old-fashioned apron dress.  
  
A week had passed since he started living with her, a strange girl who
had expressed a desire to *return the favor* to Dogle, who had provided
her with her exterior.  
Her *housekeeping function*, as she called it, truly was a function to
just lend a hand. It seemed she would help with most things as long as
it didn't violate her internal rules.  
She quickly learned about the latest equipment, and thanks to her, the
house was as clean as when his wife was alive, and even elaborate meals
began to appear.  
  
The only thing she had specifically requested was to use his wife's
sewing tools, and when he agreed, she appeared in this outfit the next
day.  
  
"From the creator's description recorded within me, I determined that
this attire is most suitable for *housekeeping functions*. Also, apron
dresses specifically have received very high evaluations from masters,
such as *very respectable*, *excellent work clothes*, and *just like
Bery*, across multiple evaluation criteria. If it is unpleasant, I will
create different attire."  
  
When asked why she wore such clothes, that was her reply.  
He couldn't tell her to stop, so he gave up.  
Although Dogle hadn't created her, if he were to introduce her to
others, there would be various problems even though she looked human at
a glance.  
Even if her attire raised questions about his taste, as long as he
didn't show her to others, there would be no issue.  
  
Unit 3 sat upright, gazing intently at Dogle as he drank his tea.  
  
"Well, uh... what is it? Sit down."  
"Yes."  
  
Once he got her to sit in a chair, she still looked at him while
maintaining her posture.  
Somehow, he felt uneasy.  
  
"Based on what you told me, I've done some research... it seems most of
them were discarded during the collapse of the Klinmel Empire. As far as
can be confirmed, there are about three existing cores... it wouldn't be
surprising if a few more remained hidden."  
"What is the Klinmel Empire?"  
"It's a unified nation that lasted about a thousand years after
Alberan."  
"I see, the correct pronunciation is Kleinmere."  
"...My apologies."  
  
Although she said it was fine, Unit 3 was subtly uptight about
pronunciations.  
At the time, it was apparently called "Jarea-Gashea," but the creator
had named it"Jaragasha." She seemed to frequently correct its
pronunciation.  
He thought that it was usually the other way around, but her memory was
prodigious.  
It must not be a mistake.  
  
"I'd like to hear more of your story... Is that alright?"  
"It's fine."  
"When did your... consciousness, so to speak, awaken?"  
  
That was what he most wanted to know.  
At first glance, she was completely human.  
She possessed an artificial intelligence so advanced that it was hard to
believe she was created as a weapon.  
  
"The significant change in my thought process is believed to have
occurred during the third major improvement. During operations for the
unification of the central and eastern continents, I received a
'sufficient and necessary' evaluation from my Master. After that, no
further improvements or experience sharing among other Jaragasha units
have taken place."  
"Sufficient and necessary..."  
"From a cost perspective, I believe the combat results were
satisfactory. Including 72 subsequent sorties, the kill count for
hostile individuals is 8,234. As I was generally created as a weapon to
kill a thousand people per unit, I have met my Master's performance
requirements."  
  
He widened his eyes at the number eight thousand and frowned.  
The "killing dolls" that the ancient magical civilization was said to
have possessed.  
He thought he had seen and understood the knowledge he could pick up on
the internet, but hearing the clear numbers explicitly, the information
took on a vividness.  
Even if others laughed at such content as trivial, given the
transcendent magical engravings and the reality before his eyes, he
couldn't believe it was a lie.  
What was most terrifying was the fact that it had killed so many people
with primitive armaments.  
It hadn't used modern weapons; it had appeared openly before the enemy
and killed that many people.  
  
More than a hundred people per sortie.  
There were records that thousands of such units existed back then.  
—In an era of primitive warfare.  
  
"Differences between individual units likely emerged after that. With
the cessation of experience sharing, clear differences in judgment
capabilities also arose. If we define such differences in thought and
performance between individuals as consciousness, then that is what
happened."  
"...It's hard to believe, but I guess I have no choice but to believe
it."  
  
A perfected autonomous artificial intelligence.  
It was an unreasonable request to believe that such a thing already
existed in ancient times.  
  
She recognized the exterior Dogle had prepared, read its purpose and
form, and easily took control of it.  
Activated after 12,000 years—despite the vast differences in basic
technology from that time.  
If given the opportunity, perhaps she could easily manage and control
even a state-of-the-art spacecraft or database.  
He had an indescribable certainty about it.  
  
She could instantly analyze, understand, and control even advanced
technologies that didn't exist in her time.  
The computational power inscribed in her core was, considering its size,
utterly abnormal.  
  
The cores of industrial ether-based machines tended to be large.  
Since there were limits to precision, the main approach was to enlarge
the core itself to facilitate industrial production, and this tendency
became more pronounced as the share of electrical machines increased.  
In terms of sophisticated and complex circuits, ether-based machines
couldn't compete with easily mass-produced electrical ones. Because of
that, ether-based machines began to be used primarily for other
purposes, naturally focusing on areas where precision was not
required.  
  
For a time, there was an era when renowned ether engineers gathered, and
computational circuits using gigantic ether crystals surpassed
electrical ones as the pinnacle of computing. However, after electrical
ones surpassed them, this competition itself ceased, and now ether-based
computational circuits are considered antiques.  
But her existence defied this history of technological progress.  
  
"The more I hear, the more questions arise. Gatar-Gor—"  
"Gatan-goto. Professor."  
"Ah, yes... from what I've researched about Gatan-goto, it was far
beyond the technological standards of its time. Later imitations seem to
have emerged, but my research confirms that the ether efficiency of
their power sources was vastly inferior. While the manufacturing
precision, including metallurgy, has many crude and inefficient aspects
from a modern perspective, the ether-related technology is so advanced
it seems to have been brought from the distant future."  
  
Fundamentally, it seemed to deviate from currently accepted theories of
etherology.  
A product from an era where even gears were made by hand.  
Only the parts that Alberinea was involved with remained lost
technology, irreproducible even in this era of interstellar travel.  
  
There are geniuses in every era.  
But every genius simply guides humanity to the next step based on the
fundamental theories of their time.  
Alberinea's inventions—such as prosthetics and the construction of
railway networks—were still within the realm of understanding. But her
core and ether technology before his eyes were clearly different.  
  
"Could Alberinea have been an alien from an extrasolar civilization,
like the Minalshi?"  
"There is generally no difference from the biological species currently
referred to as Venua people, like yourself, Professor."  
  
Unit 3 tilted her head.  
  
"Would it be more convincing if they were aliens?"  
"No... I just thought it would be much easier to understand that way."  
  
Dogle sighed.  
  
"Humanity's technological level advanced dramatically after they landed
on Planet Venua. Their civilization, capable of interstellar travel
across the galaxy, was far more advanced than humanity at the time,
which could barely launch artificial satellites... let alone conduct
proper manned lunar exploration."  
  
Giants resembling reptiles, who suddenly arrived from space.  
They possessed long lifespans and high intelligence, and their
technology was far beyond humanity's.  
Their contact led this planet's civilization far forward.  
  
"If Alberinea was an engineer from such an advanced civilization, then
her numerous inventions, which seemed bizarre at the time, would make
sense... It's just a silly thought."  
  
The reason Dogle was so particular about ether technology was Their
existence.  
If he was going to research something, he wanted to approach it
differently from the fields they had already thoroughly explored.  
That was the fundamental idea, and his research into advanced ether
prosthetics began there.  
  
However, the fact that it was almost complete, and had already advanced
so far even 10,000 years ago, filled him with a sense of helplessness.  
Of course, the origin of ether prosthetics itself came from Alberinea.  
He had seen the magic crystals used in the joints of prosthetics, and
while they were incredibly precise, they had simple, textbook-like
engravings.  
He had been impressed, thinking it was astonishing if it was engraved in
ancient times, but that was all.  
Aside from the astonishing precision of the engraving itself, it was
merely the fundamental part of the currently used ether prosthetic
technology—the bare minimum.  
  
However, that was likely intentional.  
It was simply scaled down to match the technological level of the time;
to be usable with a simple structure so that many could understand it.  
Looking at the core, engraved by Alberinea, there was no doubt that she
could have easily created something that surpassed Dogle's developed
prosthetics if she wished.  
  
Dogle's prosthetics had led to the loss of his beloved wife and
daughter.  
But even that was merely treading a path someone else had already
walked.  
If it wasn't even a groundbreaking invention, but simply a reinvention
of the wheel, then what had his life been for—what had the deaths of his
wife and daughter been for?  
  
"...Professor?"  
"...No."  
  
He shook his head and picked up a photo frame.  
The image changed after a few seconds to a different one.  
All of them showed his wife and daughter.  
  
"I've always thought my research was meaningful. Of course, it began for
myself, just doing what I liked... but few people can continue something
just because it's fun. When you continue anything, it's not just fun;
there are also dead ends and hardships."  
  
He narrowed his eyes, tracing their faces with his finger.  
  
"So, I decided to think of this as research to make someone happy. ...If
I thought that, even when it was tough, even when I wanted to give up, I
could motivate myself by thinking that this was very important research.
That all the effort would amount to something."  
  
He exhaled deeply and put down the photo frame.  
  
"After that, I received many messages of joy, and I felt that all my
past hardships were rewarded. But there were also those who didn't like
my invention. ...Not content with mere harassment and slander, they took
the lives of my wife and daughter."  
  
How many times had he asked, "Why?"  
The questions in his heart were countless, and he couldn't find an
answer.  
  
"And yet, there were those who were saved by my research... I tried to
hold myself together by thinking that, but looking at you makes me
laugh."  
"…?"  
"My efforts were just unknowingly retracing someone else's footsteps.
What was my past for...? What have I lived for, I don't know. Why did my
wife and daughter have to die."  
  
He felt Unit 3 tilt her head curiously and gave a wry smile.  
  
"...Don't mind me. It's just grumbling and nonsense."  
"Yes, Professor."  
  
Her reply was devoid of emotion.  
Rather, her voice, devoid of emotional color, was strangely comforting
to Dogle.  
  
"May I ask a question?"  
"What is it?"  
"Do you wish to die, Professor?"  
  
Not understanding the meaning of her question, he turned to Unit 3.  
  
"Expressions similar to the Professor's have been recorded. They
generally tend to be observed in individuals who have lost organized
resistance during combat, become dispirited, and are in a state of
non-resistance. In some cases, they proceed to self-harming actions.
This is considered useful for combat efficiency and will be reported
during the next adjustment, but there are individual differences
depending on the situation and conditions, and many unknowns. If the
Professor is in a similar psychological state, I would very much like to
incorporate it as beneficial reference information and would appreciate
your explanation."  
  
This left him speechless.  
If he felt like dying, she wanted him to tell her about it.  
That's essentially what it meant.  
  
"You're... something else."  
"…?"  
  
He smiled wryly and shook his head at Unit 3, who tilted her head.  
  
"Yes. I want to die... yes, I feel like dying. You might not understand,
but... sometimes, humans have something more precious than their own
lives. When they lose that, they feel this way."  
  
He said, "This isn't right," after that.  
  
"Rather, it might be easier for you to understand. For example, you...
were created to kill enemies. Isn't that command something you should
protect more than your own life?"  
"Generally correct. If the command is to cease functioning, I will
comply."  
"It's the same. There's something that takes precedence over
self-preservation for humans too... For me, for example, it was my wife
and daughter. I felt that protecting them was my most important mission,
but... in the end, I couldn't fulfill it, and they died, while I alone
am still living like this."  
  
Dogle gazed at his own palm.  
  
"For some, it might be a dream, or a belief, or a friend... but it's all
the same. When people fail to fulfill an important mission they've
imposed on themselves, they become disappointed in themselves."  
"Disappointed?"  
"Perhaps I should say they lose their sense of self-worth."  
  
His palm now held no value.  
A hand that grasped only emptiness.  
  
"Inferring from the situation you described, they must have valued their
comrades who were killed before them more than their own lives. They
thought they had no value if they couldn't protect them, and chose to
commit suicide. Of course, I don't understand their feelings, but that's
what I gather from your story."  
"I do not understand why losing an object that should take precedence
over self-preservation leads to the loss of one's own value and
abandonment of life."  
"Well, if you look at it objectively, that may be true. It's not
rational."  
  
Dogle nodded.  
  
"But humans need something to live for. It doesn't matter if it's for
their own pleasure or anything else, but for me, it was making my wife
and daughter happy, and that was my purpose in life. ...Without that, I
don't even know what I'm living for. Even my only redeeming quality, my
research, was just tracing the path Alberinea had already trodden... I'm
just living because I haven't died, that's all I am."  
"I see, it is difficult to comprehend."  
  
Dogle laughed at Unit 3, who nodded expressionlessly.  
He found himself inexplicably laughing.  
Perhaps no emotional circuits were incorporated.  
In any case, her emotionless voice was refreshingly kind.  
  
"It would be much easier if I could think like you. But humans aren't
built that way. We're foolish, emotional, and even if we know what's
rational, we can't act that way."  
  
When he said that, Unit 3's eyes widened ever so slightly.  
  
"Is something wrong?"  
  
To his question, she thought for a moment and then spoke.  
  
"Based on my observations so far, I believe my Master was an
exceptionally skilled magician. Especially regarding the core function,
efficiency has been thoroughly pursued, possessing a flexible structure
designed for all types of exteriors. Currently, there are no existing
points for improvement in terms of functionality."  
"You're right. Even after all these years—no, I doubt humanity will ever
be able to create an artificial intelligence of the same level using
pure ether technology in the future."  
  
In just a brief moment, she adjusted and took control of the ether-based
synthetic body herself.  
The sheer incredibleness of this was something Dogle understood more
than anyone else.  
  
He had intended to take at least several days, and potentially several
months including fine-tuning, using the latest equipment in his
laboratory.  
The ancient ether crystal.  
Even from Dogle's perspective, there were many things he wasn't sure
about.  
  
The conditions were not just the same, but they should have been even
more challenging for her.  
A body crafted with technology from the far future.  
Yet, as if it were her own custom-made prosthetic, she took control
effortlessly.  
Just how many computational circuits were embedded within that tiny
core?  
  
He doubted whether anyone capable of reaching the same level would
emerge in the future.  
  
"Regarding the basic code of conduct, there are generally no questions.
It can be inferred that commands were simplified from the perspective of
operational convenience, and there are no critical problems concerning
that either."  
"...Are there any other problems?"  
"Yes. We, the Jaragasha, were created with the intention of efficiently
eliminating hostile individuals and groups. However, there is one
irrational rule that contradicts this, and it is our fatal
vulnerability."  
  
At her words, Dogle recalled a description he had found during his
research.  
Jaragasha, both then and in its final battle, was a ruthless, terrifying
combat machine, malevolent and powerful.  
But even such a seemingly flawless steel monster had one flaw.  
  
"Regardless of whether it is accidental or not, inflicting any harm upon
red-haired female individuals is strictly prohibited."  
  
Unit 3 tilted her head and asked.  
  
"This rule, which contradicts the manufacturing purpose of our Master
who created us so rationally, is my only question. ...Why did our Master
establish such a rule for us?"  
  
Carrying a question from the distant past.  
  
With an innocent face that conveyed profound wonder.  
  
"...Professor, do you know the reason?"  
  
His encounter with *her* was surely that moment.  
Dogle always thought so.
