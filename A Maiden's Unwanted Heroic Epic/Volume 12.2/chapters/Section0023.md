# Chapter 333 - Crescent Moon at Dawn 2

The next day, the ojou-sama from the Christand family visited the
training forest as usual.  
True to her dislike of horses, she had walked there, and her expression
lacked any enthusiasm.

When the captain smartly saluted, we followed suit, to which she gave a
perfunctory return salute.  
I thought she might at least praise our recent victory, but of course,
she didn't.

"Well then, shall we begin? It wouldn't bother Krische to do it all
together at once… Dagra, what do you think?"

"Yes. If possible, I would like to receive your guidance one squad at a
time. It would be easier for them to understand that way."

"Hmm, I see…"

Then, Krische-sama turned her gaze towards us, likely because I happened
to be closest. She beckoned me.

"Second squad, run! Everyone else, stand back a little."

Dagra gave his instructions, and in the slightly more open space, the
five of us faced Krische-sama.  
At that moment, I think I was still wondering if she was going to have
us do some basic sword practice.

"Dagra, wooden sword."

"Yes."

The captain immediately presented Krische-sama with his wooden sword in
both hands and stepped back.  
She skillfully twirled the wooden sword in one hand and said to me,

"Alright."

"…? Alright, what?"

"Koza! Answer like a soldier!"

"Y-yes! My apologies, Captain! What exactly do you mean by 'alright'?!"

Startled by the captain's voice, I questioned her again, and
Krische-sama tilted her head.  
She looked as if she was wondering what she was being asked, tracing her
lips with her finger as she pondered.

I was the one who should have been tilting my head. I never imagined
that we would be ordered to attack her five against one, such an absurd
command. We all exchanged glances.

"As I said yesterday, the Army Corps Commander will personally train you
from this point on.  
If you understand, draw your swords!"

"Y-yes…? Uh, five against one, is that right?"

"That's right. …My apologies, Commander. Is that acceptable?"

"Yes. Krische was being too brief. …So, any time is fine."

Even after hearing that, we were still very confused. We had heard about
it, but five against one, and the opponent was a child not even fifteen
years old. She had said various things yesterday, but five of us against
her felt a little excessive.

"You don't need to hold back on the five-on-one; come at me with the
intent to kill. Uh, even if Krische gets injured or dies, Krische swears
on Krische’s name Krische won't complain."

She nodded cheerfully as she said this, and we exchanged glances
again.  
The others in the squad looked to me questioningly, as if to ask, "What
do we do?", so I reluctantly drew the wooden sword at my waist and took
a stance.

"Injuring her is a bit too much."

I said that in a low voice, and they nodded in agreement.

"But I said you don't need to hold back…"

It should have been too far and too quiet for her to hear, but what kind
of ears did she have?  
Looking back later, it must have been lip-reading.  
Krische-sama had exceptionally sharp eyesight and could read words
simply from the movement of our lips.

"Well, fine. It's the first time, so let's get it over with quickly,
with a bit of explanation as well."

There was five meters between us.  
It wasn't that we couldn't see her.  
We saw the moment she lowered her stance, the moment she lunged.  
However, we only saw it.

It's difficult to explain that strange feeling.  
I understood that she was moving, and my mind registered that I had to
parry or I’d be in trouble.  
But my body didn’t feel any sense of danger at all; it didn’t even
flinch.

It was usually the opposite.  
If someone suddenly attacked, my body would move before my mind could
think, my body would instinctively create distance. Even someone not
used to fighting, a layman, would at least be startled if suddenly
threatened from the shadows.  
Whether they would faint or freeze up varied from person to person, but
their body would move before they could think.  
That’s how I thought humans were made.

And yet, I just stood there with my wooden sword, vaguely watching as it
was knocked away, until I was sent sprawling by a kick to my stomach. As
I groaned in pain and looked up, the four others in my squad were on
their knees, while only Krische-sama was standing.

"This is how strong Krische is, so it's fine. Next squad."

"Hey, the second squad is in the way. Move to the side."

Thus, still unable to recover from the pain and confusion, we were
dragged out of the circle.

Fortunately, thanks to our sacrifice, the next squad was allowed to
attack first, but their wooden sword didn't even graze her. Then, three
more squads failed to land a single blow and were defeated in turn, and
the faces of those watching with smirks finally turned grim.

Krische-sama’s movements left plenty of room for improvement.  
To an observer, it would only seem slightly fast, and while our squad
was the first, the others watching should have been able to react.  
Strangely, however, everyone was slow to react. They seemed dazed, their
swords deflected before they even realized they’d been attacked, or they
received a blow to the head, or were kicked to the ground. The squad
members, who had just achieved a resounding victory, were like training
scarecrows.

Even Kiriku, the second most skilled swordsman in the squad after
Kahlua, was treated like a child.  
The first squad, composed of the best fighters excluding Mia, the deputy
commander, was also easily defeated. In an instant, all forty were on
their knees before her, not even able to touch, let alone clash wooden
swords.

"It's fine to do it all together at once." Everyone finally understood
the meaning of those words. Even if everyone in the squad attacked her
one after another, defeating them would be easy. That was the intention
behind those words.

There were no more smiles; the air was frigid.

If this had been a real battlefield, the forty of us, including me,
would have been dead against Krische-sama alone. And she could surely
have killed everyone here if she wanted to.  
If five of us couldn't even react, it wouldn't make a difference if
there were dozens of us.

Everyone had heard and laughed at the absurd rumors: that she had cut
down hundreds of people with a simple self-defense curved sword, that
even seasoned veterans couldn't match her monstrous strength. It might
be believable if the rumored person was a powerfully built man, but for
a child barely five feet tall, it was simply outrageous. Even if the
sycophants around her started the rumors to curry favor with the
Christand family ojou-sama, they had exaggerated far too much, making it
ridiculous, and we laughed at it.

Regardless of the exaggeration, it was still a rumor. We thought she was
at least not weak, but her appearance differed from my image of a
formidable warrior; I thought I might lose to her in a one-on-one match.

But reality was chillingly cold.  
Who could imagine that the child who cheerfully ate cookies was actually
a monster who could slaughter a hundred people without breaking a sweat?
If this were a battlefield, all our heads would have been cut off before
we even realized what was happening.

For Krische-sama, battle wasn't a contest but a task. The number or
strength of the opponent only determined whether it would be more or
less troublesome. With her unreasonable skill, she forcibly and silently
subjugated her opponents and finished them off.

That's what “unimaginable” means.  
I can imagine a powerfully built man like the Army Corps Commander,
Argrand, cutting down a hundred people, but I can’t imagine a girl like
Krische-sama cutting down a hundred people.  
If you can’t imagine it, you can’t understand it, and if you can’t
understand it, you can’t deal with it.  
Therefore, there was no other way but to be killed without even
understanding why.

The reason why the Black Century—and later, the Black Flag Special
Unit—became known as the world's strongest private army is precisely
because of that. Whether or not you know that there are people like
Krische-sama in the world who are beyond imagination. That's probably
the biggest difference.

Individually, we weren't particularly outstanding. Kahlua was a genius,
while the rest of us were just reasonably capable magic users. Even so,
it was more than enough for ordinary people, something to be proud of.  
However, Krische-sama’s existence prevented us from being overconfident
on the battlefield.

Against strong opponents, we always attacked in numbers. We never fought
a fifty-fifty or an eighty-twenty battle; we never gambled.  
If necessary, we'd use eye gouging, throwing stones, grappling—we'd do
anything to win, indiscriminately. We would overwhelm them using a local
numerical advantage, preventing them from even moving a hand or foot.

It didn't matter whether the opponent seemed strong or weak. We never
let down our guard and only utilized the advantage of numbers.

The battlefield was an unreasonable world. If your luck was bad, you
would encounter Krische Christand on the battlefield. If you didn’t
impose unfairness before it was imposed on you, you would die.

Fortunately, we escaped the "worst unfairness," but afterward, we saw
many monsters who wielded unfairness alone, including the strong-armed
Nakirus and the Black Lion Gildanstein.  
I believe that seeing someone who was the epitome of unfairness during
training made us stronger.

Even a fourteen-year-old could kill all of us.  
At the time, I thought there must be even more incredible monsters in
the world, and because of that, our seriousness in training increased.

Of course, there aren’t two people in the world like Krische-sama, it
was just overthinking—but if you asked me when the Black Century was
born, it was probably that day.

By the time the forest training ended, our awareness had clearly
changed.  
While most of us didn't harbor any affection for Krische-sama, knowing
that she was an undeniable genius made us somewhat more understanding of
her previous attitude.  
Thinking that she wasn't a terrible noble lady who looked down on
commoners, but rather a genius girl who just couldn't understand
ordinary people, eased some of our anger.  
We thought that was just how geniuses were, and we just accepted it.

Her overflowing “genius-like” qualities were also a reason. She didn't
care at all how others perceived her, living freely as she pleased. She
was like a child towards Selena-sama and Berry-sama, and we had seen her
act spoiled countless times. In a good way and a bad way, she wasn’t a
soldier or a noble.

The same was true for her treatment of us.

"…Beltz. Why are we being made to practice cooking?"

"I don't know. But since we were told to, we have to do it."

We returned to the fort from the forest for another inspection.  
We thought we’d be able to show her how much we had changed and grown
since then.

That day's training was about camping, and it was lunchtime. We were
setting up tents and preparing our own meals when Krische-sama arrived
and took a sip of the soup, exploding into rage.

'Bald Eagle, what is this?'

'Y-yes, that…is there a problem—'

'A huge one! I don't feel any passion to make a delicious meal, any care
at all, from this soup. Will this meal raise the morale of the
soldiers?'

'No, I don't think it will raise morale! Commander.'

'You must have had many opportunities to camp before, so why haven't you
tried to improve? Krische thought Bald Eagle was quite a good centurion,
but Krische is disappointed. Even in enemy territory, let alone now,
where we are safe and have plenty of time, this soup is an insult to the
ingredients. What were you thinking—'

The captain, who had apparently become known as "Bald Eagle," lectured
us. Krische-sama generally seemed to respect the captain; although she
would point out things or comment on policies, she never directly
contradicted him.  
But this time, she must have been extremely displeased, as she was
angrier than ever before.

Dagra apologized repeatedly, bowing deeply.

'Uh, I’m sorry. Today's cooking was assigned to our squad and the
eleventh squad…'

Kahlua, seeing how things were going, spoke to Mia, and offering the
first squad (who were in charge of cooking that day) as a sacrifice
appeased Krische-sama. It seemed that she was finally convinced that it
was understandable if the meal was bad because Mia was simply a bad
cook.

She nodded, saying that it was unavoidable if they did their best but
failed. However, that was that, and Krische-sama promptly halted the
training and ordered cooking lessons.

"Mia, what is the deputy commander of the squad doing? It's the same as
deciding which soldiers to move and in what order. Even with soup, you
need to think about the order in which you add the ingredients depending
on what they are. Why throw everything in at once?"

"I-I'm sorry…"

"It's fine if you're clumsy; the important thing is to have the
intention to do it carefully. Berry said that if you earnestly try to
make it delicious, your feelings will be conveyed. Krische thinks so
too. When it comes to cooking, you should properly consider the person
who will eat it—"

We listened to the cooking lesson in the background with mixed
feelings.  
Because of what had happened before, everyone was probably fired up and
motivated, but this was a letdown. The men making ten servings of soup,
divided into two groups—we all felt the same about what we were doing at
the training grounds. The soldiers nearby, who had been made to march
and run, cast glances at us, seemingly asking, "What are these guys
doing?".  
We were more eager than anyone to hear the answer.

As Beltz was about to put the cut ingredients into the pot, he stopped
with his hand.

"Put it aside for now. If we don’t do it seriously, we’ll get scolded."

"You seem pretty used to it. Were you doing something before?"

"My family was in the food business. I ran away because I hated it."

"Oh, that's unexpected. You don't look like you fit with a knife,
though."

"Well, after that, I lived a life similar to yours, but for longer."

Beltz laughed, took some soup with a ladle, and tasted it.

"I never thought I'd need this, but I'm thankful to my father for once.
It doesn't look like anyone here is good at cooking. If things go well,
we might win first place."

He spoke with confidence. As he said, he was working efficiently, and
his knife skills were excellent. Three groups grilled the meat for the
soup, and the browning was perfect.

First place would mean exemption from tomorrow's training, with the
exception of instructing the last-place squad on cooking. We had our
thoughts on this situation, but it wasn't bad if it turned out this way.

"That would be great. I'm counting on you—,"

"What about this one? It looks pretty good."

Krische-sama appeared silently from behind. Despite looking like nothing
more than presence itself, not having a presence when standing behind
someone was strange.  
She must have been unaware of it, but it was bad for the heart.

"Y-yes, it's turning out to be quite a good soup."

Beltz said that as he put some soup on a small plate and handed it to
her.  
Krische-sama gazed intently at the small plate, closed her eyes and
sniffed it.

There was a silent moment, a simple taste test.  
It shouldn’t have been a big deal, but she was looking more serious than
ever before.  
We were strangely nervous and looked at each other.

Krische-sama slowly brought the plate to her lips, another pause. Like
an antique dealer examining a work of art, the way she acted...Beltz was
seen swallowing his saliva.

After slowly opening her eyes, Krische-sama glanced at the ingredients
waiting to be added on the cutting board and asked,

"Why are the chorus leaves left whole?"

"B-because it's better to add them right before finishing, to prevent
the aroma from…escaping…"

Beltz's somewhat stiff words caused the silver-haired girl to furrow her
brow slightly, before nodding quietly.

"The ingredients are coarsely chopped, and the inadequate pre-processing
leaves a lingering unpleasantness," she stated.

"Y-yes... I apologize..." Beltz stammered.

"However, at the same time, the skillful use of heat and the order of
ingredient addition are not bad.  
For whom did you make this soup?"

"F-for the Commander... I thought a lighter flavor would be preferable,"
Beltz replied.

"I see. Krische intended for this to be made for soldiers fatigued from
training, but Krische’s explanation might have been poor. However, the
consideration shown for the person who will eat it is highly
commendable."

With the air of a craftsman, she clasped her arms and declared, "Beltz,
you will instruct Mia's team in cooking tomorrow.  
Bald Eagle!"

The captain, thus summoned, rushed forward and straightened his posture.

"Beltz will be the temporary cooking instructor. From now on, whenever
troop meals are prepared, Beltz will taste-test them and provide
guidance as needed."

"Yes, understood," Bald Eagle replied.

"Koza, learn from Beltz's work and observe him closely. The same applies
to the other team members."

After saying this, Krische turned back to Beltz, who hastily
straightened his posture.

"As I said, it's not a particularly wonderful dish," Krische commented.

"...!" Beltz was speechless.

"However, it's a passable troop meal. Krische highly values the
dedication and consideration shown in this soup, which takes into
account the person who will eat it. Do not become complacent, continue
to strive for improvement, and do not forget to be creative. You will
surely be able to aim even higher."

"—It was a delicious soup," she continued.  
Beltz's eyes widened at these words.

"Y-yes! Thank you very much!"

He responded with a joyful salute. Krische nodded again and turned away.

"Bald Eagle, I'm returning to the fortress," she said.

"Yes! Thank you for your guidance."

"No need for thanks. This is also part of my work... then," she added,
and trotted off towards the fortress, watched by everyone.

A vaguely awkward atmosphere hung in the air in front of the
half-finished pot.

"Finish the soup first. We'll eat it tonight. Beltz, you're directly
appointed by the Commander; from now on, you'll be in charge of
taste-testing the troop meals. Be prepared for surprise inspections and
teach these guys the basics of cooking whenever necessary."

"Yes, understood, Captain," Beltz replied.

"...Continue working."

Everyone felt a strange mix of emotions, but perhaps the captain felt it
most acutely.  
He had stressed to us the importance of being prepared for
Krische-sama's inspection after returning from the forest, only for it
to turn into a complete cooking lesson.  
He had likely been more determined than anyone to show the improved
discipline and unity of the team compared to before—a melancholy air
hung about his retreating figure.  
He was arguably the biggest victim.  
It was truly unfortunate.

"Well... anyway, it's good, Beltz—?"

I said, and Beltz stared intently at the soup, a faraway look in his
eyes, as if recalling something from the past.

"What's wrong?"

"No... I was just remembering things from the past."

"The past...?"

I ladled some soup into a small bowl and tasted it.

"My father was a picky eater. From the first time I cooked, he never
once said it was delicious...  
...And so I came to hate cooking—."

He closed his eyes and nodded.

"—But, just being told that the soup I made after all this time was
delicious... it's stupid, but I'm a little happy. It wasn't that I hated
cooking itself, you see."

"I see... well, that's good."

Unable to say anything to Beltz, who was lost in thought, I simply
patted him on the shoulder.

The origin of the world's strongest private army was the day
Krische-sama was shown with a sword, but the origin of my cooking
business with Beltz was undoubtedly that single word, "delicious."  
Showing the sword was merely instruction; the word "delicious" was
merely an honest reaction to tasting the soup.  
For Krische, it was probably just something she thought of and did,
something she said without much thought. But that's usually not the case
for others.

Krische's unfairness wasn't limited to swords.  
Her very existence was probably made of the word "unfairness."  
With a single, casual action or word, she could easily break, shatter,
or change someone's life—without a care in the world, completely
unaware, munching on cookies with a carefree expression.

Krische Christand; that's what I sometimes think of her.  
The ultimate natural disaster.
