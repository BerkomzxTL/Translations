# Chapter 348 - Charm 7

The sisters' bond was a little too deep.  
Bogan, though vaguely aware of it, understood to a certain extent. He
knew he had essentially taken the sister the younger one depended on.  
Still, he showed considerable concern and often spoke to the younger
sister.

He knew Berry sometimes watched him train.  
That was likely why he suggested she try exercising.  
Berry, accepting his suggestion, expressed a desire to learn
self-defense techniques, and started training occasionally during her
free time.

That day, after training, Berry returned to her room and handed Bogan a
towel.

"Your progress is astounding," he said quietly, causing Lazura to
chuckle wryly.

"That child is a genius at everything she does."

"Of course, her talent itself is amazing…but her eyes are different.  
They're the eyes of someone with a purpose."

"A purpose?"

"She's training with a goal in mind. She's calm. Did it look like she
was being one-sidedly attacked?"

"…? Yes."

Berry trained in her spare time.  
Lazura, naturally, also watched their training whenever she had free
time.  
The result was always the same.  
No matter how talented she was, victory against Bogan, known for his
swordsmanship, was impossible overnight.

Bogan, seeing Lazura tilt her head in confusion, continued with a
serious expression.

"Today, I deliberately used a rough sword style to try to make her
frustrated."

"Deliberately?"

"Sometimes, anger is necessary. Strong emotions naturally flow
outward…and she needs that, because she keeps them inside.  
I thought she'd get a little riled up at her age…but not a ripple.  
That's what it is."

The results were always the same, and Berry remained her usual calm
self. She effortlessly learned and mastered techniques to subdue an
opponent unarmed, and even though she initially showed a little surprise
at the sword thrust at her during sword training, she remained calm
afterwards.  
She wasn't the type to struggle uselessly, and if she realized it was
futile, she wouldn't resist.  
Today's training was no different.

She understood that there were different ways to use a sword—a graceful
sword and a rough sword—and she noticed Bogan swinging his sword more
roughly than usual. He deliberately knocked her sword out of her hand.

Before, their training was quiet; they never directly clashed swords.
Considering the power of their swords, a direct hit could easily injure
or break a wrist, and if a sword broke, it could cause serious injuries,
so they avoided that. Until now, the only sound was the wind slicing
through the air as they moved. So, when Bogan knocked Berry's sword to
the ground three times at the start, she was a little worried. But Berry
said she was fine, and she didn't seem to have hurt her hand.  
Knowing she wouldn't push herself, Bogan continued.

If he said he knocked her sword away to frustrate her, it made some
sense. It was just an assumption, but getting your sword repeatedly
knocked away is probably more frustrating than just having a sword
pointed at you. If Lazura were on the receiving end, she'd be annoyed
after the first time.

"If she sees a sword she can't parry, she immediately gives up and
focuses on observation. She observes my movements, my magic…but she
doesn't show any sign of trying to overcome me."

"That's…"

"Some people say training should be like real combat, and there's some
truth to that. But there aren't many people who can take training so
seriously, eliminating their emotions and just learning. Even I still
get riled up when I spar with Nozan or Kolkis.  
Only someone who keeps something deeply hidden in their heart would be
so calm."

Bogan mentioned remembering the Captain.

"She doesn't shame herself by losing in training; she greedily uses it
to improve. In sword combat, nobody can learn 10 out of 10 things.
Emotions get in the way, habits appear, you're controlled by your own
body, and you can only learn one or two things at best…maybe three or
four even with talent.  
But she calmly tries to learn as close to 10 as possible…It's not
normal."

He continued, gazing at the sword in his hand.

"The Captain was a true soldier. A sword is merely a means to
victory…Commander Faren is like that, too. They hone their skills as a
means, but they never mistake the means for the goal. However, it's an
awfully harsh way to learn for an eleven-year-old who doesn't even know
war.  
There's no joy in improvement, no anger at her shortcomings—she just
learns."

"The goal…"

"It's easy to guess."

Lazura nodded quietly. To live peacefully, to have happiness, there's no
need to wield a sword.

"She's always been like that, so I didn't realize it."

"Is that so?"

"Yes. She immerses herself until she succeeds, no matter what."

Meaningful or meaningless.

She sighed deeply. If Berry pointed the tip of her sword at someone, it
would be only one person.

"What should I say?"

"She's a clever child. She won't rashly think about anything right now.
No matter what her goal is, turning her attention outward isn't a bad
thing for her. And with that talent…the more options, the better."

Lazura glared at Bogan at those words, and he chuckled wryly.

"It's an adult's responsibility to nurture a child's talents; it's just
a common saying. It's too wasteful to let such talent sleep as a mere
servant."

"Please don't try to get her into the military. Of course, if she
herself says so, I'll consider it."

"I'll be careful."

Lazura let out a breath, watching Bogan laugh.

"She's my pride and joy.  
She could become a truly remarkable and accomplished soldier. But I
don't think she should be put in a world of superiority and
inferiority."

"Hmm."

"For a child who can get results so easily, the process is more
important. If she's put in a world where results are everything, she'll
do anything without a second thought."

She leaned against the wall and looked up at the high sun.  
The world bathed in the glorious sunlight.  
Bogan often says he doesn't like war, but in his eyes, perhaps even the
gruesome battlefield is connected to this, glorious.  
As a sacred place worthy of honorable warriors risking their lives.

"For example, shooting down the last remaining great warrior of Elsren
with an arrow."

"I see, it's quite a difficult problem."

"War is also a human activity. You acknowledge that side of it too, so
even in a world where results are everything, you value the process,
don't you? I really like that contradiction in you."

He is a soldier and a warrior.  
That contradictory value system is incredibly beautiful.  
Even in such a cruel world, he wields his sword while maintaining his
human dignity, achieving victory—Bogan is the ideal warrior and hero.  
That's why Lazura accepts the stories of the battlefield he tells. It's
a cruel world, yet brilliantly beautiful.  
Like a boy whose eyes shine at heroic tales, Bogan still has such a
heart.

"But I want her to be able to worry about various things.  
For her, worrying about trivial things like what to make for dinner
tonight, as a mere servant, is far more important. …Even though she
makes everything delicious."

She chuckled, her shoulders shaking, picturing Berry worrying over the
menu. If you told her, "As my sister, you should know what your nee-san
wants to eat," she would worry even more and look troubled.  
Berry's home-cooked meals, made with all her heart, are always what
Lazura wants to eat. But she would never tell her that.

"I understand what you mean…process and results, it's difficult. As a
soldier, I still think good results are enough.  
Not being able to do that is proof of my immaturity as a soldier."

"Maybe, but…even if you are or aren't a soldier, we are in a great
process, wouldn't you say?"

She put her hand on Bogan's cheek and laughed.

"It's after life that your way of living is born. Whether you travel a
harsh path or wait for dusk by a great tree, it's just a way of life."

She stretched up and kissed him lightly.

"If we let the day end without realizing it, that's a sad life."

Bogan chuckled and gently stroked Lazura's head.

"You're like a teacher sometimes."

"Oh, do you dislike my lectures?"

"I was originally a child who liked playing outside. I still get scolded
by Teacher Faren… I don't mind training my subordinates, but considering
my position, which do you think is more important, the sword or
learning?"

Bogan imitated his voice, causing Lazura to chuckle and take his arm.  
A thin, bony face.  
The imposing, older commander.  
He was Bogan’s superior for a time, and Lazura had seen him scolding him
several times.

"As a child, I ran away from studying and wielded a sword…as if I was
saying that studying was useless for my future, but I was cornered even
after running away, and couldn't escape anymore. The child who pretended
to be a teacher is now in the opposite position…I regret my lack of
education."

"Well, well.  
Then you'll have to work hard from now on.  
For our children, we'll be a father figure they can ask anything and
learn from...I'm sure they'll ask you many things with bright, admiring
eyes."

"If I become a teacher to my own child, I'll be in despair. I'll do my
best."

"Yes," she said, nodding with a laugh.

Their married life was simply happy. They struggled with their inability
to have children, but they often heard that it was difficult for nobles
to have children.  
Three or four children from one wife was rare, and the Argan family was
not a prolific one.  
They knew this, but it was still a little unsettling when it came to
them.

They had used medication for contraception, so they decided to consult a
doctor early on.  
Even so, after a year, they conceived a child, only to lose it shortly
after.  
When Lazura apologized, he laughed and said it was alright.  
They had been discussing names, eagerly planning for their future.  
Bogan’s efforts to shield her from sadness, to force a smile, his
strength and gentleness—sometimes it was painful.  
And strong light often casts deep shadows.

A round moon hung in the sky.  
A gentle light coloring the night.  
With a blanket around her shoulders, she rested her hands on the
railing, gazing listlessly at the night wind.

"You'll catch a cold."

"I have a sister who won't let me catch a cold."

Without looking back, she reached out, receiving a warm, wood-carved
cup.  
The heated milk steamed white.

"It's beautiful."

"Yes. I want to be like that."

Sipping the milk, she said to her sister standing beside her.

"Shining beautifully at night, melting into the sky in the morning.
Without ever dimming, always beautiful."

"You're already like that, nee-san. More like the sun, perhaps."

"The sun doesn't dim."

"It does get covered by clouds. And night is also a kind of shadow of
the earth."

"Don't be so clever."

Her sister chuckled.  
Dimming the bright world, shining gently in the dark world.

Bogan’s world was very beautiful and bright, yet sometimes her own
shadow seemed to grow large.  
At such times, her sister was always by her side.

Just being there, silently, looking at the sky together, drinking warm
milk.  
That was enough.  
Seeing her trace her lips with her fingertip, her concern was painfully
evident, washing away even the tragic feeling she'd been caught in.

Losing the child was sad.  
There would be more such things in the future, sad things will
undoubtedly happen.  
But in the same way—or even more so than herself—someone would grieve
and worry.  
Lazura was fortunate.  
What she should do was not to spend her days crying, but to cherish such
a person.

"If it's a girl, let's name her Selene."

"Selene?"

"Yes. Not as dazzling as the sun, a child who gently illuminates the
night. A wonderful girl who, even if she waxes and wanes, can still
shine on her own."

The moon goddess with three faces.  
Or three sisters.  
Waxing and waning, again and again.  
The most radiant form of the moon is Sha-Selene.  
The goddess of beauty, illuminating and guiding the night, the protector
of travelers.  
One who proudly moves forward.

"It's a somewhat commonplace name."

"No. It's a beautiful name…it's quite rare, and I don't think there have
been any with this name in the royal family for generations."

"That's right.  
Then it's settled…if it's a girl, she'll be Selene."

Lazura was someone who couldn't stand on her own.  
She leaned on her sister, a weak person who could only stand like
that.  
Bogan felt that Berry depended on Lazura, but it wasn't actually true.  
Lazura also probably depended on her sister just as much.

The world wasn't as beautiful as she had imagined as a child.  
It wasn't just bright, it had many dark parts, and Lazura was a weak
person who, for example, turned away from such realities.  
The sisters were like the two sides of a coin.  
If one side showed tails, the other would shine as heads, the two being
one.  
The sister who usually troubled Lazura, on nights like this, worried and
supported her sister.

She couldn't imagine a life without her sister; it was half of her
being.  
You could call it love, but it certainly wasn't a healthy
relationship.  
If you could stand on your own two feet, then it's about mutual support
and help. Their sisterly bond was something deeper than mere dependence.

They stood leaning on each other, which can't be called independence.  
It could be described as the happiest, and also the most distorted.

"I really wish I had a younger brother or sister, like I have you. But
Bogan doesn't seem to want another wife, and it seems very difficult for
me to have a second child.  
I want a healthy, energetic child like that. A child who can become
strong after knowing weakness."

"A child of you and the head of the family will be fine.  
They will certainly be very healthy."

"I think I'm the most beautiful, stunning, and flawless older sister in
the world, but you overestimate me sometimes."

"Even though you say so, I don't think it's an overestimation…"

"Silly girl," Lazura laughed.

"Just as your nee-san. Besides being beautiful, I'm just like you. I'm
not particularly wonderful or strong. I fall into meaningless sadness
and wait for my sister to comfort me."

She said this, embracing Berry from behind.  
Day by day, her sister grew softer and more beautiful.  
Her sister's hand gently stroked Lazura's cheek.

"So, will you sleep with me tonight?"

"Yes, Sister."

After they finished their milk, they went to bed.  
Berry naturally nestled into Lazura's chest, pulling her head closer.  
It was the opposite of usual, with Lazura resting her cheek on Berry's
head.

"I'm going to stop crying today. It's pathetic and shameful."

"Yes."

"The child to come will be a very energetic child. A slightly silly
child who's the healthiest in the world, running around the house and
abandoning their studies for play, just the right amount."

"Yes," Berry said, gently stroking Lazura's head.

"Let's laugh a lot and cry a lot, an energetic child like that…Next
time, I'll have a child like that."

"Yes."

"So, for now, pretend you didn't see anything.  
Forget about this tomorrow. This is an order from your nee-san.  
Understood?"

"Yes…I swear on this name."

Saying that, she hugged her head tightly.  
She pressed her face against her slightly swollen chest, and let out a
sob, her tears soaking her.  
She cried until her frustration and sadness withered away, and her
sister's hand simply stroked her head.  
The night enveloped them both.  
The next morning, it was as if nothing had happened, business as
usual.  
The tears were in her sister's heart.

She showed a smile to Bogan when he returned from work, saying, "Let's
do our best again." Bogan smiled, relieved, saying, "You're a truly
strong woman."  
Lazura also felt relieved, thinking this was her true self.

She was selfish and sly, changing her reliance from person to person,
always wearing a smile, a bad woman.  
But both of them indulged her, so it was only natural.

A year and a little more later, they named the baby Selene.  
Lazura, who fell a little ill after childbirth, was hardly noticed; the
child was unusually energetic and noisy.  
Just as she wished, she was moderately silly and cute.

She must have been just such a baby herself.

She kissed her forehead, whispering a charm to prevent her from taking
on her bad traits.  
But she wished that she would grow up healthy, even if she did inherit
them.  
Such was her magic spell.

The small baby laughed foolishly at the kiss.
