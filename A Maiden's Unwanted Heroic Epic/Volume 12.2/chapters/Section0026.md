# Chapter 336 - Crescent Moon at Dawn 5

The end of the civil war was a brutal fight for us.  
We learned of Krische-sama's strength, recognized our own weakness, and
survived a crazy battle like the one at Bernaich, forging an unbreakable
bond.

Even so, many died.

Before our reorganization into the Black Flag Special Unit, we were
undoubtedly the best Century that day. Even with our captain absent, our
morale was at its peak.  
Entrusted with protecting General Selene, we were prepared to fight to
the death.  
Even though, just a short time ago, we didn't know the first thing about
coordinated attacks, after fighting on the front lines through three
battles with Marcellus, Hilkintos, and Villing, I can swear, no matter
what anyone says, that on that day we possessed the best unity and
courage.

But it's because even such a group can be crushed by force that a
monster is called a monster.

In the battles before, we surrounded and killed many magic users.  
Of course, there were plenty who would have been impossible to beat in a
one-on-one fight. But if one person wasn't enough, we'd use two, or
three, or four, mercilessly stabbing them from behind – that was the
Black Century. If necessary, we’d throw sand, hurl weapons – whatever it
took to kill them mercilessly.

Only the strong can call that cowardly. We knew painfully well that we
were the weak, the commoners of the battlefield, and that if we
survived, a victory was a victory – the dead have no right to complain.
That fighting style was established, and we didn't need eye contact for
coordination. Our common understanding was that a group could always
defeat any strong warrior.

But it was only one person.  
Even with a commitment to stake our lives, even resorting to dirty
tactics, and taking advantage of our superior numbers… still, we
couldn't kill just one person.

The giant wielding twin axes, whose name was Nakirus Felizar, scattered
the guts of those who stood before him with a single swing.

Every single one of them thought they were the best of the best.  
They weren’t inferior to heroes in fairy tales. They were the coolest
guys in the world. Only fools who could throw away their one life for
their comrades, driven by the moment and momentum.

Some said they'd tell their kids, "Papa was a hero,"  
others wanted to propose to the woman at their favorite bar, some just
wanted to drink as much as they could.  
They were silly dreams, laughable when you hear them. But for them,
those dreams were better than any grand cause.

But that monster scattered all of that.

The world isn't equal. Bound dreams, brilliance—all can be shattered by
the will of a single person.

And even that monster was easily crushed by Krische-sama.

We were relieved, but I wondered what we were. If Krische-sama hadn’t
arrived, Mia would have died, and we might have been completely wiped
out.  
Logically, I know we bought time, but emotionally, it didn't feel that
way.

The feeling of picking up the corpses after the battle… only those who
experienced it would understand.

The grotesque organs and limbs… strangely, I didn’t feel nauseous. I
sometimes cursed them, saying, "If you’re going to die, die a little
cleaner!" and laughed.

“….Hey, that’s my hand,”

Even a guy like Daz, who barely escaped death, laughed the same way. We
had to laugh.

So, at night, we drank.  
Not in a somber way, but boisterously, laughing loudly.

We weren’t that important to begin with.  
People like me, day laborers, failed artisans, farmers, sheep herders…
the kind of people you find everywhere, the kind you’d hit if you threw
a stone. Even if we learned a few skills, the fact remained.

Once you accept that, you go back to normal. The world is moved by a
handful of people, and we aren't those people. We should have known
that.  
Ephemeral lives, like insects in the eyes of the world. It’s enough to
live fleetingly, indulging in pleasure, eating, drinking, and laughing.

That’s how we greeted Krische-sama at the feast. We’re like insects, but
Krische-sama isn’t. She cut the monster Felizar in two, and instantly
decapitated the King's brother, who Kahlua and the others couldn't even
touch.

Our figures will be depicted in the background of a painting of that
princess. Warriors who served a peerless great hero.  
More than enough, even with change to spare for mere insects like us.

Since it’s a depiction of a scene from the victory, it’s more realistic
if we’re making a lot of noise. We praised Krische-sama's insane
exploits.  
"If we follow you, there's nothing to fear," we thought.

But unfortunately, our princess had many flaws.

“Krische only helped a little at the end. In that place, in that
situation—even without Krische, the situation was advantageous, thanks
to this unit’s performance.  
They did a great job following Krische’s order to protect Selene.”

The airhead princess said such words.

“….It’s a shame that we can’t tell the people who died. Because they
were insubordinate soldiers who disobeyed Krische’s orders, I wanted to
praise or scold them…how silly.”

After killing people like insects, she lowered her eyes like that. She
wasn’t laughing happily, but she was probably thinking of those missing
faces.

She threw cold water on our excitement, and left with Kahlua. The feast
continued, but one by one, people disappeared.

Once the people are gone, the feast ends. I returned to my bed in the
tent and closed my eyes. I could hear pathetic sniffling. Grown men
being so pathetic… it's beyond belief.  
I wanted to drag out whichever idiot was crying, but I ignored the
sounds and turned my back.

A princess who calmly tramples on others, a mass of injustice.  
She probably doesn't think about the feelings of those being killed.
Compared to her, the monster Felizar was more decent. He probably had
his beliefs, and the fight with us insignificant insects was the result
of a clash of those beliefs. Even as an enemy, he was a formidable guy,
worthy of respect.  
We had honor, beliefs, pride… we fought holding onto those things, so
it's understandable.

We all fought desperately for something unyielding. It wasn't just a
massacre, but a noble exchange of lives. None of those who died there
regretted it. There couldn't have been a better place to die.

But without knowing or understanding the thoughts and struggles of these
underlings, she casually kills them, like she’s kicking aside pebbles on
the road.

She says, “…it’s a shame they died,”

A typical phrase, said without understanding the atmosphere. She doesn’t
even care about why no one says such words.

Like commenting on a neighbor’s unfortunate accident.  
“They were so energetic yesterday…”

Our princess, Krische Christand, lacks empathy.

The Black Century became the Black Flag Special Unit.  
Except for the close call of nearly becoming a mysterious unit called
the “Kurofuyu Unit”, there's not much else to say about what happened
after.

A girl’s unwilling heroic epic that lasted until dawn.  
We just ran under the moon.

Of course, if I think about the details, it never ends. We have no
shortage of funny stories and silly talk, but that’s the end of the bad
memories.  
Krische-sama is unreasonable, lacking any charm, but she doesn’t repeat
the same mistakes.

That era, in a word, was a stage for Krische-sama. It must have been
unbearable for the others.  
The enemies who stood in her way were villains meant to be defeated, and
because of the cheesy, ridiculous script, even strong warriors were cut
down and exited. Krische-sama was stronger and wiser than anyone else,
an invincible hero.  
Moreover, as a lead actress, she was third-rate, and she didn’t care
about entertaining the audience.  
She quickly subdued everyone who opposed her, and happily retreated to
the backstage for her behind-the-scenes work.

If I were an audience member, I’d have complained, but my role was a
soldier.  
My job was to keep the temper of the great actress who loved the
backstage. I thought every day, "I wish this ridiculous play would
end,". If it did, no one would complain even if the lead actress stayed
backstage for life.  
I wouldn’t have to go on a stage I didn't want to, and I wouldn't be
called the lead again.

Krische-sama had no interest in status, honor, or power.  
As the Queen’s elder sister, Alberinea, she had a privileged position,
where she could have anything she wanted just by asking, but she loved
pretending to be a servant in an apron dress.  
She’s cold-blooded and heartless, yet she says things like, "Working for
someone is wonderful,” which is the epitome of hypocrisy.

Or maybe, because she couldn't feel it, she wanted to be that way.

She was called a cursed child of the royal family, but in reality,
Krische-sama was insane.  
Otherwise, she couldn't have killed people so mercilessly.  
Krische-sama was fundamentally crazy – and I understood, through our
long association, that she hated herself for it.

She really doesn't care about social values.  
Whether it's peace or not, whether a child is being cut down in front of
her, or whether someone's guts are being torn out… she watches calmly,
with a cookie in her mouth. She doesn't feel pity or sympathy, and she
can't.  
She just understands what she sees—a child being cut down, guts torn
out—and nothing more.

But once a relationship forms, she's surprisingly kind.  
She makes prosthetics for the unit members, making up reasons as she
goes, and even if Kahlua says or does something rude, she'll only get
childishly angry.  
The magical weapons, at their root, were probably made to prevent more
casualties among us.

And it’s even more so with people who aren't her subordinates.  
No matter what happens, she's always polite, bowing repeatedly. In such
relationships, her kindness is unsettling, yet outside those
relationships, she instantly renders everything worthless.

I sometimes think Krische-sama’s biggest reason for longing to be a
servant was to avoid showing that side of herself. A small world,
entirely within her sphere of influence, completely isolated from the
outside.  
In such a place, Krische-sama could remain kind, and no one would think
she’s crazy.

The great feat of unifying the world was probably for that reason alone.
Not because she loved peace, but because she needed peace to hide her
madness. To that end, she simply annihilated all her enemies. Some will
deny it, but it’s easier for me to understand it that way.

“….Berry said so too.”

That’s Krische-sama's well-known catchphrase.  
Berry-sama, mentioned frequently, is her servant. As expected of the
Christand family, she was extremely beautiful, but I don't have many
memories of seeing her.  
She visited Krische-sama several times, but Krische-sama never brought
her in front of us.  
The Queen was more accessible.  
When she brought a servant, it was always Kahlua’s sister, Elvena, not
Berry-sama.

Her grandfather, Gallen-sama, the Marshal’s assistant Faren, and her
servant, Berry-sama.  
Krische-sama wholeheartedly praised only these three people in the
world, but especially when Berry-sama appeared, the atmosphere between
the two was a world of their own.  
They would completely abandon their conversations and training, focusing
only on each other, as evident in their behavior at the mansion.

But why doesn't she bring her with her?  
When I think about it, the only reason that makes sense is that she
doesn't want to show her bad side to the person she's in love with.  
A very reasonable, easy-to-understand motivation.

Normally, people try to change themselves to hide that side, but
Krische-sama’s way of changing the world around her is just unreasonably
characteristic of her.

More than a pure and innocent child who loves peace, she's a troublesome
lovesick girl. That's what Krische-sama is to me, and she's still an
incurable madwoman.

—I opened my eyes to the dazzling morning sun.  
Getting up was troublesome, and I laughed, “Am I not dead yet?”

Looking outside from the window, a ridiculously large tree was in full
bloom with rainbow-colored flowers.  
It's the kind of thing only Krische would do, without thinking about
others. When I was told that it was made for a love nest, I wondered how
many people would understand, and anyone who did would be a madman.  
If I heard it without knowing, I would have been surprised that such a
foolish story exists.

The frantic sons had come last night, it seems.  
A faint moon hung in the sky.

I feel surprisingly good. I think I'll go to the shop.

The old man in the mirror looked like he could die any day. My forehead
and crown are bald.  
“I can’t laugh at the captain,” I chuckled wryly.  
Though the captain just shaved his head, he wasn't bald.

Scratching my unkempt beard, I splashed water on my face and went out of
the room. The grand long corridor.  
Thanks to the generous people who paid with drinks, the inn became quite
a nice three-story building, but it’s inconvenient for an old man to
live in.  
As you get older, you get pushed to the edge of the second floor, and
the corridor seems even longer.

From the first floor, I heard lively voices.  
Today’s business seems to be good.

"Father, are you alright? You're suddenly walking around."

My old daughter, who had just come up the stairs, said in a weary
tone.  
My beloved daughter, who once had a flawless complexion, is now a
wrinkled, nagging old woman. I laughed, saying, “We’ve gotten old,” and
leaned on her shoulder.

"Going down the stairs is troublesome. I want to eat downstairs for
once, take me."

"....Really now. What if you fall down by yourself?"

"It’ll be a fitting death for me."

I laughed at my daughter’s sigh and went downstairs.

Many guests were in the spacious shop, talking excitedly about the tree.
Several old men from the neighborhood were at the counter, drinking
alcohol since morning.

"What, Tagel, you still haven't died yet?"

"I heard you were bedridden."

"I’ll probably be dead tomorrow."

“This is good,” I said to my daughter and sat next to Tagel.  
The honorable sergeant major of the Black Century.  
He was a handsome man, and even as a dying old man, he remained the
same.  
The fact that he still keeps his beard neatly trimmed is typical of him.

"I felt that way, but I feel surprisingly well today."

"It’s a coincidence. My magic is surprisingly obedient today."

"I think it’s the influence of that tree… but either way, it’ll only
last a little while. I thought I’d have a final meal here while I’m
feeling well."

Tagel dipped bread into the lamb stew and put it in his mouth.  
The scent wasn’t unpleasant.  
It's a bit heavy for breakfast, but the herbs made it refreshing.  
I nodded, satisfied that it was made as instructed.

"Kali, I’ll have the same."

"Okay."

My daughter gave me a glass of water and went to the kitchen.

"I thought I wouldn't wake up this morning.  
I was feeling good last night, recalling old memories."

"Consider it a kind consideration from Krische-sama, to let you die
looking at your own shop at the very end. You’ve lived a long life after
all."

"You’re a positive guy, which I don’t like."

"I’m going to enjoy even my last moments. If I draw that tree, I can die
peacefully.”

While drinking water from my cup, I heard silly laughter from behind.
What’s so funny in the morning?  
They’re quite the rascals, drinking alcohol this early.

I poured Tagel’s wine into my empty cup.

"You'll be scolded."

"You’re drinking secretly with your family, too. Openly drinking is
better than that."

"What, someone here will tell someone from my family about it by
evening.  
I'm ready for a lecture while I'm drinking."

I looked at Tagel laughing and put the wine to my lips. It’s cheap, but
not bad. It’s delicious after all this time.

"No fighting. Let's enjoy our last drink."

"That's good.  
I feel like talking about old times for once."

"What else is there to talk about when you’re old other than old times?"

I held out my cup to Tagel, who was holding the bottle.

"….Even the moon is hazy and has disappeared somewhere.  
That’s a good story to tell."
