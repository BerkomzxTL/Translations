# Chapter 341 - A Duel in the Mansion Garden Between an Ojou-sama and a Servant

A deep azure, tinged with magic, painted shades across the blue sky,
while the swaying trees shimmered.  
The fantastical brilliance of the sky and sun were now commonplace,
everyday occurrences.  
Though named Chrisnate, that name was rarely used.  
More often, it was "over there" and "over here," "that way" and "this
way."  
It was only later that she realized that giving it a name was
pointless.  
The name was chosen to prevent it from getting a silly name like
"floaty-fluffy," but she hasn’t heard the word Chrisnate in a thousand
years.

The mansion and everything else. For Selene and the others, that was
about the extent of their distinctions.

"Hee hee, I can't seem to land a blow.  
As expected of a Ojou-sama."

"……Perhaps you should try a little harder?"

"Even if I tried harder, I'm already trying my best..."

She gave a wry smile of exasperation, her red hair swaying.  
She was slightly shorter than Selene. Her pure white apron dress
remained unchanged, as did her youthful features and composed
expression—at least, she had never seen her genuinely frustrated. Selene
had been alive for a thousand, two thousand years.  
Whenever the name Berry Argan came up, the image that always sprang to
mind was that infuriatingly calm smile.

In her hand she held a curved blade, a favorite of Krische's. Her stance
was formless, the blade hanging loosely.  
For her small stature, similar to Krische's, this curved sword seemed to
be just the right weight.  
I doubted that, though.  
In the distant past—when she was training young Selene—she had
effortlessly wielded a longsword, and whatever weapon she used, that
wouldn't change.

I know to my annoyance that she is a genius.  
She was the kind of person who could effortlessly leap over a distance
others struggled to jump, a pathological perfectionist who honed her
skills as naturally as breathing.  
Even her handling of magic is evidence of this—from the time she was
"over there," her posture and the flow of magic around her were similar
to Krische's, possessing a refined, waste-free beauty.  
She wasn't the kind of easy opponent whose moves you could predict from
the flow of their magic.

On top of all that, she's extremely competitive, with a first-rate
personality and viciousness. She doesn't avoid unwinnable battles, she
only fights battles she can win—that's Berry Argan. She's holding a
sword now because this is just 'play'. She makes a clear distinction
between play and a real fight; she never goes all out in play, and for
her, play is a stepping stone to future battles.

In a board game with no element of chance, a score of 100 to 0 would be
possible. I admitted that I could never win against someone with that
level of intellect, but Berry is undefeated even in games where chance
and luck play a role.  
Even if there's a game where she only has a one or two in ten chance of
winning, she'll inevitably use those one or two victories in a 'real'
battle—that's the kind of woman Berry Argan is. For victory in a 'real'
battle, she will calmly lay out invisible groundwork spanning
centuries.  
Her every movement, every word, is suspicious; even if you beat her with
a stick, tie her to a rock, and sink her in water, you can't be sure of
anything.

"My turn."

"Yes, please."

Selene's advance—a Zain-style move that sends magic rippling out—like an
arrow released from a bowstring.  
Berry counters by stepping half a pace out of range. This was the key
earlier, ending with Selene's blade pressed against her neck.  
But this time, she minimized the distance with a half-step retreat,
simultaneously stepping in under the longsword to swing her curved
blade.

There was no strain or intensity in the flash aimed at her sword arm.
The lack of presence resembled Krische's, causing a momentary delay in
reaction. Selene dodged the blow by pulling back her arm and arching her
back—just as she was about to leap back, Berry launched a surface kick
timed to the swing.  
Feeling a chill, Selene seized the opening, stepped forward, and thrust
her sword at Berry's neck.

"I thought it would work..."

"You're underestimating me."

If Selene had only dodged with her arm and torso, the surface kick would
have been decisive.  
If she'd been careless due to the difference in skill, she would have
been easily thrown, but you can't be careless against Berry.  
With a single Zain sword strike, she reads your movements, anticipates
and adjusts the distance—I had a feeling she would do that.

When her sword was pressed against her neck earlier, she was
defenseless.  
That doesn't mean she couldn't react at all. Selene had practiced the
Zain sword, and Berry had occasionally watched her. The speed was within
her predictions—in fact, her face showed no surprise as the blade
touched her neck; it seemed she was calmly assessing Selene's posture
and foot placement.  
As if to ascertain how far Selene's thrust could reach.  
While praising Selene's skill with a smile, she was gathering
information with her eyes, and calmly devising a strategy in her mind.

This won't work, but what about this? She gathers information,
neutralizing each of Selene's moves one by one. Someone against whom
once used techniques won’t work again. She has the eyes and the sense to
do that; her handling of magic is extremely refined, adaptable, and
flexible. Just as Selene has honed her swordsmanship over these years,
Berry's virtual muscles have been further refined through countless days
of practice.

Selene, too, has reached a point where she forgets she's using body
augmentation.  
However, even though she uses advanced magic flawlessly, Berry surpasses
Selene by several steps in terms of refinement and precision. Selene has
a significant advantage in terms of explosive power, but the naturalness
of her movements, which can cause a momentary delay in reaction—even a
slight lapse in concentration can be fatal.

There is still a large gap in skill.  
Yet, she still delivers attacks that give you a chill down your spine.  
What will happen if she sharpens her skills further?—She is truly a
worthy opponent.  
I needed an opponent like her.  
Swinging a sword is fun, but it's more fun when there's an opponent.

"Let's call it a day after five more bouts.  
I have to prepare dinner."

"Right.  
We'll continue another time…But don't think you'll win easily. I intend
to enjoy winning for another thirty years or so."

"Of course. I would never think that.  
This is merely a pastime for me..."

"Where else could you find someone who can fight this well simply as a
pastime!?"

Berry instantly twisted to avoid Selene's thrust—Selene immediately
moved to the left.  
A rear roundhouse kick burst forth from beneath her swirling skirt.
Selene dodged by twisting her body, launching a horizontal slash.  
There was no contact, and Berry, who had created distance, smiled wryly,
"That didn't work either."

No hesitation, no surprise at the surprise attack. Berry is truly a
formidable opponent.

Berry, for once, picked up a sword at Selene's invitation to "give it a
try." Even at this point, the future battle was practically
decided—someday, she would definitely say something about settling
things with a sword fight. Berry Argan, who calmly laughs off a hundred
or a thousand defeats during play, wins in the thousand-and-first real
fight. The thing to consider is how to defeat and make her cry in that
thousand-and-first match.

After that, Berry only picked up a sword a few times a year.  
Selene won every time, but Berry steadily honed her swordsmanship. With
magic, the mental image plays a major role. Because magic moves the
body, if one can manipulate magic with near-perfect precision, it should
be theoretically possible to move the body as one imagines. If one can
properly visualize the correct technique in their mind, one can practice
even without a sword.

Naturally, relying solely on magic to control the body isn't as easy as
it sounds. Selene was only able to do this in a true sense after coming
here, after obtaining her current body. It took a considerable amount of
time to overcome the habit of using muscles to move the body—to get rid
of tension.  
In the "other" world, only someone like Aleha could embody that
perfectly. It's a skill that even talented individuals spend their
entire lives mastering.

Berry, however, is already a top-class user of magic. On her first day
with this body, she was naturally using it as if it were second nature—a
truly infuriating woman.  
She had already laid the foundation for swordsmanship in the "other"
world; all she needed was knowledge and experience—despite not
practicing with a sword daily, in the past few decades she has honed her
skills to the point where Selene feels threatened.

Probably, while Selene was sparring with Krische, or watching her
instruct Lila and Elvena, she picked up on subtle habits and fought them
in her mind. As evidence, Berry's swordsmanship is a nasty style, oozing
pure malice.  
When they spar, Selene invariably finds herself in awkward positions or
stances.

Exploiting an opponent's weaknesses is standard battle procedure.  
But few people could do it as thoroughly as she does. She collects
information from watching Selene's movements, understands her habits and
preferred style, and focuses on preventing her from fighting
comfortably.  
For now, Selene has won every match, but it's questionable whether those
victories were truly hers.

Unless there's a significant difference in skill, it's difficult to win
ten to zero in a sword fight. Unconscious carelessness,
fatigue—fluctuations in condition lead to minor mistakes that aren't
necessarily poor choices. And if these accumulate, even by chance,
defeat will inevitably come. In fact, there have been several close
calls where she almost lost.  
She won them all, but it's likely a trap.  
—She’s intentionally allowing herself to win to lure Selene into
complacency.

She wouldn't reveal her trump card in mere 'play'.  
If there's any doubt, it’s almost certain that she has hidden the key to
victory against Selene. Berry will do anything to win, she’s a twisted
woman.  
She lacks the concept of fair and square, of enjoying a competitive
battle, and mutual respect and encouragement—the wholesome and healthy
joys that other people feel. She doesn’t have the refreshing atmosphere
found when Kolkis and Aleha sparred.

Berry Argan is the kind of woman who enjoys kicking a tied-up opponent
with a smile.  
Her obsession with winning goes beyond competitiveness—it's a sickness.

The day came about fifty years after Berry began to wield a sword.

"Alright. Fine. …As the Ojou-sama says, let's settle this with swords."

"Huh?"

That statement ended a heated argument in the mansion's meeting room.

Last time, Selene lost, and Berry got her desired deserted island
survival trip. This time, Selene's proposed nature cave exploration
tour, originally postponed, was supposed to take place.  
However, Berry, ignoring the agreement, suddenly proposed an underwater
shipwreck tour instead.

It was an arbitrary change of plans based on mood and whim; essentially
a declaration of war.

“'You know, we decided to go to the Kreesian magic crystal cave! And why
the sea again!?”

To Selene's predictable rebuttal, Berry gave a specious answer:

“'Ojou-sama, shallow seas and the deep sea are different.  
It’s like saying that mountains and grasslands are the same land. And
I'm not saying we won't go to the magic crystal cave. According to
Krische, there seem to be many similar caves in the deep sea, and we can
explore the deep sea while finding those magic crystal caves—'”

“'That's not the point! Do you understand?  
You're breaking the promise we made the other day, changing the
destination on a whim!'”

“'I believe you're forgetting, at the time we made the promise, the
Kreesian magic crystal cave was just one candidate.  
It was decided that we would go to a magic crystal cave... but to say I
broke a promise is quite hurtful.  
Where exactly we’ll go to a magic crystal cave is something to decide
now.  
It's rather selfish of you to insist on Kreesian just because you want
to go there...’"

“'Listen, I don't want to hear you call \*me\* selfish from anyone in
this world!’”

This was the outcome.  
Last time, it was a result of a battle, and Berry got her desired trip.
This time, Selene held the right of priority, and their opinions
differed. If they were going to settle this with a duel, Selene should
have the right to decide the rules of the duel.

No further sophistry would be tolerated. If she were to continue her
capricious demands, Selene suggested settling it with swords.  
After a moment of thought, Berry agreed. She had a truly infuriating
expression, as if she was resigned, a "whatever" kind of vibe.

"It's part of my duty as a tutor... though it's to correct your whims,
making the Ojou-sama lose face isn't my intention."

"Who's being capricious? …You accepted quite readily.  
Does that mean you devised a plan to win against me long ago?"

"Devise a plan or not, do you forget? Who taught you swordsmanship?"

"How many years ago was that!"

It was now two thousand years in the past.  
Feeling annoyed by her usual condescending attitude, Selene took a
breath and looked at Berry.

"Fine, if you're so confident, I won't say anything else. You said it
yourself, a sword fight.  
The battle will be in the garden, first hit wins... is that alright?"

"Oh, using your favorite sword, no handicaps?"

"Unfortunately, I've decided I won't underestimate you. ...Your demands
were too unreasonable today, so I'll give myself a slight advantage to
make it even."

"……Very well. Let's get this over with quickly."

"……Just say it."

Selene stood up, and Berry stood up in response. It was mid-afternoon.

"Uh, Berry? Lunch..."

"My apologies, I got carried away. Please wait a little longer."

"Uuu… yes…"

Krische, only thinking about lunch, hugged Kreschenta, who was sleeping
with her arms crossed, and was about to leave the room with Berry when—

"……Let's be clear, it's one-on-one.  
No two-on-one nonsense with that idiot."

"I don't think you need to be so suspicious..."

"If I don't say it, you’ll happily disregard common sense."

"Sigh… Where did we go wrong in your upbringing…"

"……You…"

Watching the three of them leave, I sighed and looked at the three who
remained.

"Berry-sama has such amazing confidence…With the current conditions, it
seems difficult for her to win against Selene-sama..."

"That kind of provocation is also Berry’s strategy. I’m used to it."

Saying this to Lila, who looked astonished, she tilted her head, looked
at me, and chuckled.

"You seem more excited than usual today."

"Well, I wanted to try a sword fight with Berry…She's annoying, but if
we fought normally, she would probably win at least once or twice. Even
when we sparred occasionally, there were some close calls…Judging by her
confidence earlier, it was definitely intentional that she wasn’t fully
aiming to win."

"……Indeed, her progress has been extraordinary…"

She nodded thoughtfully.

"If I had a bit more talent with the sword, I could be her opponent…I'm
sorry."

"I think you're quite talented...Don't apologize.  
I'm having enough fun sparring with you, and if you keep at it, you'll
get better."

Kreisharana upbringing truly showed itself; Lila's movements were far
from amateurish.  
She regularly sparred with Selene, significantly improving her skills.  
Now, she's quite skilled—definitely not someone to underestimate,
possessing both diligence and talent.  
Her martial arts, in particular, are exceptional.  
However, compared to Berry's, she probably felt inferior.

Berry is the best in the world, as that Krische blindly suggests.  
While ordinary people struggle, gasping for breath, to reach a certain
point, Berry effortlessly arrives there in a carriage of talent.  
If she were like Kolkis or Aleha, a seeker relentlessly pursuing
mastery, one could readily respect her. But basically, everything is a
side project for her. She wanders through the desert, while those beside
her thirst and suffer, nonchalantly pulls a caravan along, splashes
water around as if it's nothing—she casually squanders her abundant
talent daily. Even if she means no harm, anyone, however insensitive,
would be irritated by daily feasts next to them.

For Selene, defeating Berry was revenge for everything she had endured.
She wanted to soundly defeat Berry, even when Berry was serious amidst
her casual pursuits, and taunt her with, "It's because you do it
casually, why don't you try your hardest sometime?" This wasn't just a
battle between Berry and Selene. It was a clash between talent and
effort—Berry, who lived comfortably in her talent-powered carriage,
versus Selene, who threw her entire life's arduous journey into the
fight.  
If she defeated Berry, who was genuinely striving to win, an
indescribable joy would surely follow.

"It's a different kind of enjoyment, you see, my match with Berry.  
Well, the sword fight is fun, of course, but it's also like a childhood
goal, or something... a wall I must someday overcome."

"Fufu, you always say that."

Elvena chuckled, listening. Beside her, Anne was scratching her quill on
parchment—apparently recording the history of Selene and Berry's
battles.  
Because of two thousand years of recording Selene's defeats, she seemed
desensitized to it in a bad way.  
I could see text like, "How will Argan-sama trap Selene-sama today?" and
glared at Anne.

"...Anne. You surely think I'll lose again, don't you?"

"N-no... That's not true..."

"Fine. Watch. Today, I'll show you how different I am from before."

Selene stood up with a confident expression. Anne smoothly wrote down
these words, which had been repeated for two thousand years.

Then the two faced each other in the mansion's garden. Selene's eyes
narrowed when she saw the sword Berry held.

It wasn't the Krische sword she'd always used because it was easy to
handle; instead, she held a longsword Selene had previously forged. A
straighter sword, slightly longer than Selene's beloved longsword.  
Thin-bladed and slender, it was easy to handle despite its length. The
most striking feature was its inscription.

It wasn't just a sword, it was an inscription sword using artificial
Cuirist steel.  
The inscription was a simple yet powerful Enjin (延刃) style.  
By channeling magic, this already long sword would extend its magical
blade, further increasing its reach by a foot.

It was the memorable inscription sword Selene had painstakingly
completed by herself when she was still inexperienced with inscription
techniques.

"Ojou-sama, surely you won't say it's unfair?"

"Well, even an inscription sword is still a sword… I won't say it's
cheating."

It was one of her most successful creations; she couldn't deny that.
Using a regular sword against an inscription sword put her at a clear
disadvantage.  
The magic blade could choose its target; in Berry's capable hands,
defense would be impossible—even if you tried to parry it, the blade
would cut through.  
You could block the physical part, but if your sword was deflected and
you failed to parry, it would be over. Selene's signature move, parrying
her opponent's sword, disrupting their posture, and then winning the
fight, was rendered almost useless.

Also, the difference in sensation was significant. Berry had stubbornly
stuck to using only the Krische sword. Bringing out a longsword during a
fight was within expectations, but they'd been sparring for decades with
that sword. From a twenty-eight-inch curved Krische sword to forty-two
inches—almost four feet if you include the magic blade.  
The difference in reach was enormous.

Berry had always incorporated martial arts with the Krische’s curved
sword, engaging in close-quarters combat.  
This would undoubtedly change her fighting style drastically. Whether
she could easily erase that impression was doubtful.

"You're really serious about beating me with a sword, Berry. But I've
anticipated this… Don't think you can easily defeat my two thousand
years of experience. Besides, that apron dress in this match… What's the
meaning?"

"It was you who suggested we fight in the garden... and if it gets late,
you'll complain, right?"

"I won't complain about waiting for you to change. Though I don't think
you intend to anyway."

The apron dress was far from practical for movement.  
Provoking Selene and disrupting her composure by fighting in such attire
was probably one of the reasons. However, the skirt wasn't entirely a
drawback. The long skirt, covering her entire lower body, made it
difficult to predict her leg movements, unlike trousers. The clothing of
the warriors from the island nation in the East Continent was likely
designed for this purpose. They wore trousers with very wide hems.

Such clothing was unsuitable on the battlefield, as it risked being
grabbed (I've never seen anything like it except Krische's), but in a
one-on-one situation, a skirt wasn't all bad.

"I won't hold back. Even if I don't aim to injure, we're not going to
hurt each other, so I'm going all out for one hit, but don't complain if
your clothes rip."

"Well, that goes for me too... though, it's hard to strike you even
though it won't hurt, and I'll try my best not to hit you."

"...You..."

In terms of pure swordsmanship, Selene would naturally excel. In a fight
where they agreed not to cause injury, they couldn't swing their swords
at full force, diminishing the difference in skill. However, her current
body could withstand a blow from a serious sword. She had no intention
of holding back, and she wasn't someone to be told to do so.

A normal sword versus an Enjin inscription sword. Even if they fought
fairly, she would lose at least three or four times out of ten.  
And Berry would definitely have a hidden trick to achieve those three or
four victories.

She adjusted her breath, looked up at the sky, and reminded herself,
"Don't rush." Don't rush the fight until Berry revealed her trump card.
Don't lose your composure.

Opening her mind, which was narrowing its focus, she called to Krische.

"Krische, the signal—...?"

Krische, holding the sleeping Kreschenta, looked up at the sky.  
There was nothing on the mansion's roof, and Selene tilted her head.

"Krische-sama, is something wrong?"

"Ah, no… nothing…"

When Berry spoke, Krische shook her head. Then, she turned towards them
and created a magic orb with her fingertips.

The softly floating orb landed between Selene and Berry, slowly
descending to the ground.

Was there something on the roof?  
A trapdoor wouldn't be surprising, but the roof was a strange place to
set up something. There was also a chance a wind spirit simply flew
there.

Berry's face was calm.  
It was difficult to discern anything from a woman who could calmly
deceive people.  
She was definitely up to something, but was it related to Krische's
actions?  
No, that kind of thinking wasn’t helpful. She had to concentrate; she
was already in a position where she could lose.

She calmly positioned her sword, settling her body. The distance was six
ken—the maximum reach for a single step and strike. Because it was the
maximum, the lunge had to be at full power, maximizing inertia; it was
also a distance where she could easily be caught off guard. Berry would
certainly seize this opportunity. And with Berry using the inscription
sword, the counter-attack would definitely hit Selene. Even if she
dodged, Berry would have the initiative. She could be pressured, and the
likelihood of defeat was high.

Watching the magic orb descend, she shifted her grip from her primary to
a secondary hand. The moment the blue orb touched the ground and burst,
she drew her Zain sword.

"...!"

Berry's reaction was almost instantaneous. A slight step back,
retreating—she had perfectly anticipated it. It wasn't a gentle
half-step dodge but a minimal retreat based on precise calculations, to
ensure a successful counter-attack that would end Selene.  
A perfect shift in weight, breathtakingly masterful.

If Selene had launched a thrust there and then, it would have been a
defeat.  
Truly, Berry Argan, the woman who had inflicted two thousand years of
humiliation on Selene.

However, the Zain sword was also a feint.  
Selene, having stored the magic she'd honed to the point of bursting,
took a light step.  
She feigned a thrust, closing the distance to three ken.

Berry's body was poised for a counter-attack. Her weight was slightly on
her front foot.  
—She couldn’t dodge a Zain sword from this position.

With a glide across the lawn, and the moment she landed, she used her
honed magic to construct virtual muscles.  
It was Selene's signature killing move, something she'd never shown
Berry before. It was a feint that wouldn't work on Krische, who could
perceive every move of her opponent like a pause button, but even a
genius like Berry was still bound by common sense. Her dynamic vision
was beyond ordinary people, but she couldn't perfectly perceive the Zain
sword. She had always dodged based on her predictions.

However, the distance was three ken.  
Physically, she couldn't evade from that posture.  
With the certainty of victory, she lunged, unleashing a full-powered
thrust.

"—!?"

She saw a flash of magic.  
She felt a powerful gust of wind. The air surged towards her, and Berry,
having leaped, found herself on Selene's right, carried by the wind.  
Selene rolled to avoid the blow, which would have cleaved her head in
two, and delivered a heel kick.

She immediately stood up, frowning.

"...What?"

"What's wrong?"

"I said a sword fight, right?"

"Yes. But you didn't say we couldn't use magic."

Berry replied with a carefree smile.  
This woman, Selene felt her blood boil, but she calmed herself.  
She exploited loopholes. Berry Argan was that kind of woman.  
It was a lapse of concentration—she had been carried away by the idea of
a sword fight. She should have explicitly confirmed a fight limited to
physical enhancements, swordsmanship, and martial arts.

"Of course, feel free to use anything you want, Ojou-sama. It's fair; I
won't complain."

"Ah, you..."

"If you insist... how about we change the rules now? The world of
competition is cruel, but I admit I was acting childish. As a servant, I
should respect my master and accommodate the Ojou-sama, who's not
skilled in magic, but..."

It was an obvious provocation. This woman had a truly twisted
personality. Selene couldn't use magic while wielding a sword. However,
banning magic now and winning wouldn't mean a real victory. She had to
defeat Berry, who was going all out to win.

"...It's a sword fight. If you fly around and blast magic, it won't be a
fight. Let's prohibit us from being more than ten ken apart."

"Ten ken... fine."

"Everything else is allowed. You can use magic to restrain me or
whatever you want; I'll win despite that."

"Impressive, Ojou-sama. You're decisive."

"Save your mockery for later. I'll make you howl."

She picked up a pebble from the ground and flicked it.

The odds had clearly turned against her.  
However, the word fair was true. To consider this a real match, she had
to defeat Berry, who was using magic without hesitation. And using
magic, Berry would have no excuses for losing.

It wasn't hopeless. Berry, who effortlessly manipulated magic, required
concentration to do so. Even for Berry, while wielding or dodging a
sword, she could only use simple magic.  
Earlier, she manipulated the wind to hinder Selene and circled around to
her right, but her follow-up strike on Selene, who had rolled away, was
slightly delayed.  
Perhaps if she'd completely lifted Selene into the air, she would have
won.

But she didn’t; she couldn't.  
It was impressive that she used magic at that brief moment, even
deflecting the fatal blow—it must have been close to her limit. If
Selene kept attacking, keeping the distance close and trapping Berry
within sword range, there was a good chance she could win.

Selene observed the falling pebble.  
Time slowed down.  
She saw Berry with her usual calm smile, catching every detail, every
movement, every subtle magical flow.  
To use magic, she needed to take control of the surrounding magic. Like
a painting—preparing a blank canvas before painting—she had to prepare
and stabilize the base for the inscription.  
Then, she could perform the inscription.

If she had been vigilant, she could have sensed the magic manipulation
and the prelude to the spellcasting. Berry cast spells like lightning,
but if she'd sensed the magic manipulation, she could have anticipated
it. It wasn't about the rules. It was her carelessness, Selene
acknowledged.

Selene Christand possessed an extraordinary, almost pathological
self-discipline.  
She wouldn't forgive her own shortcomings. At the same time, she now had
the strength to accept her inadequacies. Faced with countless hardships,
regrets, and struggles, she had overcome each obstacle, strengthening
her core.

She reflected without being imprisoned by her mistakes. Changing her
understanding of the situation, she focused all her abilities solely on
winning this fight.  
Berry Argan, with her calm expression, was her opponent.  
She was a ruthless, unscrupulous woman who would do anything to win.  
You could tell from her expression. This magic wasn't her trump card.

She would use even this magic as a feint to defeat her.  
She wouldn't overlook even the slightest movement.

And at that moment, Selene's concentration was sharp enough to allow her
to do just that. Because of this, she didn't notice Krische's gaze from
behind her.

"—!!"

The moment the pebble landed, she closed the six-ken distance. The
longest range—but that was only a moment ago. She had to exceed her
limits to defeat this redhead.

With her concentration exceeding its limits, she could perceive her
surroundings even during maximum acceleration. Berry Argan would
definitely evade this attack.  
But Selene wouldn't let her counter-attack.  
The instantaneous lunge, called like an arrow—she only needed to refine
the power just released at the very instant.

A Zain sword aimed at Berry, dodging the first strike.  
This wasn't a feint. A theoretically fastest double thrust.  
Even the lightning-fast inscription couldn't reach this blade.

During the acceleration, time stretched.  
She saw Berry's irritating calm smile. She was like a sister, a mother,
a best friend, and someone she admired, a rival she would surely surpass
someday. Just before she reached her, the necessary magic surged. After
this strike was dodged, again—dodged—

"...Huh?"

—The Zain sword pierced Berry's chest. Berry didn't dodge; she didn't
even move. But why was the blade piercing her?  
The smiling Berry turned into water with a splash, her inscription sword
falling to the ground, and

"—Eit!"

From behind, Krische's curved sword landed on Selene's neck.

"Fufu, it seems I've won this match."

As if in a well-worn automaton, when Selene turned, there was the
redhead servant, Berry Argan, with a big smile on her face.

"When I noticed Krische-sama’s gaze, I thought what would happen… It was
a great fight to watch."

"...Berry, what was that?"

"I thought you might suggest a sword fight today, so I secretly prepared
a water puppet yesterday.  
I made it so I could control it from the other side of the dimension; I
was hiding on the roof…"

Berry nodded.  
It was a close match.

"I signaled 'shh', but… fufu, shall we prepare lunch then?"

"Ehehe... Yes!"

Krische, being petted by her, was exceptionally cheerful.

Limitless concentration and swordsmanship. Probably, she had reached the
peak of her ability in that instant. The intense moment, along with
everything that had happened, slowly surfaced in Selene's mind.  
Fifty years of training, deliberately bringing out the inscription
sword, using magic as a provocation—everything was a distraction for the
surprise attack from behind.

Selene felt dizzy, pressed her forehead, dropped her sword, and

"Well, it was a disappointing result for the Ojou-sama, but luck plays a
part in battles. Consider this a submarine wreck tour—"

"N-n-n…"

"??"

"—There's no way I'll accept that! How cowardly do you have to be to be
satisfied, you coward!?"

Her face flushed red with fury.
