# Chapter 352 - Krische's Krische: Daytime

There was a small hut built right next to the mansion—or what was once a
small hut.  
Initially, it was just a simple hut, but then another hut was built next
to it, a second floor was added, and extensions were repeated until it
became a small mansion itself.

"Selene, may I enter?"

After knocking and entering, Krische saw scattered objects everywhere.
It was the complete opposite of the well-organized mansion, a chaotic
mess. Inside, Selene, wearing a leather apron and her long hair tied up
high, was working intently, shaping clay on a potter's wheel.

Shelves were filled with what looked like finished products and failed
attempts, unbaked clay pieces. On the table lay tools for crafting,
carelessly placed, along with clay-stained water and lumps of clay. On a
clay tablet, a mysterious drawing resembling a design was sketched.

Every time Krische comes, Krische thinks she should tidy up a little
more, but Selene considers this organized. If Krische tries to clean up,
she'll insist, "Don't touch that; leave it there," and she's very
particular about it.  
Krische’s only allowed to touch things with Selene's permission.

For the past few years, she's been fond of making pots. Before that, it
was glasswork; before that, wood carving. This hut was built when she
first started crafting, which was making blades, but Krische hadn't seen
her forge iron for about two hundred years. Naturally, the eastern knife
she bought for cooking fish is still imprisoned.

Selene says,

'The straightest, shortest path isn't always the right answer. There are
things you can only understand by seeing and touching them, and I'm on
that long journey right now.'

That's what she apparently means, but Krische still couldn’t see the
connection between the knife and pot-making.  
Selene certainly wasn't a skilled craftsperson, but if she'd focused
solely on forging knives for several hundred years without any detours,
she probably would have become quite adept at it.  
Thinking about it, it seems like she’s just taking a ridiculously
roundabout way to me.

However, Krische’s a servant. And Selene is the ojou-sama of this
mansion.  
It's not a good idea to discourage the ojou-sama, who seems to enjoy
this mysterious detour, and so Krische can only watch with a sense of
subtle injustice.

Shurushu, shurushu, shurushu, the potter's wheel turned, and Selene's
face was one of intense concentration as she watched it. The clay was
thinly stretched, drawing a curve—then, \*fwa\*, it collapsed.

"Oh… Aaaah…"

Seeing this, Selene covered her face, leaned back, and looked up at the
sky. Krische didn't understand, but judging by her reaction, it seemed
to be a good outcome for Selene.

Krische poured tea into a wooden cup, gazing at the collapsed clay, lost
in thought.  
A good servant knows how to offer comforting words at a time like
this.  
Krische nodded thoughtfully, and she smiled.

"Selene, it's okay. They say that everything with form will eventually
break… and to be broken from the start is, in a sense, innovative as
art."

"That's not comforting at all, you idiot."

"Mmm…"

Apparently, what's valued is novelty and unprecedented form and
expression rather than practicality, but art is a rather difficult
concept. Krische still doesn't quite understand it.

Selene washed her hands in a water bucket, wiped them with a towel, and
then picked up her cup and took a sip of tea.  
Leaning back against the backrest, she stretched, moving her arms up and
wiggling them from side to side. Krische also stretched, and she glared
at Krische, saying, "Don't copy me."

Every time Krische sees Selene, she usually stretches like that. It's
become almost like a greeting.

"Hee hee. What are you making today?"

"A vase. Remember, you all brought back some beautiful flowers the other
day."

"Beautiful flowers…"

Krische tilted her head, pondering, and then slapped her hand on her
knee at the word 'brought back'.

"Aopika grass, right?"

A light blue flower, a new species of grass that glows blue and brightly
under the moonlight. Berry really liked that flower field and brought
some back.  
She and Berry made a flowerbed for it in a corner of the garden just the
other day.

"…I still think that naming sense is questionable. Well, they were
pretty, so I thought I'd decorate my windowsill with them."

"Yeah… but you have quite a few extra vases in the storage room, don't
you? Twelve… no, since Anne broke two, there are ten now."

"I wanted to use the one Anne broke, precisely."

Selene sighed in exasperation.

"But there are still ten spares…"

"Flowers and vases are a set.  
There's a combination of this flower with this vase. "

"Combination…"

"How should I put this… well, it’s like cooking. There's a certain dish
for a certain kind of food, right? If all that mattered was getting it
in, you could just serve everything in a soup bowl, but you arrange the
food to make it look better and more appetizing; you think about the
color coordination."

"That's… certainly true."

Krische nodded in agreement.  
Selene is usually very particular about things Krische doesn't
understand, but this time, she has a point.  
'Cooking includes the presentation' (Quote from Berry).  
If you put it that way, then Krische understands.

Krische still only understands it superficially; Krische can't say
Krische understands the concept perfectly.  
It's not something simple that can be understood through logic.  
Whether something looks delicious is a very subjective concept.  
It's a very profound element of cooking.  
This must be something similar.

Selene took off her apron and patted her knees, inviting Krische to
sit.  
Krische sat down and kissed her cheek.  
She pinched Krische’s cheek playfully.

"You really are quite straightforward, like a simple dish…"

"It's more that Selene has strange preferences—uugh!"

"They aren't strange preferences!"

She pulled Krische’s cheek while sighing.

"Teaching you about art is quite difficult… for example, Berry often
rearranges the furniture in the mansion, right?"

"…? Yes."

"That's a kind of art, too. She moves things around and combines them,
thinking, 'This looks better here, that looks better there.' You do that
too, right?"

"……That's, kind of…"

"What do you think about when you adjust things?"

Krische thought for a moment and answered,

"Mmm… beautiful, um, something Berry would like…"

Selene raised an eyebrow and sighed.

"…Well, that’s alright. What you do is also a kind of art. Art is about
creating something that evokes emotion in the viewer—joy, surprise,
admiration for beauty, etc."

"The viewer finds it beautiful…"

"Basically, yes. There's art created in the form of objects, and there's
also art that creates space through the arrangement of those objects.
The Aopika grass flowerbed is art, arranging the orchard is art, even
the garden is art. Creating something that makes people happy, in any
form, and having that feeling transmitted makes it art."

"Cooking is also a form of art," Selene said, and Krische nodded
seriously.

"…Right. Indeed, when Krische first came to the mansion, Krische was
incredibly moved by Berry's cooking."

How immature Krische was back then. Krische nodded repeatedly,
reflecting on the past.

Those dishes transcended Krische’s previous concept of deliciousness.  
Her dedication to cooking.  
Krische was constantly moved every day, and that hasn't changed.  
Even the most familiar dishes, even a simple cookie, Berry’s touch
creates small moments of wonder.

Now, in terms of skill, Krische has slightly surpassed her in a few
areas. But Krische’s always moved by her little touches, her changes
each day. Berry’s touch is magical. With a pinch of salt or herbs, a
simple stir of the pot, she turns food into art.

"For Krische, Berry's cooking is the closest thing to the concept of art
Selene described. It truly is art."

"So…"

Selene nodded, raising an eyebrow again.

Krische remembered that Krische hadn't eaten pumpkin in a month.  
A pumpkin hollowed out, filled with a rich pumpkin white sauce, topped
with cheese and baked, scattered with herbs. Berry’s pumpkin art—pumpkin
gratin. The delicious taste made Krische’s mouth water. Krische decided
to request pumpkin gratin for dinner tonight.

"Well, cooking has a purpose—to be eaten. The kind of art I do is
simpler; it only aims to convey emotion,"

"Mmm, simple…"

"Yes, disregarding deliciousness, or practicality as a tool,"

Selene stated, pointing a finger.  
Art is still a difficult concept.  
It's probably similar to the concept of beauty.

Krische feels the sense of something being beautiful or wonderful; it's
probably a similar feeling to Selene's, even if not exactly the same.
But when asked what is beautiful or wonderful, Krische has trouble
answering. Something beyond words.  
It's difficult to explain the feeling, the reason for the feeling. Words
always seem to slip around the edges of something, never quite able to
convey the essence of it; it's frustrating.

Ah, as if struck by an idea, Krische smiled.

"Is it like words?"

"……Words?"

"Yes. When we have conversations like this, it's sometimes very
difficult. To understand Krische’s own feelings, what Krische’s feeling…
for example, happiness or joy.  
It’s easy to convey that, but it’s very difficult to convey how much and
what kind of happiness or joy Krische’s feeling."

There are no words that can accurately capture these feelings. Words
seem precise, but they are quite rough. Even with a thousand words, you
can't convey everything accurately, nor can you fully express yourself.

'Words are ambiguous and uncertain.  
Therefore, what you feel, what you desire, what you wish for is the
answer.'

What Berry has always tried to convey is probably something similar.
Using ambiguous and uncertain words, she always tries to convey
something beyond words.

It's not something you can just hand over like a candy.

The moment you try to give it, it melts away and disappears.

"…Fufufu, yes,"

Selene nodded happily.

"In a sense, this is also a kind of word."

Then, she pointed to the collapsed clay.

"Something that cannot be expressed with sounds or words, shaping it
into one form. Today, I'm trying to express it with clay, but wood and
stone carving, silverwork, glasswork, music, painting… ultimately, even
the way of life…"

"Way of life…"

"Yes.  
Different people cherish different things, choosing different ways of
life. Even if their thoughts and everything else are different,
beautiful people are beautiful. It's something that can be conveyed even
without words."

Selene closed her eyes happily, and Krische kissed her gently.

"This is one of them, too, isn't it?"

"Fufu, well, it's one aspect of it, I suppose."

Selene chuckled and caressed Krische’s cheek.

"But, I see… the way of life…"

Krische pondered for a moment, nodding.

"You've seen a lot, haven't you?"

"Yes. Krische thinks Krische kind of understands what you're trying to
say, Selene."

"It's okay if you just kind of understand. I used to dislike things that
were unclear, but now I think it's okay to have lots of answers that are
'I don't know.'"

Selene happily shrugged and raised both arms.  
She stretched, swaying her body.

"You can only pretend you understand things. Interpretation is like
deciding the color of a rainbow. If you think the rainbow is beautiful,
that's enough—no unnecessary reasoning is needed."

"The analogy is a bit difficult, but hee hee, Krische understands what
you're saying, like Berry."

"……Listen,"

For the third time, she raised an eyebrow, slightly glaring at Krische.
Krische didn’t notice and took a sip of her tea, closing her eyes.

"Krische, I think you probably don't understand even half of what Berry
usually thinks about… but I always think Berry's way of life is very
beautiful."

"F, fuun…"

"Since Krische met Berry, she's always been thinking about
someone—Krische, Selene, the master, or someone else… and it’s the same
now. She spends her days thinking about others, working, taking care of
things, and she seems happy… Krische thinks that's Berry’s happiness."

She hugged her cup happily, her long silver eyelashes shading her eyes.

"Berry is quite a strange person…"

"…Quite is an understatement."

"Hee hee, but Krische thinks that way of life is very beautiful… that's
why Krische always wants to be like Berry."

She smiled.

"So… so…"

Selene nodded, her eyebrows twitching.  
Krische didn't notice and replied, "Yes."

"Of course, Krische’s still far from Berry… so, as Berry's assistant,
working together… Krische’s goal is to become a servant who takes care
of Berry in the ways Berry herself doesn't."

Having said that, she said,  
"Krische’s not good at explaining things."

"It's come across more than sufficiently, so don't worry."

"Is that so?"

"Yes, really, it’s incredibly clear."

"……Oh."

Selene snatched her cup and roughly placed it on the table. Krische
looked at Selene, confused.

"……? Um, Selene, are you angry…?"

"Oh, does it seem like that? I’m happy it got across so well."

"Se, Selene…?"

Selene picked Krische up and threw her onto the sofa. Then she straddled
Krische and glared.

"Well, unlike Berry, I’m not very skilled at conveying things without
words, and I’m aware of that."

"But Selene seems… skilled at that, too…"

"Are you saying I'm always angry?"

"N, no…"

Krische’s eyes darted around. Why was Selene angry?— countless question
marks arose.

"M…?"

Then her lips pressed against Krische’s, and as she was still confused,
Selene said,

"Well, this is one answer to your question."

"An, answer…?"

"Well, why do you think I'm angry?"

"U, um…"

The answer was a kiss—a way of conveying affection. And Selene showed
her that it was an answer.

Because she loves Krische, she is angry.

Krische didn't understand the meaning of this word association, and
Krische reconsidered. Instead of angry, perhaps she's scolding Krische.

—Right, she's scolding Krische because she loves Krische.

But Krische still didn't understand why she was being scolded.

If Krische’d said something to Selene, Krische would understand, but
they were just having a normal conversation, talking about Berry. And
again, a bolt of lightning struck her mind.

Krische remembered Selene from when they were still over there. She said
she was jealous of Berry—no, but that had been resolved long ago, and
Selene herself had said, 'Let's not talk about that again.'  
So, it couldn't be that.

Even with a godlike intellect, Krische couldn't find the answer, no
matter how hard she thought.

"G…!"

Then Krische recalled their earlier conversation and suddenly realized.

"……Selene"

"……What?"

"Krische thinks Krische understands the answer."

Selene looked surprised, a little flustered.  
Her cheeks flushed slightly as she asked.

"Th…then, tell me."

Krische nodded and closed her eyes.

"Krische’s been thinking, and Krische thinks this is it."

Krische opened her eyes, nodding as if she understood, and looked
straight at Selene.

"Krische doesn’t know. —That's Krische’s answer, Krische."

"…………"

"And what Krische should convey is… mm!"

As Krische pressed her lips to hers, she smiled.

"Is it like this?"

"…………"

"Hee hee, what do you think?"

—Krische doesn't understand, but Krische loves you.

With an air of satisfaction, Krische was in a good mood.

Selene looked down at her face coolly and sighed deeply.

"Sigh… I was a fool to have expected anything of you."

"Eh…? Uuugh"

"It's true, I said it's okay to have the answer 'I don't know.' But
Krische, sometimes you have to give a proper answer, and this is one of
those times."

"Fe, felele…?"

"You're wrong," she said, pulling her cheek while sighing again. Then,
looking angry, she leaned closer and whispered,

"…As punishment, I'll keep your company until I'm satisfied."

She then pressed her lips to hers.  
Krische accepted it in confusion, wondering what she had done wrong.

Sometimes, that's how Krische's afternoons ended.
