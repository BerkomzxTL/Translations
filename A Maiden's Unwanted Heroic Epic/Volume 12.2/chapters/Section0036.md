# Chapter 346 - Charm 5

The trigger for the downfall of the Argan family—I heard that the war
with Elsren was over several months after the fact.  
My days were uncertain, as I lived only thinking of that day, not of
tomorrow.  
It felt like years had passed, but the seasons hadn't even completed a
full cycle, so it probably wasn't that long.

Ultimately, the war was a decisive victory, greatly expanding Alberan
territory and bringing them rich lands. I remember the people at the
celebratory gathering were quite boisterous.

Some were beaming, others grieving.  
Even the nobles attending seemed to have the temperament of merchants.
They simply chased profit, gambling on their country's wars. Alberan's
victory was apparently unexpected, and the faces in the crowd changed
somewhat.

For Lazura, nothing much changed.  
The people she sold flowers to changed slightly, and the whispers she
heard changed accordingly.

Many whispered shallow words of love.  
They pretended to sympathize with Lazura's situation. They'd say things
like, "It's difficult to immediately find the money to cover your debts,
but I'll do my best to help you." At first, I’d get my hopes up, only to
be speechless when I'd see that man with another woman. Once I realized
it was just "a game," I was disappointed in my own foolishness. Many
held the title of noble, but true nobles wouldn't show themselves in a
place like this.

As it was repeated, I became accustomed to it. My emotions wore down,
and I grew cold towards their words. I wondered if, even if one day
someone genuinely said those words, I would be able to believe them.
Eventually, I would probably look upon such words with suspicion. To
shake off such thoughts, I focused on the present.

The medication provided for contraception wasn't bad, but perhaps I
didn't react well to it. My body always felt slightly listless, and that
dragged down my mood. Even if I tried to be optimistic about the future,
anxieties remained. For example, what if my health deteriorated
severely, making me unable to work? I intended to never give up, no
matter how many years passed, but there was nothing I could do about my
body.

At that juncture, Roland visited after a long time. He cheerfully told
Lazura that she was quite popular and that an unusual suitor was
interested in her. He wouldn't say who it was until they were in the
carriage on the way to the mansion.

“……His Highness?”

“Yes.  
He returned after the great victory…and heard rumors about Lazura. He
wanted to see you, personally.”

I had thought it must be an extraordinary suitor, enough to warrant
sending Berry in a separate carriage, but this explained it.  
I’d seen many people of high noble standing like the Dukes, but a
prince. And this one, rumored to be granted the rank of Marshal for his
recent military achievements.  
Except for the King, he was a figure above the clouds, at the pinnacle
of all the nobility.  
A mere Baron's daughter couldn't easily meet him.

“That is good news…but you know the rumors, don’t you?”

“……I've heard them a few times.”

—His Highness is mad.  
Such stories had reached Lazura's ears.  
He was once a noble prince, loved by heaven, whose future was highly
promising, but from a certain day onward, he fell ill mentally and
indulged in abnormal pleasures, so the story went.

This gathering was originally a gathering of deviants. Even among them,
he stood out—a depraved man who gleefully told stories of how to cruelly
torture people. Even those people felt awe and terror towards him. That
man was Prince Gildenstein.

“I've heard he's stopped such amusements lately…but the rumors are true.
He's someone who doesn't see people as people…I once saw him, with my
own eyes, gouge out the eyes of a noble who had offended him, laughing
while doing so, calling it entertainment and then brutally killing him.”

“…………”

“Whatever you think of him, Lazura, I'm just a small-time villain. I
deal in people as commodities, so I have dealings with those with a
penchant for sadism, and I've seen several who are completely unhinged.
He is certainly one of those. You'll understand when you meet him.”

Roland said seriously, urging her to be respectful.

“It doesn't matter who buys you, that's the merchant's way…Lazura,
you're free to choose, and it's not a bad thing for me if His Highness
buys you. But, even as a petty villain, I believe I have some
compassion…you should think carefully before deciding.”

“You're worried about me.”

“If I could sell you for the same price, I'd want to sell you to a kind
master, you know. Sometimes even if it means slightly changing the
price…well, that's about my level of feeling.”

Roland laughed and warned her again.

“Don't take it lightly. Even if you wish for death, even that may not be
allowed…such pain exists in this world.”

“……Yes.”

Such things do exist.  
Physical pain, mental pain. I could imagine how painful it would be.

Upon arriving at the mansion, she stroked her sister's cheek before
entering.

“I’ll be back.”

“……Yes, nee-san.”

She hadn’t seen a genuine smile from Berry in a long while. Those large,
light brown eyes constantly questioned her.

Filled with a deep, twilight-like gloom, a dark expectation shimmered
within them. When would her pain end?

If Berry were to cling to her in tears, Lazura would gladly accept it,
laughing as she became defiled. She would feel completely relieved.

Under the banner of love, Berry is seduced into depravity. Under the
banner of love, Lazura inflicts pain.  
Yet, they remain together. Even so, they cannot separate, cannot let go.

Lazura thinks they are truly sisters.  
They seem different, yet entwined, close at hand.

Opening the door, a man sat on the sofa. A beautiful young man with
elegant golden hair.

His sculpted beauty, his blue eyes deep as the ocean floor, incredibly
deep—sending a chill down her spine as she glimpsed that abyss. Or
perhaps, they were gazing at her.

In terms of nature, he was similar to Roland and the others. Like when
assessing a commodity, but far colder, icy.  
He really looked at Lazura as an object.

Bowing her head to avoid his gaze,

“Sit.  
You may leave.”

“……Yes.”

Roland bowed and left the room without a word. A quiet fear was evident
in his voice and mannerisms. Even Roland, who looked down on everyone,
must have had something he couldn't defy.

As instructed, she sat on the opposite sofa. Bowing her head again, she
sat down and said, “Excuse me.”

“Lazura, was it?”

“Yes, Your Highness.”

She didn't shout, but a heavy pressure made an unpleasant sweat bead on
her back. Like her heart was being gently toyed with.

Royalty must be a kind of monster.

“You seem to be a prostitute. You defile your name for money, sleeping
with anyone. You're beneath contempt, even compared to the nobles. Do
you want money that badly?”

With a single word, he could decide the life or death of a person.  
Those who were born and raised to be like him are beings different from
ordinary people.  
It seemed like he was seeking conversation, but he wasn't. It was all a
pronouncement. A single displeasing word could feel like her heart was
being crushed.

Perhaps it was just her own weakness that made it seem that way. But
whatever the case, the word-demon before her didn't seem to be seeking
Lazura's answer to his question.

“Yes, Your Highness. That’s true.”

She simply killed her heart and answered as usual. Despite being
face-to-face, she couldn't understand what was in his eyes. She shifted
her gaze slightly, avoiding his direct gaze.

“Talk, I’ll listen.”

Treating it like normal conversation would be dangerous. It felt like he
was seeing through everything. She simply calmed herself.

“Of course, I won't give you money. After we've played, I'll throw you
out. You should bow your head and leave as usual once we're done.”

He curved his lips, as if watching a cheerful jester. He seemed to be
smiling, yet he wasn't.  
He was mocking her.  
She responded inanely, "Yes, Your Highness," repeating it like a fool.

He sat carelessly on the sofa, poured wine, and quietly sipped it.  
He listened to the story of the Argan family and how Lazura came to be
in this situation, seeming to view it as if it were an instrumental
piece or something of the sort. Or perhaps bird song. Either way, it
didn’t seem like he was receiving her words as words.

From his perspective, the Argan family was nothing but crawling dirt.  
Because of this man's attack on Elsren, her father died, the Argan
family fell, and she was involved in this rotten gathering, even the
people she flattered had fallen, and were crawling in the dirt. From his
viewpoint, Lazura and the others were probably like ants. He walked, and
accidentally crushed their nest. Even if an ant were to say, "My home
was on the path you walked," he wouldn’t feel any pain or interest.

Her life story held no value to him. That was likely the prelude.  
He listened perfunctorily, to issue some sort of pronouncement.

“—I see, I see. A pitiful story.”

Gildenstein spread his hands, a smile that wasn't a smile on his face.

“It's a story I've heard countless times, even as a drinking
companion.  
But I summoned you here.  
I must give you some reward. The war is over, and I feel good and my
purse is heavy.  
I feel like buying a rather expensive toy...Look into my eyes.”

—It felt like his tone had changed. The mocking tone was gone, just the
mocking itself remained. An emotionless, calm command.  
Her gaze, which had been slightly averted, was drawn into his eyes.

“It seems you have a sister. I will save her.”

An indescribable deep darkness spread in his blue eyes.

“……However, I will kill you. I will cut off your fingers and flay the
skin, making you unrecognizable.”

She was frozen, unable to look away.  
Her breath stopped, her heart crushed, her insides threatening to spill
out from her mouth.

“Kuku, you know my reputation, don't you? Don't think you're being
tested.”

Roland’s words came to mind. The choice was Lazura’s — she must have
understood this would happen.  
In fact, the mere ability to choose was a kindness. If the man before
her desired it, she couldn't even refuse Roland. And of course, Lazura
had no right to refuse. The word of the royal family was a pronouncement
to all others.

She closed her eyes for a moment.  
It wasn't a joke.  
Therefore, she could not defy the prince’s mercy.  
Even so, if she panicked and begged for forgiveness, would her life be
spared? Would she be discarded as a lost cause?

—But that wasn't the way of the nobility.

“Yes, Your Highness…if I may pledge one thing to your name.”

Opening her eyes, she looked straight into his.  
It wasn't about choosing or not.  
Lazura had already chosen.

“……Speak.”

In his cold words, this time there was no trembling. With a calm heart,
she spoke.

“If you will give my sister true love and happiness…then I do not mind.”

Even if she lost everything, she would not defile her own name. She
would never bend the way of life she had chosen. Even if she couldn't
manage it, that is how a noble should live.

Her sister was prepared to dedicate her body and soul for Lazura.  
If it had been Berry here, she would have spoken without hesitation. And
Lazura was Berry’s sister.

“If you will keep that oath even after I’ve gone mad, then I, Lazura
Argan, swear by my name to become Your Highness's.”

His blue eyes contained a deep darkness that seemed to hate all the
world.  
Strangely, those eyes overlapped with those large light brown eyes.  
A dark glow of extinguished hope, cursing even herself.  
In his eyes, there was a faint glimmer of something left behind.

It must be someone close.  
Unless they were pure, a person could not be wounded to such a degree.

If he made a vow, he would never break it. She felt that she could
believe that much.

She was dismissed unceremoniously and told to come back in a month,
perhaps, by Roland.  
Returning to the inn, she and Berry went to the bathhouse. After work,
they usually cleansed themselves there unless they were extremely
tired.  
The mansion bathhouse was mixed, and while Lazura could go alone, she
couldn’t take Berry. Luckily, this was a high-class inn. She often met
women doing the same work, but men and women were separated. Perhaps
because many of the users were like Lazura, the bathhouse was large. The
time was early, so it was empty.

Berry always washed Lazura as carefully as she would polish a jewel. She
carefully cleaned every bit of dirt. Lazura intentionally let Berry do
as she pleased.

It was self-harm for Berry, but it was also a sacred ritual. For Berry,
who lived for Lazura, the punishment of being protected by her sister
was a solace.  
She nurtured that hatred, as if her insides were boiling.  
By hurting herself, she endured.

It was far more painful than being defiled herself.  
Knowing that, Lazura prioritized herself, making Berry endure. If she
didn’t break somewhere, it would break somewhere else.

“Yes, it’s my turn to wash you, sister. I said I only talked, didn’t I?”

“……Yes.”

Before, Berry's body was not just thin, it was too small. Now, her body
had filled out healthily, and she had grown quite a bit taller.  
Getting proper nutrition, sleeping well, and walking beside Lazura were
likely factors. Compared to when she was at the mansion, her body was
full of vitality. Although she still had occasional fevers, the
frequency had greatly decreased, and lately her condition had been good.

Lazura thought it was ironic.  
What she couldn't achieve at the mansion was being achieved here.  
Berry was becoming more beautiful and maturing day by day.

What about next year?  
The year after?  
She’s still young, she could use that excuse to hold her sister back,
but for how long?  
If Lazura fell ill beforehand, or even if she didn't, it wouldn't take
long.

As they soaked in the bath, Berry snuggled close, hugging and stroking
Lazura’s arm.  
She leaned her cheek against Lazura’s.

“It’s so comfortable having no one else around for once.  
The private bath is nice.”

Lazura said so, looking at the ceiling.

“You probably know, but I had a high-class customer this time. It seems
I can take a break for a while.”

“……Is that so?”

No man would take a woman who had been summoned by the prince to his
bed. It was already spreading as a rumor. If they had a reservation, it
would only make it more difficult. Either way, she wouldn't be able to
work for a while, and Roland had said as much.

“Even if I laze around and rest tomorrow, I'll get tired of staying
cooped up in the inn every day.  
The kind of entertainment I can find in an inn doesn’t really let me
have fun.”

She stroked Berry’s head, and continued.

“So I thought, why not go sightseeing? When Father and I came here
before, you were so small that we couldn’t go see much, so I’d like to
see a bit of the Royal Capital.  
Will you come with me?”

Berry quietly replied, "Yes."

Together, they left the bathhouse, returned to their room, and sat on
the bed, wiping each other’s remaining moisture. Berry carefully tended
to Lazura's long hair.  
And it was Lazura’s job to take care of Berry’s long hair. She removed
the moisture, combed it, and knowing her own carelessness, carefully
took her time. During this time, Berry’s demeanor softened slightly.

Even after the moisture had been wiped from her smooth hair, she
continued for a while longer.  
As if to loosen something tense. She took a strand of her long hair,
smelled it, and kissed it.

“….Yes, beautiful.”

Smiling like that, she stroked her head as usual.  
Then, unexpectedly, her shoulders were pushed, and she collapsed.

“Nee-san”

While pushing Lazura down, she placed his hands on her shoulders.  
Her intelligent, large, light brown eyes peered into Lazura’s eyes. She
gazed for a while, as if searching, then narrowed her eyes.

“…I will always be with nee-san.”

Just as she had always watched Berry, she had always watched Lazura. She
thought this clever younger sister could not hide anything. Words that
didn't seek an answer.

It was a declaration, and an oath. Everything that could never be bent
resided in those words.

“…You are a noble, Berry.”

Unlike Lazura, Berry Argan did not worry. Without being told by anyone,
she would not hesitate for the sake of what she must protect. Because
she was weaker than anyone else, she was stronger than anyone else.  
This sister's name, surely, could not be defiled by anyone in this
world.

However, that is not the way people live. Even if one desires
perfection, there are things that should not be perfect.

“But, you are my sister.”

As she stroked her cheek, a definite hatred settled in her eyes. An
impossibly deep hatred pleaded for an even deeper love.

A twilight color, like waiting for the sun to set, dozing in the day and
night.  
It still seemed slightly bright, not setting as much as the prince's.
She thought her sister was more precious than anyone, yet she also
thought that she herself must never surrender.  
Lazura sinks, unable to escape the sweet obsession, the gentle
temptation of the night.

Touching her nose to her sinking body, she gazed intently into her eyes.
From the top of her head to the tips of her nails—even to a drop of
blood, everything about her sister claimed to be Lazura’s.  
Filled with desperate affection, her body, light as a feather, was
heavier than anything.  
Her gaze was so hot it felt like a burn.

Her sister always understood and tried to give her everything Lazura
desired at that moment.

“And, I am your older sister.”

She thought it was good that they weren’t twins. If they were, the
boundaries would undoubtedly have mixed and melted away. Just as her
sister was drawn to Lazura's bright side, Lazura, too, was more
attracted to her sister's dark side than anyone else.

Her sister, who said she possessed nothing, had everything Lazura
desired and gave it to her. If one was divided into two, it would be
only natural to try to become one again.  
Surrendering to that attractive force would be sweet.

Such a slight pretense was all that held back Lazura’s weak heart.

She drew close to the paper-thin boundary, stroking it, and kissed her
forehead.  
Bearing various thoughts and oaths.  
As if to convey them, slowly—gently stroking her pale pink lips with her
finger, she distanced herself.  
Suppressing words, she savored only that gentle touch.

— “I’m sorry,” she moved only her lips, and gazed at her moistened eyes.
She pleaded that she wanted to use that pretense a little longer, a
little while longer. Lazura was cowardly, sly, and selfish. Every time
she confirmed her love, she gained a little more courage, strengthening
the core of her heart. Even if her heart was broken, she would not be
despised, but always loved. The existence of her sister, whom she could
believe in, was the most important charm for Lazura.

She repeated the love ritual, offering her sister's pain as a sacrifice.
As long as she did, Lazura would surely endure.

“We’ll be busy tomorrow, so be prepared. After you wake up and eat,
we’ll have shoulder rubs and a massage…then, to make your nee-san happy,
let’s play a game where it’s a close contest. Of course, if I get bored
and sleepy, you’ll also keep me company for a nap.”

“…Yes.”

“If you understand, rest today. Is that alright?”

Smiling at Berry, who lowered her eyes and said “yes,” Lazura slipped
into bed.  
And inviting her in, she gently embraced her and closed her eyes.

Two days later, she wore a one-piece dress. Hand in hand, the two of
them walked through the castle town. The world in the sunlight, which
she felt for the first time in a long time, seemed bright and shining.  
Selkute, where they lived, was not a large city like Garugain, but it
was not a small town either. There were many people, it was lively, and
relatively prosperous. But the liveliness of the royal capital was
incomparable, and if you went from the first-class city streets filled
with nobles and the wealthy to the castle town, the sheer number of
people was overwhelming.

Even her sister, who hadn't changed her expression since coming here,
widened her eyes just a little.  
Even back then, she had only been as far as the garden of their mansion.
Berry, who had never even been to town, must have been quite surprised.
She had lived without even knowing that there were so many people in the
world, and that the world was so vast.  
Just like with the dress, Lazura thought she should have taken her
sister to town sooner, even forcibly.  
She had no regrets about herself, but only regrets about her sister.

It was common for them to quietly spend their time in their room. But
Berry had an unusually strong curiosity and a vivid imagination. If the
world expanded, she might have been stimulated by various things, and
her feelings might have naturally turned outward.  
Her dark, sunken light brown eyes shone brightly today.  
It had been a long time since she had seen her sister’s eyes like that.

The sun was high, illuminating the whole world. The voices of people
chattering about something were as cheerful as they were annoying.  
The same world, the same place, yet it also seemed like a world far
away.

A sense of alienation drowned out the sound, and she felt lonely. The
hand that grasped that heart gently enveloped Lazura.  
The color reflected in her sister's eyes, and the color Lazura now
possessed were the same.  
In the sunlight, yet as if looking at the bright world from the
shadows—a dark shadow in that brilliance.

Her sister's eyes were like the magical eyes of a fairy tale, casting a
spell just by looking into them. They cast shadows on the bright world
and held light in the dark world.  
Her twilight eyes, which were neither one nor the other, bewildered and
entangled people, and then gently enveloped them. They possessed such a
strange power.

She might be cruelly treated and killed. But she could believe that her
sister would be alright, because she had such magical eyes. Even the
prince with those dark eyes might be entangled and enveloped by those
eyes.  
Because her sister, who showed shadows in the world full of light, shone
in the deepest darkness.

“…?”

“No, it’s nothing. What do you think of the town?”

“…There are many people.”

Lazura chuckled at her sister, who spoke as she saw.  
Probably, she was thinking about various things in her head.  
Her gaze shifted subtly to the left and right, looking at the
surrounding people and shops.

There can be as many happy memories as possible. No matter what happens
in the future, when she looks back, she will be able to think, “It was
good.”  
She wanted to make sure there were no regrets, so she looked around at
the bright world.

The royal capital is vast. It would be impossible to see everything in
one day.  
She wanted to go around various places during the holiday and create
happy memories.  
If she could even once see her sister smile during that time, it would
be the best.  
Making memories through such play.

“I’m a little hungry, so let’s buy something from a street
vendor…fufufu, it would be nice to just eat as we walk. It’s unrefined,
but I’ve always wanted to try it. Will you keep me company?”

“…Yes, nee-san.”

There was no need to worry about the eyes of those around her anymore.  
She thought she should do everything she wanted to do during this
opportunity.

“Even in the royal capital, you can’t find good goods. They’re just
expensive with excessive decoration.”

“Where did you hear that…it seems that Korze has taken over the family
business and is now a blacksmith.  
When we go back, it wouldn't be bad to visit him…”

Suddenly, her breath stopped at the sound she heard, and she stopped.
And diagonally in front of her, walking in a way that seemed like they
were passing by—a familiar young man looked at her and widened his eyes.

“…Lazura?”

“…”

“Why are you in the royal capital…”

Bogan looked at Berry next to her, frowned at the fact that there were
no other attendants.

“Bogan-sama, this is…?”

“She is the daughter of the Argan family, someone I’ve known since my
grandfather's generation.”

The handsome young man with reddish-brown hair—Nozan answered.  
A familiar voice. Compared to the last time she saw him, he was even
more sharp, and his face bore faint scars. But at a glance, if you heard
his voice, you would know clearly.

“And that is your sister…?”

“…Yes, this is Berry.”

“She’s a beautiful ojou-sama, resembling your mother and older sister. I
am Bogan Christand…your father and older sister know me. You don’t need
to be wary.”

Berry, who quietly answered, “Yes,” grasped Lazura’s hand tightly.  
Unknowingly, Lazura's hand was also tense. Her voice was almost
high-pitched, and the question of “why?” filled her head.

She had heard that the war was over.  
He must have achieved some kind of military merit and was called to the
royal capital because of it. She wondered if he was safe after the war
ended, but she tried not to think about it too much. Because there would
probably be no more chances to meet.

“…I’m sorry.  
I have, um, something to do, so…”

— \*I don’t want to be known\*, she thought.  
Pulling Berry’s hand, she was about to walk away when her hand was
suddenly grabbed.

“…”

“…Did something happen to your father?”

“U-um…my hand—”

“—Lazura”

Looking into his eyes, her gaze darted around. She felt her voice
faltering, her face contorting, and she couldn't hold back.

“Lazura…”

Tears welled up like a child’s, overflowing uncontrollably. Letting go
of the hand she was holding, she was held by the hand that had grabbed
hers, and Lazura's head, which covered her face, was embraced by large
hands.

“Calm down a little…and then tell me what happened. …I’m on your side.”

Her voice continued to sob, her breathing was ragged. Unknowingly, both
of her hands creased his jacket, clinging to it as if clinging to a life
raft.  
Her voice became unintelligible, she couldn’t nod, and she soiled his
chest with tears.

“…Nozan, I’m sorry, but—”

“First, let’s find a place to calm down. Please wait a moment.”

“Berry, are you alright?”

“…Yes.”

How did her sister see her sister's appearance?

Perhaps, it was a terrible betrayal.
