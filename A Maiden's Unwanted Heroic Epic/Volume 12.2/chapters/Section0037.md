# Chapter 347 - Charm 6

Bogan, like the king's younger brother, apparently came directly to the
capital from the battlefield for the victory celebration.  
After hearing the story, he said he wanted to handle everything himself,
and he took care of everything within a few days. He came to pick up
Lazura and Berry, who were waiting anxiously at the inn, and then they
all went by carriage.  
They talked again inside the carriage.

“—I’ve settled the Argan family's debt.”

“That…”

“Don’t worry about it. You may not know this, but… I’ve worked quite
hard on the battlefield since then. Now I’m a corps commander… I’ve
received an earldom and have been entrusted with the northern army as
the acting Northern General.  
‘Acting’ is just a matter of age… if I continue to work without making
any major mistakes, I will eventually be appointed Northern General and
receive a title as a border count.”

Their eyes widened, and Bogan, sitting opposite in the carriage, smiled.

“I’ve also been assigned a prosperous administrative territory. There
might be some difficulties for a while… but getting used to life on the
battlefield, a roof and a bed are enough. I don’t want to rely on
others, but I also have subordinates who offered assistance after
hearing my circumstances. So, please leave it to me without worry.”

“But, that much…”

“I hear that the Argan family received many favors from the first head
of the family… my grandfather’s generation. That’s part of the reason,
and both my father and I were taken care of by your father. Your father
and grandfather wouldn't overlook you spending time in such a place… and
neither would I.”

She nodded, reassured.  
His voice and eyes were endlessly kind.

“My mother passed away while I was at the front, and I let the servants
go. I'm alone at the Garugain mansion. That’s why I came straight from
the battlefield to the capital… I find it more calming to have a couple
of guests than to be alone.”

Then Bogan turned to Berry.

“I don't intend to do anything to you or your older sister. Just please
trust me?”

“…Yes.”

Berry, who had been looking at Bogan with somewhat cold eyes, answered
quietly, and Lazura gently stroked her head.  
She thought Berry was wary.  
It was probably due to the kind of days she had been spending.

Lazura’s chest was full of relief and unexpected joy, and she didn't
have the leeway to worry about her sister. She was unable to sense her
sister's feelings of betrayal by her older sister.

“I’m sorry that the mansion doesn’t have any servants… but please rest
at the mansion for a while. I will return to the capital once I’ve taken
care of some business to attend the victory celebration.  
Let's talk about what to do next when I get back.”

“…Understood.”

“Then, see you later.”

He got out of the carriage and mounted his horse. Lazura simply wept
with relief and joy, hugging Berry.

After the war, news of Bogan's achievements had apparently reached
Garugain, and the city gardeners had voluntarily taken care of the
garden, but of course, with no master or servants, they couldn't enter
the house.  
The mansion, which had been left unattended for a long time, was covered
in dust and was in terrible condition.  
Nozan returned with them, bringing several helpful servants from his
house, and they all cleaned together.

Bogan, picking up a rag himself, saying it was a good change of pace,
watched as Lazura and Berry helped with the cleaning—and that evening,
after cleaning the mansion…

Several of the paintings and other furnishings had been sold in the
capital, so the mansion was sparsely furnished.  
Imagining her somewhat sad face, Berry couldn't sleep, and she got out
of bed to express her gratitude to Bogan. He wasn’t in his private room;
he was in the drawing-room.

A magnificent sword was displayed above the fireplace. The Christand
family has a short history, and they hardly have anything that could be
called a treasure. The only family heirloom was a long sword that his
grandfather—the first head of the family—had taken from his enemy. She
had heard that story from him before.  
He had laughed about having a similar experience, when Lazura had been
sulking after being scolded for misbehaving.

Apparently, he had drawn his family heirloom sword and swung it
playfully, only to have his father confiscate it and beat him.  
His father said it was absolutely unforgivable to treat the sword of a
noble warrior as a toy.  
Bogan had sulked, wondering why he had to be beaten, but later, his
grandfather, having heard the story, had said with a laugh: “You nearly
got a bloody nose! Your father scolded you so harshly because he was
worried that overlooking your careless play would have a negative impact
on your future.  
But, if you still think his scolding was truly unjust when we next meet,
tell me then. As a fellow nobleman and your ally, I’ll warn your father
that his scolding was excessive.”

Bogan didn’t blame Lazura, but he said this in a serious tone.  
Being told that he would stand up for her as an ally, she couldn’t
stubbornly hold onto her pride.  
If his stern father, who was the head of another family, found out that
his child had been warned, it would cause a major issue.  
Lazura hesitated, saying that she shouldn't go that far, but he said
solemnly that he had to be an ally if she genuinely felt that she had
been treated unjustly, and he forced her to admit that she had also been
in the wrong. This important family heirloom sword appeared in that
little reminiscence.

In the drawing-room, lit only by the moonlight, Bogan stood quietly,
gazing at the sword in both hands.

“Um, Bogan-sama… that sword…”

“It’s a fine sword. There is some damage to the blade, but it would
fetch a good price.”

“But, that’s… the Christand family’s…”

“Don’t worry about it. …Apart from the reward from His Majesty, I can’t
just sell treasures or newly bestowed swords. I want to settle the
payment cleanly and in one go with those fellows, and borrowing from
Nozan is a last resort… besides, things are just things.”

The weight behind the words, “Things are just things,” squeezed her
heart.  
It certainly didn't feel like something she could just think that way
about.

She didn't think there was any need to pay in one lump sum. The
Christand family, having been given a prosperous administrative
territory, could have easily paid even with interest, and she didn't
think Roland would have charged Bogan, who would be heading the northern
army, exorbitant interest.  
Still, the reason he insisted on a lump sum payment was for Lazura and
Berry's sake. It was an act of consideration, so that she wouldn't have
to remember it every time she made a payment, so that it would be over,
so that they could start a new life.

“My grandfather defeated the corps commander of Elsren. He raided the
camp, but our corps commander was also killed, and a chaotic battle
ensued, but we had the advantage in terms of situation and numbers. They
say he was a terrifying warrior who wielded a large spear with ease, but
even his stamina wasn't infinite. One by one, his strong guards fell,
and he was surrounded… but even when he was alone, he fought.”

He said that the battlefield was a strange place.

“If he used a bow, he could have killed him without any sacrifice. But
everyone present showed genuine respect towards him. It might seem
foolish, but he wielded his sword, declared his name, challenged others,
and defeated many—my grandfather, a centurion, also challenged him in
this way.”

He gazed at the steel, closing his eyes.

“A man's body has its limits… he could only stand by sheer willpower. It
seemed that he would die if it was prolonged, but my grandfather thought
that there shouldn’t be any underhanded tactics, so he attacked head-on…
sacrificing his left arm, he closed the distance and tried to push him
down, but he was like a rock.  
The man endured and dropped his spear, drawing this sword. My
grandfather, though aware of his own death, launched a desperate blow…
but before the warrior's fatal blow could land, my grandfather's blade
struck first.”

Bogan sheathed the sword. He carefully placed it back on the
mantelpiece.

“…He said, laughing, ‘I’ve received your parting gift; you can keep the
reward.’ Then, this sword became the sword of a great warrior, a family
heirloom of the Christand family… but my grandfather told me when I came
of age that the sword itself has no meaning.”

“Meaning…”

“What I truly received wasn’t the sword, but the name and pride of that
warrior. The sword is merely a tool to remember, to not forget that.  
What’s important is within one’s heart; any object is merely a mirror to
reflect oneself.”

Turning to Lazura, he smiled and said:

“I believe that’s right, and that’s all I do. Grandfather wouldn't have
been stingy with things. And the name and pride of my grandfather… I
won't forget his teachings, even without a mirror. Yes, I vowed that
just now. I said not to worry, but you probably still will… it's not a
big deal.”

“But…”

As Lazura looked down, Bogan quietly continued:

“Just focus on the future. That's enough.”

“…The future, you mean…”

“The fact that I paid off the Argan family's debt… you can’t possibly
feel that we’re on equal footing. You’ll want to repay the favor, and
for example, if I were to ask you… to be my wife now, you wouldn’t have
the chance to consider.”

He looked slightly embarrassed and said he hated that kind of
relationship.

“We’ve known each other for a long time… but time-wise it’s short, and
it's been a long time since we last met. Honestly, I can’t say I love
you as a woman, and you don’t know enough about me to want to spend your
life with me. …So for now, please be my guest until this matter becomes
a thing of the past for you… then, I want you to decide what you want to
do from now on.”

She really admired him as she had always imagined. Even after becoming a
distinguished warrior, he remained the same as when she had seen him as
a child.

“Is… is it alright if it’s me?  
I… that…”

Her body wasn't as beautiful as before, and she felt mismatched with
him, who was now a distinguished warrior. If he were to take her as his
wife, he would surely hear words he didn't need to hear and see things
he didn't need to see. Everyone in the north knew what had happened to
the Argan family, and in the capital, many knew that she had sold
flowers.

“You are more beautiful than anyone. As a noblewoman, and as an older
sister… you simply fulfilled and upheld your responsibilities. That
nobility cannot be tarnished no matter what, and no matter what anyone
says, I respect you. …If I were to take a wife, you would be the best
woman, but precisely because of that, if I were to take you as my wife,
I want to build a new relationship without any unnecessary
circumstances.”

He asked her what she thought.  
Wiping her eyes, she nodded.

“If… if it’s alright with you…”

“Then it’s good. The past is the past… remembering is enough. Let’s talk
about the future from now on.  
If we can ever truly do that… I want to talk to you again.”

Bogan smiled and touched her head.  
Lazura smiled quietly and leaned on him slightly.

“You must be very tired after the long journey and helping with the big
cleaning. It’s late, get some rest.”

Nodding, she thanked him and went to her room.  
Her sister, who was supposed to be asleep in her bed, was not there; the
balcony door was open.

A slightly cold air.  
The night sky was beautiful, the stars twinkled, and a perfectly round
moon lit the world.  
The girl turned her back, her hand shading her eyes.  
The wind blew through her long hair, and her thin negligee fluttered
gently.  
Her red hair blended into the night blue, shining as if translucent in
the moonlight.

“It’s beautiful.”

She was speaking either to the night sky or to her sister. She simply
smiled, saying it was like a painting.

“…Yes. But I can’t reach it.”

Berry said this quietly, and Bogan chuckled.

“It feels like I’ve heard something childish from you for the first time
in a while.”

It was a truly beautiful sky.  
She narrowed her eyelids in the slightly cool night air, thinking it
felt like a different world.  
Come to think of it, she hadn’t looked up at the night sky lately.  
Going next to her, she touched the railing and looked up at the sky, the
same as her.

“He’s a wonderful person.”

“…Were you listening?”

“A little.”

Slowly lowering her hand which was raised to the moon.

“…I think he’s perfect for nee-san.”

A voice that seemed to melt into the stillness of the night.  
Blushing, Lazura looked at Berry, who had a faint smile on her lips.  
Her eyes no longer held hatred, clear like transparent amber, shining
quietly in the moonlight.

“It’s the first time I’ve seen you smile properly in a while.”

Reaching out her hand, Berry gently pressed her cheek against her
hand.  
She narrowed her light brown eyes under her long eyelashes, gently
placing her hand on Lazura’s hand and slowly closing her eyelids.

“This happiness is something you gave me, Berry… I think so.”

Tracing her soft lips with her thumb, she said:

“…Will you stay by my side from now on?”

Berry, opening her eyes again, took Lazura’s hand:

“As long as nee-san needs me.”

Kissing the back of her hand.  
She offered it with a respectful and elegant gesture.

She thought it was a sign of gentle farewell. The most distant kiss was
forgiveness for the sister who had broken the contract.

—The next day, Berry cut off her long hair and bowed before Bogan.

“I may be immature and lack skills. But… if you would be so kind… please
keep me here as a servant.”

“…It will take some time before we hire servants. I’m certainly glad
that you’re willing to do the housework in the meantime… but I intend to
welcome you both as guests. You are still young, and I hear you’re not
strong. I understand how you feel, but don’t push yourself…”

“Please. …As a noblewoman, I beg you.”

Seeing Bogan’s troubled expression, Lazura nodded.  
Her beautiful hair, which she had carefully maintained, was gone, and
Lazura, who had been carefree, finally understood that she had deeply
hurt her sister.

She rejected her pride and her desperate love, and chose happiness.  
The two separated parts would surely never become one again.  
And she wouldn't want it to ever happen again.

Still, they were sisters.  
The one who placed such a curse on her sister was none other than
Lazura.

Forever separated, yet cruelly close, yet never parting.

Berry clearly drew a line and didn’t cross it again.  
Lazura merely said, “What a waste,” and Berry replied, “It’s in the way
of my work,” and that was the end of it.  
It could be seen as a rebuke to a traitor. But Lazura thought otherwise.

What Berry abandoned along with her long hair was her own happiness.  
She had simply let go of the brilliance she had longed for in that dark
world, so that she would never desire it again.  
Unlike Lazura, who had been welcomed back into the bright sunlight,
Berry remained in the twilight.

The clinging gaze disappeared, and her steps became light. It had been a
burden, but without it, her spirit would have broken. However, in a
happy world, her sister’s love was too heavy, making her feel
suffocated.  
She thought it was indeed forgiveness for Lazura.

There was surely a form of happiness like that of a mother and
daughter-in-law, spending time with one person, and considering the
circumstances, it was natural.  
She even thought about suggesting it when she grew up, but she didn't in
the end.

“You’ve grown quite tall. Don’t your heels hurt?”

“A little… but it’s not a big deal.”

Two years after coming to Garugain—Lazura's room.  
Berry, sipping tea, seemed as if the time that had been completely
stopped since she left the mansion had finally started moving again.  
She had grown taller, and her body was a little more curvaceous.  
She had some days when she felt unwell, but recently, she hadn't been
bedridden.  
Except when sleeping, she wore an apron dress all day and night.  
She felt it was inappropriate for a child, but somehow, it looked
strangely good on Berry.  
If Lazura from the same age wore it, it certainly wouldn’t have looked
like that.

Lazura initially helped her sister with various tasks, but lately has
been gently told to avoid interfering, leaving her entirely in charge of
the household.  
She's also benefited from the books on body augmentation that Bogan
recommended, learning a great deal. It's like giving a club to a giant.
Her sister, who she thought was one person, is practically omnipresent;
Berry, who she thought was in the kitchen, might be in the orchard, or
hanging laundry. In the mornings, the house is mysteriously lit, and at
night the lights turn off by themselves.  
The sudden darkness in the middle of the night nearly gave her a heart
attack.

“If you’re feeling unwell, tell me. You’re growing up into an adult. I
felt under the weather around your age… Don’t overexert yourself.”

“…Yes.”

Lazura is five feet one inch tall.  
She was a little short, but at this rate, her sister would soon surpass
her.  
Their mother was also petite, while their stepmother was taller and more
curvaceous.  
She's sure to become a stunning beauty.  
For now, she can genuinely rejoice in her sister's blossoming beauty.

“Heh heh, at this rate, I’ll be looking up to you. If you, my little
sister, try to pat my head, I’ll be furious. That’s a privilege reserved
for superiors.”

“You might be my inferior then…”

“…Don’t quibble.”

“He he, I’ll become like you, nee-san.”

A beautiful smile.  
She playfully tugs at her smooth cheeks, glaring, before bursting into
laughter herself.

“You’re such a rude child. Was my upbringing lacking?”

“I haven’t had the opportunity to observe a model of etiquette… I’m
sorry. I’ll study from now on.”

“I’ll pull even harder, so much so that you won’t recover!”

“That would be quite problematic.”

Quiet chuckles, a gentle shaking of shoulders. Berry still doesn’t open
up to others. But when they’re alone, they can joke around, like
ordinary, close sisters.  
A normal relationship. The future Lazura had longed for, a happiness she
hopes will last forever. A wonderful, ideal relationship.

However, it was built upon an invisible, paper-thin wall between them.

That sister conformed to the image the older sister desired.  
The heavy, clinging, entwining love, the kind that would engulf you if
you touched it, was on the other side of that boundary.  
Her cheeks were smooth—she could no longer sense the inner self, as
before.

With just a little push, she could clearly see beyond the wall.  
But unless she does, her sister will not allow a glimpse of the other
side.  
But Lazura won't cross that line.  
And Berry, surely, would not forgive her this time.

Their happiness exists because they both maintain this boundary.  
She didn’t think her sister was unhappy, but she felt she wasn't
fulfilled either. She thought her sister would leave, searching for a
reason to escape.  
To dislike this possibility is, perhaps, Lazura’s selfishness.

Just beyond that thin wall, she senses a heavy presence.  
Lazura herself clings to her sister’s possessive love, unable to let go.
In that time when she was sustained by her sister’s love, they melted
together, fused. A part of Lazura became Berry, and a part of Berry
became her sister.

They were perhaps too close, too intimate.  
That’s why they must maintain a distance, even as close sisters,
questioning whether the affection they share is truly sisterly
affection, scrutinizing it.  
Even simply touching each other requires caution.

It would be so much easier if they could simply distance themselves;
they both secretly wished this. But they love each other too much, and
find it too hard to separate. Yet, the sister tries to leave, while the
older sister doesn't want that.

If pursued, they distance themselves; if distanced, they pursue.  
They choose to live at this paper-thin distance from each other.

It would be good if someone who loved her sister more than Lazura
appeared someday. But unless that happens, she wouldn't be able to let
her sister go.

The overwhelming affection was comfortable and precious.

“Berry, your older sister is sleepy. Become a stuffed animal.”

“…Nee-san, um, I still have things to do.”

“You’re still half-baked as a servant, Berry. Do you think a servant has
things that take precedence over their master's commands?”

“Perhaps you should say that after you're formally married? I am, after
all, the head of the household's servant, and you are still a guest… I
mean…”

Lazura lifts Berry, sits her on the bed, and removes her shoes.

“It’s almost the wedding, so it’s fine. If you say so, then it's an
order from your guest and sister, Berry. Don’t quibble.”

“It seems you're the one quibbling, nee-san…”

“Will you obey? Or disobey?”

Sighing, Berry gets into bed, and Lazura smiles and strokes her cheek.
Then she gently strokes her lips with her thumb and says:

“A charm to prevent complaints. See, Berry, you’re gradually turning
into a stuffed animal.”

Berry looks at Lazura, wanting to complain, then relaxes.

“Don’t try to win arguments with your older sister, Berry. Whether you
are right or wrong is inconsequential to your nee-san. I’ll do what I
want.”

“…Don’t you find your own words embarrassing?”

“Of course not. Bogan said it himself. In battle, winning is all that
matters. Remember that, as a servant of the Christand household. …See,
stuffed animals don’t complain.”

She orders her sister not to sigh, as she hugs her.  
Her sister snuggles close, in a sweet surrender. Lazura strokes her
light hair; it's not long enough to require her care anymore.

If she wished for them to be wives of wonderful men together, her sister
would have accepted.  
But a brilliant man would surely not reach out to her sister's
darkness.  
He wouldn’t have her weakness, and he wouldn't be charmed by it.  
Her sister, like herself, cannot be fulfilled without self-sacrificing
love.

And Lazura wasn't capable of accepting her sister's love completely. Yet
she still wished for her to be her sister, to be loved by her.

“I love you, Berry.”

A charm for her sister.  
A small curse repeated.  
Even knowing, without realizing it, she says:

“…Yes, nee-san.”

She checks the presence of love beyond the thin wall.

Love is a curse and an obsession.  
For Lazura, and for her sister.  
It casts light on the darkness, overshadowing the light.  
It's so bothersome, this growing love, this clinging obsession. For
Lazura, at least, sisterly love is like this, and probably for Berry,
too.

She feels true happiness in Bogan's radiant love, and utter peace in
Berry's love in the shadows.  
She, who received everything as her due, is undoubtedly a selfish and
deceitful person.  
She is neither as noble as Bogan believes nor as beautiful as Berry
thinks.  
But because she is as she is, Lazura casts a spell on her sister.

“You are my treasure.”

Even if eternally separated, she would be cruelly close, never letting
her go. Driven by obsession, she says:

“…Good night, Berry.”

Whispering with a mixture of love, she closes her eyes.  
If only she could have a wonderful encounter that would awaken her from
this dream.

Half curse, half prayer.  
Lazura alone cannot fulfill a single wish.
