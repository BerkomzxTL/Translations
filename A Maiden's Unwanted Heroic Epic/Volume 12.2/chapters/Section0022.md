—--

There wasn't a single day I didn't vomit.  
Every morning, I was woken at sunrise and forced to put on full armor.  
A sandbag was strapped to my back, and we were made to run.  
Since I'd been there from the very beginning, I was one of the luckier
ones.  
New recruits usually threw up at this stage.

Next was a full-speed sprint of twenty ken.  
The fastest person would drop out and be allowed a rest, but everyone
else continued, repeating the sprint until someone took first place.  
The more people there were, the more times we had to run, delaying
breakfast, but the rule was that everyone had to take first place.  
If someone couldn't run anymore, someone else had to carry them to the
finish line; otherwise, breakfast would never come.

After the meal, came endless stretching.  
Luckily, after I'd been there for a while, I stopped vomiting after
meals.  
Initially, there was a post-meal run intended for digestion, but after
witnessing the members vomiting after eating, Christand-sama, the
founder of this unit…

'Honestly, what do you think food is?  
From fieldwork to cooking, you should consider the feelings of those who
prepared this meal!'

…with Krische Christand's blessed lecture, it was abolished.  
Does she think even one person in this world enjoys vomiting after
meals?  
Everyone present felt murderous intent.

The stretching was excruciatingly long.  
It didn't matter if you were young or older.  
Our legs were spread until they ached, and we were forced to stretch our
entire bodies.  
Completely exhausted from the morning run, a break for a meal, and then
stretching.  
By the time it was over, we were usually so fatigued and our muscles
were so relaxed that we couldn't lift our limbs.  
Only then did we move on to sword practice.

Downswings, upswings, thrusts, upward slashes – we did fifty repetitions
of various combinations.  
Around this point, even the veterans were starting to lose their
minds.  
The cloth wrapped tightly around the sword blades, ostensibly to prevent
injuries if the sword slipped from our hands, was incredibly heavy.  
We were at the peak of exhaustion; people fainted every day.

It was around this time that a girl would arrive for an inspection.  
Watching us, barely breathing, wielding swords like corpses, she didn't
show pity, but ate cookies with a carefree expression.

'Hmm, they're learning slower than I thought.  
Dagra, perhaps we should add more weight to the swords and limbs?'

And then, those words.  
It was beyond anger.

'Y-yes, b-but… increasing the weight might injure more people…'

'Hmm… Krische wants to move on to the next stage quickly.  
It seems that many still rely too much on muscle; Krische think it would
be better to push them to the point of near collapse.  
If they get proper food and rest, they probably won't die.'

'Yes, understood…'

'Also, prevent desertions.  
Krische would be too embarrassed to face the head of the family if her
unit produced deserters during this crucial time for gathering
soldiers.'

Suppressing a yawn, she only spoke and left.  
Who was it that called her a mad rabbit?  
Her charming appearance was in stark contrast to her nature.  
Her treatment was devoid of compassion, her purple eyes regarding us
like insects.  
Few, if any, held any affection for her at the time.

A great noble, a terrible noble lady who used her parents' power to
issue orders.  
That was the girl, Krische Christand. The unit members were of commoner
birth. And commoners already held distrust towards the nobility.  
While the hero Christand was known for his integrity, her behavior was
the embodiment of the negative rumors about nobles – an arrogant being
who didn't consider commoners as humans.

We had heard she was an adopted daughter, which made her treatment of us
even more infuriating.  
Just because she happened to be picked up by a general's family, why
could she inflict such suffering on fellow commoners?  
Everyone undoubtedly harbored resentment and murderous intent towards
her.

Conversely, we felt a degree of sympathy for Dagra, who directly gave us
the harsh orders, because we knew he couldn't defy that girl.  
We even felt a kinship with him.  
Dagra was a strict training instructor, but we saw how he tried to
protect us from the girl's orders, which inspired near murderous intent,
and many of us knew how he worked tirelessly to ensure we got proper
rest.  
Therefore, we couldn't bring ourselves to resent Dagra.

Thoughtful older members like Kiriku suspected at the time that her
cruel behavior wasn't unintentional.  
He thought she was deliberately making us hate her so that we wouldn't
direct our animosity toward Dagra, our direct instructor.

However, that was overanalyzing.  
Knowing her later, what we saw and felt was mostly true.

Krische could be considered fundamentally kind, but she was also utterly
ruthless.  
She probably didn't care about us at all back then; a few deaths during
training wouldn't have bothered her much.  
The training was undeniably merciless.

The situation at the time – the sudden civil war between the princess
and the prince – was a factor. There wasn't enough time, and it was
crash course training.  
It was incredibly inconsiderate; the princess's whim. Compared to those
who underwent crash training in the 'Hundred Black Unit,' those trained
in the 'Black Flag Special Ops' were quite fortunate.

We didn't know what we were being made to do or why we were being
treated this way. We were simply made to run, swing swords, carry
barrels – subjected to hellish training.  
The fortunate thing was that we were so exhausted our brains barely
functioned, leaving no room for questioning.  
Despite being hungry, we ate like corpses and every night, while rolling
in bed, I tried to escape, but muscle aches and fatigue made me fall
asleep before I could act.

"...?"

It was around two weeks into the training, as far as I can remember. In
teams of five, we were made to carry incredibly heavy barrels in the
late afternoon, before dinner.  
They were far too heavy to carry alone; each squad had at least two. In
our squad, the two who lost in stone fist carried them, while the other
three supported them from behind, forcing us to walk around the Berger's
fortress.

Losing in stone fist and dreading the barrel-carrying duty that day,
what I found strange was how light it was.  
It was the kind of thing I wouldn't be able to carry even ten ken, let
alone half a ri, alone – I felt the usual weight on my back and the
soles of my feet, but I didn't feel the pressure of being crushed by the
barrel. I thought maybe it was just a lighter barrel, but the people who
carried it seemed normal.  
I tilted my head, but pretended to strain as usual while moving the
barrel.

I was already exhausted. Just walking was nearly killing me, and if I
were to be found out that the barrel was light, I might have to redo it.

I got through it, pretending, and forgot my doubts as I immediately fell
asleep, but I found something else strange the next day. While swinging
the heavy, cloth-wrapped sword, I felt a strange lightness. My body was
as tired as usual, but it felt as light as swinging a wooden sword or
even a branch.  
However, I felt its weight in my palm, and the momentum of swinging it
made my body sway. I initially thought I'd simply gotten better at using
the sword, but I had been a gambling den bodyguard. I was someone who
had wielded swords quite a bit, not an amateur.  
I didn't think I had improved that dramatically.

"What's wrong, Koza? Tired?"

"No, nothing, Instructor Dagra…!"

I hastily replied and swung my sword normally, tilting my head. Though I
was pretending to be tired, I felt more energy left than usual even
after finishing the sword practice. On two consecutive days, I lost in
stone fist and carried the barrels, yet felt the same strange lightness
and even found myself able to look around.

While carrying this murderous barrel, you wouldn't have the energy to
look around.  
It's normal to look down while walking. But, I noticed a few others,
who, while breathing heavily, looked around – pretending as if they were
carrying something very heavy.

I didn't think Dagra would have made the barrels lighter.  
That's when my suspicions took definite shape.

I knew that there are people in this world who could be called
superhuman. The world is vast – even in the Black Training Unit, I had
seen several people whose body control I couldn't fathom. People who
could easily run twenty ken while I was running at full speed for ten
ken.

When I was in the countryside, I once saw a powerfully built man who
could throw a large man with one hand.  
The training unit had a lot of people like that. Mia stood out in
particular. She had an adorable face but was incredibly strong; in races
(later she fell to the bottom ranks) she was among the top-tier
superhuman group.  
It was already strange how her physique could endure such hellish
training that made even grown men give up.  
While carrying barrels, she complained about how heavy and painful they
were, yet walked calmly once she started carrying them.

"What's up, Koza?  
Mia and I are tired of being hit on… do you want to be kicked in the
groin like a bug?"

"Don't glare at me.  
I'm not as stupid as that guy. I just have something I want to ask Mia…
no, you'll do.  
I won't bother you while you eat, and I'll leave as soon as we're done."

Mia was always by Kahlua's side.  
Besides being incredibly strong and fast, she was a country girl from a
rural village.  
Since those around her were thugs, Kahlua was probably her only reliable
support in that environment.

Even at mealtimes, they sat away from everyone else.  
Kahlua, accustomed to rough things, wouldn't hesitate to use force
against anyone who approached carelessly, and she had once beaten up the
ringleader, Bug.  
Most wouldn't approach them.  
We were too tired to have such courage, but it was also true that even
Koza, a former bodyguard, would feel a chill down his spine when Kahlua
glared at him with cold eyes.  
You could tell she had been through many battles just by looking at her
eyes.

"You want to ask me…?"

"Yeah.  
Your speed aside… you're incredibly strong. I wondered if something was
going on."

"I-incredibly strong…"

"It's a fact.  
You don't look strong at all; you don't look like someone who can carry
those barrels.  
It's a barrel that even muscle-bound guys like Dols carry with bulging
veins.  
…I wondered if there was some reason other than muscles, and if this
training was to allow us to use whatever that reason is."

Kahlua responded with an impressed "Hmm."  
Mia's eyes darted around nervously.

"If you look like that, I’m probably not far off… You probably know
something.  
The instructor often talks to you; it's not just because you're a woman,
right?"

"That sounds like you're sure.  
You're aware of this 'something other than muscle'?"

"Wa-wait, Kahlua…!"

"Mia shows it on her face, and she can't hide it.  
Given that it's something that should be kept secret, you should be able
to tell someone who came to ask directly.  
Quite a few have realized by now."

"T-that might be true…"

Seeing Mia's troubled face, Kahlua looked exasperated.  
She asked with her eyes, "So?" and I replied,

"I've felt an unusual lightness in my body since yesterday.  
I noticed something was wrong during today's training, and that's why I
came to you two, because you seemed to know something. Was my guess
right?"

"More or less. This training is to teach you how to use that power… the
construction of virtual muscles through magic, they call it body
expansion."

"Body expansion… Magic… like that stuff in magical tools? Like constant
magic lamps?"

"Yeah.  
This unit is made up of people who have the aptitude to control it.  
That's why there's someone short like Mia…apparently, she was able to
use it from the very beginning."

Mia's eyes darted around.

"Basically, it's inherited through bloodline, mostly among nobles.  
But, apparently, some people are born with this constitution
unexpectedly, and that rabbit girl seems to be selecting people who can
do that."

"So that's it.  
I understand."

"It seems that if you rely too much on muscle, you won't be able to use
it properly. This stupid training is simply to exhaust the body… I was
lucky to get the hang of it quickly. I had some kind of unconscious
feeling about it."

Kahlua was among the superhuman group – those people probably could use
it from the start.

"Also, this is a dirty thing, but wasn't your urination less frequent
compared to the others?  
It seems that individual differences are pretty significant until you
can use magic to a certain extent, but mine became less frequent when I
was fairly young, and so did Mia's."

"Is that magic, too?"

"It seems so. It seems that unnecessary things in the body are converted
into magic… maybe unknowingly, this magic converts and perfects the
body."

That made me think back.  
I'd always urinated less than others, but since I came here, I'd only
urinated two or three times at the beginning.  
I'd never had a bowel movement.  
Some guys complained that they didn't even urinate because they sweated
too much, and I rarely saw anyone go to relieve themselves.

"And see, everyone in this unit is younger than their age, right?"

"…? Yeah."

"Same with nobles.  
Apparently, aging is slower."

Once she explained it, it made sense.  
Nobles live much longer than commoners.  
I had heard that it wasn't just because they ate well, but because of
their blood itself, and I had heard about this magic thing once or twice
at the bar.

However, it was irrelevant to me. I thought it was enviable, but I
didn't expect that story to connect with my present situation.

"Once you can move your body using magic, you can exert far greater
strength than just using muscles, and you'll be less fatigued. Once you
learn, it's just a matter of getting used to it… if you concentrate on
the feeling instead of your muscles, you'll probably be able to move
around like Mia soon enough."

"Got it.  
Thanks."

"Well, I think the captain will tell you in a few days.  
It seems they move to the next stage when about half the people have
realized… I think about a third have figured it out."

Three days later, as Kahlua had said, the captain gathered us in a
warehouse. The purpose of the unit was revealed for the first time – a
special light infantry unit composed solely of magic users – and there
was an explanation of magic and body expansion. Those who couldn't use
it were surprised, but those who, like me, had already figured it out
and hid it, nodded in agreement.

Training wouldn't change much for the future, but instructions were
given for those who had learned to support those who hadn't.  
Apparently, squads where everyone could use magic would receive a small
reward depending on their ranking.

Before, the failing squads would bear the burden of the failures of
other squads.  
But, the focus shifted to rewards rather than punishments, which began
then. It was the end of the time of sheer suffering, and everyone was
overjoyed.  
It might just be a carrot-and-stick approach, but it's surprisingly
effective. For those involved, the reward came after extreme mental and
physical exhaustion. Since it was a holiday that day, everyone was
energized the next day.

Looking back now, it wasn't a huge amount of money, but soldiers were
mostly living hand-to-mouth.  
It was a reward separate from their salary, just a few silver coins, but
they were overjoyed.  
I was no exception, and I instructed my squad mates as a senior who had
learned to use magic.

Among those who clearly learned to manipulate magical power, I was
relatively behind, but perhaps my struggles made me a good teacher.  
Koza's group was the first to achieve it and were praised in front of
everyone.

Then, around the time most people could manipulate magical power, we had
an interview.

"Hmm... as a squad leader, you're passable."

"That's right, Koza is perceptive. With training, he'll become quite
something."

After Krische-sama explained the squad's objective again, we were each
called in for basic tactical questions.  
Everyone was clueless about tactics.  
Most of the questions were designed to assess imagination and quick
thinking.

At the time, Krische-sama was, to us, an evil noble lady. Being
evaluated with a "passable" from her superior attitude was infuriating,
but nobody dared to defy someone the captain respected.

Even from my perspective, the captain was a good man, a model soldier.  
He was exactly the kind of person you'd imagine as a centurion, but he
was overly considerate of Krische-sama.

Was this great man weak to authority, or was that just how soldiers
were?  
We didn't know Krische-sama's true capabilities back then, and the
frequent interactions only fueled our skepticism.  
Most of us scoffed at rumors of her being a monster.  
Every time the captain bowed and scraped before Krische-sama, it made us
feel sick.

From there, the squad was reorganized, and we began combat-simulated
training in the forest.  
We were overjoyed at the grueling physical labor.  
The training there was truly inspiring.

In less than a month, the squad was completely transformed.  
Our bodies were initially overwhelmed by the unfamiliar body
enhancements, but once we mastered them, the potential was incredible.  
Those of us who had done rough work before could easily find lucrative
jobs if we left the army, and I was confident I could take on several of
my pre-magic-training self and win.

Then came the final test: a mock battle against the light infantry squad
selected as "red" in the selection process.  
Two centurys against us—double the enemy—and we won decisively.

They were nearly wiped out, while we only had seven declared dead. The
light infantry squad was the army's elite.  
Only the most skilled swordsmen were selected as "red," and overwhelming
them filled us with joy.

When the captain told us Krische-sama would personally assess our
abilities, we were ecstatic.  
The uncouth among us were already planning to rip the clothes off that
mad rabbit, beat her up, and make her cry. Koza was among them—he wanted
to humiliate her and vent his frustrations, and most of us felt the
same.

Krische-sama's training was harsh enough to make us feel that way. Even
now, I still think it was.

But of course, our opponent was Krische-sama. There's always someone
better, people aren't equal, and reality is unfair. The next day, we
were reminded that we were just nothing more than raw recruits.

If you ask me what the most unfair thing in life is, I'd say this:

Standing before Krische Christand, sword in hand.

Long time no see.  
I'm Sameme Nana, working under the name Himifumi Shigoro here.  
As mentioned in the preface, I'm announcing the publication of my book.

I apologize for this post being six months late.  
Actually, early this year, I received an offer from TO Books, and
quietly worked on the book after that.  
The April Fool's joke about a "(\*Important\*) Full Remake Announcement"
wasn't entirely a lie; it was in the midst of a full remake (aka
revision). However, the content is completely unrelated to the previous
version, so please note that! (It's an April Fool's joke!)

The theme of the story, "A Girl's Unwanted Heroic Tale," required
certain elements, but the commercial publication of this work was
hampered by the highly immoral and cruel depictions.  
Even with such an offer, if there are restrictions on these parts, then
commercial publication is difficult.  
Therefore, I was considering self-publishing an e-book eventually, but
TO Books and the editor who emailed me were very understanding about
this, and those parts related to the theme were kept as is.  
I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have my book published in this
excellent way.

After that, I discussed the direction with them and got down to work.  
I previously published a yuri novel, "Puppet Master," commercially, so
this process wasn't entirely new, but I realized while working, "I
couldn't have achieved this quality with self-publishing."  
People tend to get lazy.  
As I've often said about online serialization, it's full of typos,
misspellings and poorly written sentences. Even if I'd self-published a
vertically written book, I think I would have had a lazy attitude of "it
doesn't matter whether it sells or not."

But commercial publishing comes with responsibility.  
With so many people involved, you can't cut corners, and I had to
rigorously review the writing and structure to make sure readers would
think it's "good." As a result, I believe the final product is much
better than it would have been if I'd self-published. I can confidently
say it's much more readable and understandable than the serialized
version, so I hope fans and even those who just came to see the
announcement will pick it up!

Also, the publication of this book is thanks to the support of my
readers and fans.  
With zero bookmarks, completely unknown, an unassuming title, and a slow
start.  
When I started, I never thought this work would surpass 10,000
bookmarks.

Back then, I worried that "my idea of fun might not be understood by
others," and I just hoped that a few people would enjoy the story I
loved.  
But those who found this work interesting left comments and reviews,
promoted it in various places, and it's thanks to their support that I'm
here today.  
Among countless novels, I'm deeply grateful to those who recognized and
supported this unassuming work, considering it a good read.  
Thank you.

I'm so excited to share this news that I could go on forever, but I'll
stop here!

And now, for the announcement…

"A Girl's Unwanted Heroic Tale" will be released on January 15th, 2024,
by TO Books, in both book and ebook formats.  
The book itself includes two bonus short stories:

\* "The Night Without a Moon," depicting the Christand family the day
before Krische's arrival.

\* "The Ojou-sama," depicting a scene where Krische and Berry interrupt
Selene's studies.

Additionally, purchasers from the TO Books online store will receive:

\* "The Cat's Tale," a short story about cats.

Ebook versions will include:

\* "God's Gift," a bonus short story about the meeting between young
Krische and her adoptive mother Grace.

It's a great deal, so please consider it! I'll also be posting updates
on my Twitter.

The illustrator is Hanamoto-sama. They're a truly wonderful illustrator,
and I was moved by the character designs and rough sketches.  
They seriously considered the atmosphere of the work, and created a
cover and illustrations that perfectly fit this book. I hope you enjoy
them too!

This has been a long message, but thank you for reading. I'm truly happy
to share this news with everyone.
