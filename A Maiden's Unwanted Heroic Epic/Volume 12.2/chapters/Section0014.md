# Chapter 324 - The Creation of Heaven and Earth, a Journey of Eternity 1

Except for the two of you and Argan-sama, everyone has reverted to their
youthful appearance.  
Growing old, being old.  
While we naturally accepted it, there was an indescribable bewilderment
for the first three days.  
When we met with the rejuvenated Selene-sama and the others, there was a
strange awkwardness between us, but the easy acceptance was surely
thanks to Argan-sama.

Just Argan-sama's presence made us instantly comfortable, back in the
'mansion' from when we weren't yet old people.  
Now, we should be much older than she is, yet Argan-sama remained
unchanged as before, interacting with us so naturally that the passage
of years seemed to vanish into the distant past.

We must have accumulated a great deal over the years, and we must have
grown somewhat.  
Even I feel that way, so it must be even more so for others.  
Yet, as if we had returned to our past—or as if we had spent all these
years together—Argan-sama naturally remained at the center of the
mansion.

“……Truly, a considerable amount of time has passed.”

“Yes. Argan-sama, you have absolutely no memory of that day?”

“Yes…it’s as if I’ve had a long nap. I woke up suddenly naked in bed,
and, heh, I was quite surprised.”

The private room of Krische-sama—or rather, of Argan-sama, Krische-sama,
and Kreschenta-sama.  
A four-poster bed is placed in one corner, closets line the walls, and a
large desk and sofa are in the center.

Argan-sama sits there, with Krische-sama and Kreschenta-sama resting
their heads on either side of her thighs.  
Since arriving here, the two of them have spent most of their time by
Argan-sama's side.  
Considering their feelings, it's only natural.  
Gazing at their peaceful sleeping faces, Argan-sama strokes their heads,
a soft—unchanged, beautiful—smile on her face. She wears an apron dress.
Her once pale cheeks are now rosy, and the flesh that had thinned with
age is now plump again. With a youthful face and a gentle, kind smile of
a lady, the light from the window shines divinely upon the three of
them.

My nose tingles, and I almost burst into tears, pressing my fingertips
to the corner of my eyes.  
Seeing this, Argan-sama chuckles wryly and says she’s sorry for the
trouble.

“The mansion has changed so little that I didn’t really feel like
decades have passed…no, I suppose it's inappropriate to say such things
lightly.”

“……Such things are nothing.”

“But, looking around, I do feel the passage of time in the fine details
of the mansion. There's a scratch on this desk that I don't recognize…”

“Th-that's, uh, I did that during the spring cleaning…”

“Ah, I see.”

She chuckles softly, affectionately tracing the scratch on the desk with
his finger.  
I had tripped while carrying Krische-sama’s gauntlets and hit the
desk.  
Seeing Argan-sama's joyful smile, my nose tingles again.

I should be quite an elderly woman. I’ve lived twice as many years as
Argan-sama and am now more experienced as both a person and a servant,
yet Argan-sama remains perfect, the same object of my admiration.  
Even the simple fact that I am now older than her feels strange, and I
even have the illusion that we have spent many years together unchanged.

As if the years without Argan-sama never existed, as if they were a bad
dream, Argan-sama is still Argan-sama.  
She is the great servant I admire and respect. To me, she remains my
superior, a senior I should respect.

The Grand Marshal whose name is known throughout the continent. Even
Selene-sama, who was respected by all warriors, remains an Ojou-sama.
Despite the worries she had, when we meet, she immediately starts
playfully arguing, and the scene is a seamless continuation from
before.  
Selene-sama's scolding and complaints to Argan-sama are just like when I
first visited Christand, making me feel that this mansion hasn't changed
a bit since then.

—To spend eternity with them.  
The reason I didn't question that future is probably this.  
After the civil war, the world outside the mansion changed rapidly, but
inside the mansion, nothing has changed for ten years.  
During the day, we go to work, and at night, we gather for meals and
talk over tea.

I never questioned those days.  
I do the mansion’s work, take care of Krische-sama and the others,
sleep, and wake up in the morning. A peaceful, pleasant, happy everyday
life—I wish it could continue forever.  
I must have subconsciously wished for eternity.

My only fear is the loss of that everyday life. When Krische-sama said
she wanted to create eternity, unlike Selene-sama, I accepted it quite
readily, albeit with some hesitation.  
How naive of me.  
I imagine people as thoughtful as Selene-sama, Elvena-san, and Lila-sama
would have many concerns, and I feel a little sorry for that.

The mansion remains unchanged, filled with familiar and beloved
people.  
A week has passed since we welcomed Lila-sama as a guest, and eternity
has begun.  
The scene before me perfectly reflects the happiness I envisioned.

“By the way…aren't you going to sit down, Anne-san ? You still seem to
be getting used to your body; standing all the time must be tiring.”

“N-no, I must get used to my body quickly so I don't cause trouble…”

I raise my arms, open and close my hands, and my eyes dart around.  
Everyone except for the three of them is struggling with this new
body.  
If I relax, I feel like I might fall over; it's a body that doesn't feel
like my own.  
Washing myself is still difficult; I even had the rare experience of
almost drowning in the bathwater—for now, everyone bathes together.  
Even getting dressed in the morning, I need Elvena-san's help to put on
my apron dress, so getting used to this body is an urgent matter.

Even Selene-sama, who is used to manipulating her body with magic, still
seems to have some discomfort, and she and Lila-sama, who is training in
martial arts, are still training in the garden.  
Knowing their efforts, I, a servant, can't afford to slack off.

And Selene-sama, needless to say, Lila-sama is the same.  
In Kreisharana, they're taught how to handle magic from a young age,
regardless of gender, and Elvena-san is skilled in handling magic thanks
to assisting Krische-sama; she has a natural talent that is incomparable
to mine.  
The one who is slowest to get used to this body is, without a doubt,
Anne Giterns, the servant.

“Nonsense, compared to me. And we have plenty of time, so you can take
your time getting used to it.”

“B-but…”

“Rest is important. You'll naturally get used to it as you do the
mansion's work.”

However, it would be against the principles of being a servant to refuse
such kindness.  
Heeding Argan-sama's words, I sit on the single-seater sofa diagonally
in front of her.  
As soon as I sit down, I feel my body relaxing, and I consciously
straighten my back.  
Argan-sama chuckles, then traces her lips with her fingertip.  
As always, a somewhat seductive gesture—she gazes at the ceiling,
thoughtfully saying,

“However…now that my national duties are over, I seem to have a lot of
free time.  
The mansion's work isn't that much.”

“That's…true.”

I nod.  
Cleaning, laundry, meal preparation.  
Even after Argan-sama left, Elvena-san and I managed it quite well.
Kreschenta-sama was occasionally accompanied by Elvena-san for her work,
and there were days when we put off the mansion's work, but on such
days, Krische-sama takes care of everything quite easily.  
Kreschenta-sama occasionally grumbles about the troublesome financial
management of Christand, but she takes care of it quite easily (her
processing speed is 1200 times faster than mine), so we've never had any
problems.

If we don't need the services of a valet, that would leave the four of
us to do the mansion's work.  
Even so, that's still a small number of people, but most of the
mansion's work can be done by Argan-sama alone.  
Adding me, Elvena-san, and Krische-sama would make it excessive.

Even if we did a more thorough job, there's a limit to the amount of
work we can take on, and most of it would be done before noon.  
Now, I'm spending each day needlessly busy because I'm not yet used to
this body, but Krische-sama said that I'll get used to it in a few years
at most.

“Do you have anything in mind for your free time?”

“For now…ah, but, I've been thinking of trying to write a story…”

“A story…”

“It's nothing grand…but I thought I might write it down and make a
book.  
It reminded me of the time I made a book of letters to my father.”

Ah, Argan-sama chuckles.  
I haven’t shown her the finished books of 'letters,' but I remember
Argan-sama had the same expression when she saw them, making me blush.

“At that time, I asked a bookbinder to help with various things, but now
that I have plenty of time, I thought I would make a story book myself,
from start to finish…”

“A story book…heh, that sounds fun. A true luxury.”

“Yes.”

Books are rather expensive.  
Most of them are academic in nature, and few are for entertainment.  
Children's books containing famous stories are readily available, but
they are still just fairy tales and fables.  
Even in the royal library, with its thousands of books, there were only
a handful of books made purely for adult entertainment.  
Of course, there may be more somewhere, but they certainly aren't as
common as those found in city bookstores.

Making the books I want to read myself sounds fun, and it was one of the
things I thought about if we were to truly live forever.

“What about you, Argan-sama?”

“Yes. Expanding the orchard or creating a vegetable garden from scratch
would be nice. Collecting seedlings and seeds from various places,
breeding new varieties myself, harvesting delicious vegetables and
fruits, and cooking them.  
I’ve been interested in this for a long time, but it takes time and
effort, so I gave up on it with a small orchard.”

“I see…”

“Heh, I’m sure Krische-sama will enjoy it too.”

She says this with a gentle smile, stroking Krische-sama's head.  
Her truly happy sleeping face looks like a child's, and seeing that
makes me truly feel relieved.  
Since coming here, both of them have become much brighter, their
happiness radiating from their entire beings.

“I would like to help you then.”

“Thank you.  
But that will be a little later…we’ll start in earnest after we get used
to life here and things settle down.”

“Yes.”

As I gaze at Argan-sama's gentle smile, I almost gasp in admiration.  
Argan-sama is here, Krische-sama and the others are here, and I am here.

The mansion I dreamed of has returned.

Previously, I worked at a place called the Ilne Mansion.  
One of seven mansions built in the Royal Gardens, called the King's
Garden.  
The most frequently used of them was the Ilne Mansion, mainly used by
nobles—a place where the royal family welcomed their subjects.

It was more of a reception hall shaped like a mansion rather than a
mansion itself.  
We sometimes welcomed different nobles in the morning, afternoon, and
evening, and while it was busy during busy periods, it was rare for
people to stay overnight.  
There weren't many people staying there.

I am a servant of the royal domain. For about half a year after I
started, I was satisfied with that title.  
I was probably too busy learning my job.

But what I dreamed of and envisioned was a 'servant who served someone,'
and I felt an incongruity in my daily life, just doing my job in an
apron dress.  
Welcoming guests, taking care of them, and seeing them off.  
The work wasn't without its merits, but when I saw the servants who
visited the mansion with their masters, I felt something was different.

Servants of the royal domain don't have a master to serve and pledge
allegiance to.  
Of course, officially, we were serving the royal family, but the royal
family were beings above the clouds, beings we never spoke to or made
eye contact with.  
I occasionally saw Kreschenta-sama and His Majesty walking in the
distance, but it was too far from serving.

An indescribable sense of stagnation.  
Being at a loss for words is what it means to be in such a situation.
What am I doing here?  
It's just a fairy tale after all; reality doesn't work like a story.  
Just as I was starting to give up, the Christand family—and
Argan-sama—visited.

The emotion I felt at that time was immeasurable.

Argan-sama is the kind of person who has incredibly low self-esteem (a
characteristic of the people in this mansion, perhaps).  
I still feel frustrated that this hasn’t been communicated well, but in
any case, it was a bolt from the blue.  
I truly wondered if such a person existed in this world; my head felt
like it had been hit with a blunt object.

Meeting someone who embodies your ideal is a violent experience.  
You understand it at a glance, and your whole being is captivated.  
Like a sudden light in the darkness, it illuminates everything around
you, revealing the path ahead—a world so dazzling that you can't even
imagine a world without it.

Everyone has ideals they want to achieve in their childhood.  
As adults, with a bit of common sense, they give up on those dreams.  
For example, if they are a man, they may want to be a general.  
However, no matter how hard one tries, achieving a dream requires luck,
talent, and opportunity, which are not given to everyone.  
Even a centurion is one in a hundred who aspire to it—children's dreams
usually don't come true.  
Giving up on them isn't shameful; it's common sense for an adult, I
believe.  
If I hadn't met Argan-sama that day, I would probably have been one of
those people.

I didn't think it was a bad thing, and I'm sure I would have been happy
enough.  
For example, if I had returned to my family home, married a nobleman,
and had children, my former self would have laughed about going to the
royal domain with such foolish ideas, without a trace of shame.  
I might have lectured children who had foolish dreams, looking down on
them with a superior air.

But my ideal appeared before me in the form of Argan-sama.  
I couldn't dismiss it as a foolish ideal or a child's dream.  
To serve the same master by her side.  
If the brilliance of such a future appeared, there was nothing left to
do but reach out and walk towards it.

Looking back, my life has been all about that encounter.  
Before and after that meeting, everything about my ordinary self
changed.

“Kuku, I see…youth is power.”

“S-sorry.  
I got carried away…”

After the final battle of the civil war ended, Gallen-sama, who had
fallen slightly ill after the fighting, was lying in a bed in a tent.
While I nursed him, our conversation turned to the reason I came to
Christand.  
I felt ashamed of having become so passionate in my explanation, and
Gallen-sama shook his head with a wry smile.

"No, that was just right. Berry... well, to put it negatively, she's a
bit difficult, or rather, shy."

"...Shy?"

Gallen-sama sat up and nodded, reaching for herbal tea on a box serving
as a side table.

"Especially in the past. We've known each other for about twenty years
since our first meeting, but I have almost no memory of properly talking
to her for the first ten years. I hardly ever saw her smile. She was
originally a very quiet girl... she's become much brighter now, but that
doesn't mean her inherent shyness has become a strength."

"Is that so..."

Gallen-sama nodded and took a sip of herbal tea.  
She didn't seem shy at all. She was gentle and polite to everyone, never
without a smile, someone who would be liked but never make enemies.  
She had a rather approachable atmosphere, and that wasn't just me.

"Her sister, Lazura, was the opposite – a very energetic, strong
woman... even Bogan was henpecked by her. Those sisters were truly like
the sun and the moon. After Lazura passed away, she pushed herself very
hard... truly a fortunate turn of events. Meeting Krische seems to have
improved her greatly."

That also applies to Selene, Gallen-sama continued, taking a breath.

"Krische, as you can see, is a somewhat unusual girl. She can do
difficult things exceedingly well, but sometimes she doesn't understand
simple things. I was worried when I decided to entrust her to Bogan,
wondering if she would be accepted... but perhaps it was good that she
was like that.  
They probably had something in common."

Thinking about their common ground, I pictured their faces. If asked if
they resembled each other, they were completely different.  
However, I understood how difficult it is to earn the sincere respect of
someone like Krische-sama, who is so strict with herself and others.

A girl who calmly instructs a warrior famed throughout the surrounding
world.  
Her talent is beyond simply calling her a genius.  
Even someone like Selene-sama, whom a commoner like me can only call a
genius, isn't even comparable in that regard.

"Because she's too intelligent, she sees too much, I suppose.  
That's why she thinks about everything logically, sometimes getting lost
in that dead end... without realizing that she could easily figure
things out by following her simple emotions."

Gallen-sama looked at me with a gentle smile in his eyes.

"...In that sense, it's truly fortunate that someone like you has come
to the mansion."

"W-well, I, I just sort of barged in... and I'm still causing you so
much trouble."

"I wouldn't say it's trouble. ...Your way of leaving the royal territory
simply because of a longing must be quite dazzling to Berry. Of course,
some people would call you foolish."

He chuckled and pointed to his own head.

"But, whether intelligence leads to happiness is another matter. Being
able to act as you do, following your heart honestly, is the greatest
virtue."

"Virtue..."

"Your parents' upbringing must have been good, too. ...When you settle
down, send them a letter.  
I'm sure they're very worried."

"Y-yes."

Gallen-sama smiled kindly, and I felt a little embarrassed, my eyes
darting around. I had a huge fight with my father before leaving home.  
At the time, I wondered why he didn't understand, but of course, it's
natural for a father to worry about his daughter.  
I certainly felt guilty.

"...It's good to be straightforward. Of course, you have your reasons,
but parents worry about their children no matter how old they get. Words
that seem nagging are also a form of affection. ...It's good if it just
ends with a fight, but sometimes it festers, and you may lose the chance
to apologize forever."

"...Yes."

"I also had a falling out with my father... I respected him, but he
tried to stop me from becoming a soldier, and in a moment of anger, I
insulted him... by the time I went back, I couldn't even apologize."

Gallen-sama said, looking off into the distance.

"True foolishness is like that. ...To avoid that, make sure you say what
you need to say."

He stroked my head as I nodded.  
When I first saw him, he seemed strict, but he was incredibly kind. His
voice was calm and composed, surprisingly soft.

"As you grow older, it becomes even more difficult to follow your
heart.  
You become controlled by pointless pride, cause and effect, logic,
reason, position and responsibility, and I've accumulated so much
foolish regret. ...I didn't say a kind word to my wife, whom I promised
to make happy, before she passed away alone... I've only honestly said
'I love you' a few times in my youth."

He lowered his eyes sadly and closed them.  
Then, looking at me, he continued.

"Therefore, I believe that being able to tell people what's on your mind
honestly, without any pretense, like you, is an amazing talent."

Meeting Berry Argan was shocking, turning my whole world upside down.
The path to a beautiful world like a fairy tale – but in a landscape
where everything shines, even walking is daunting. In a world where
everything shines, I feel like an alien.

"...Treasure that. By doing so, you will surely take the right path,
which many people get wrong. ...It's a great asset that surpasses
foolish intelligence."

I don't know how much courage Gallen-sama's words gave me. I think I was
probably incredibly foolish.  
I'm used to being told that, and I feel that way myself.

That's why, it was the first time I'd been told it was wonderful – and
Gallen-sama probably doesn't realize how grateful and happy I was to
hear those words.

"...What's wrong?"

"I-I'm sorry. I'm just so happy..."

Gallen-sama, looking troubled, smiled wryly, and his hand gently stroked
my head.  
Tears flowed uncontrollably, and I wiped my eyes with a handkerchief,
bowing my head.

Before me, lost and bewildered – if Argan-sama created the heavens and
earth, then

"Really, it's not something to cry about."

Gallen-sama gave me the courage to walk in that world.

To me, they were both like gods.  
They would probably look troubled and deny that I was overdoing the
compliment.

--But I think that's how I feel.
