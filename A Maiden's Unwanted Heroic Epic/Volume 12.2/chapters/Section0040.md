# Chapter 350 - Magical Girl Magical☆Berry CDN Extra Edition ~Her Majesty's Magnificent Everyday Life~

AN

Despite saying it's April Fool's Day, Magical☆Berry continues to be
updated, and this is the fifth installment.

Although we didn't make it in time and missed April Fool's Day, we don't
think that's a big deal.

This is because Magical☆Berry is not a ridiculously stupid spin-off
posted on April Fool's Day; the day that Magical☆Berry was posted was
April Fool's Day.

Because I choose to believe it.

Dear readers (omitted)

—---

"My, Kreschenta-sama, it is morning."

At 5:30 in the early morning, when the red-haired servant wakes up, the
fairy queen Kreschenta awakens.  
Kreschenta's bed, a canopy bed, sits between the red-haired servant's
pillow and her sister's pillow. It's a meticulously crafted miniature
bed, part of the Princess Mimi-chan Royal Room Set (list price: 39,800
yen), a highly popular miniature set for children that has moved many
adults to tears.

"I want to sleep a little longer…"

"Hmm…what a lazy girl."

"Hee hee, shall we go, Krische-sama?"

The red-haired servant gently lifts the miniature canopy bed, carrying
Kreschenta carefully. The gentle rocking motion lulls her back to
sleep.  
She is carried to the Princess Mimi-chan Royal Room on a shelf in the
first-floor living room.  
She is gently placed in the bed, and a white cloth is draped over it.

The light is softly obscured, a time of slumber between dreams and
reality.  
The sounds of conversation—like, what should we have for breakfast
today?—and the sounds of cooking drift from the kitchen, lulling her
into a light sleep.

Kreschenta, queen among fairies, is overwhelmed with numerous duties and
constantly exasperated by the incompetence of her servants. Her days are
never restful. To recover from her exhaustion, her sleep must be deep,
and her awakening gradual and gentle.  
While cuddling a body pillow in bed, she slowly regains consciousness,
her internal systems performing a complex awakening process.

"Nyururun, please let me smell the stew for a moment."

A tentacle writhes, \*nyururun\*, picks up a bowl of soup, approaches
the Princess Mimi-chan Royal Room, gently lifts the cloth, and pours
some soup inside.  
A rich, creamy aroma wafts out. It's a stew made with plenty of
mushrooms and milk.

\*Kyururu\*, the queen's stomach rumbles reflexively. Naturally.  
Her deep, ocean-like sleep is for recovering from immense fatigue. The
energy consumed for recovery is far greater than one would imagine from
her small body.  
Simply put, she is starving. Only Kreschenta's, the fairy queen's,
remarkable self-control allows her to endure this suffering.

The pangs of hunger, suppressed during her restorative sleep, suddenly
return. Kreschenta’s brow furrows, but she doesn't wake. A rational
decision, a heartbreaking choice to prioritize her physical recovery
through sleep. Even after the cloth is lowered again, the rich aroma of
the stew permeates the Princess Mimi-chan Royal Room.

Sleep versus stew.  
In her mind, said to possess wisdom surpassing even the gods, a balance
teeters.  
A matter of life and death, or rather, a choice that could influence the
fate of the world, including deep space—a monumental decision. The scale
sways toward sleep, toward the stew, indicating neither.

"Berry, this peach is incredibly sweet!"

"Oh, it really is. Krische-sama's judgment was spot on."

"Ehehe…"

—But then, the mention of a peach rings out.  
At the sound of those words, one side of the scale slams to the
ground.  
High-quality stew, a delicious peach dessert.  
Even if it slightly reduces her sleeping time, it would likely
sufficiently replenish Kreschenta's depleted body.

Consciousness returns.  
She flutters her wings, \*patari, patari\*, waiting.

"Good morning."

"Good morning."

"It's stew today!"

"Fufu, it looks delicious."

The sound of tableware being set on the table echoes, and after a while,
the blonde appears as usual. But Kreschenta doesn't move. It is
unthinkable for a noble queen to flutter to the table to receive her
meal.

"Nyururun."

Her sister's voice rings out, and the cloth is lifted again.  
Gazing at her with its odd single eye is her pet tentacle, Nyururun.
They stare at each other for a moment, and Nyururun bows its head (all
of its heads)—or at least makes a gesture resembling a bow. Then, it
gently lifts Kreschenta with its tentacles. It's a rather
indecent-looking creature, but it's a well-behaved pet. Compared to the
clueless blonde and her ditzy sister, it's far superior.

Kreschenta doesn't feel the need to complain to a creature lower than
the lower-class servants.  
However, she glares at the red-haired servant, thinking how improper it
is for a noble queen to be carried by her pet rather than a human
servant.

"Good morning, Kreschenta-sama."

"Magical Berry. You've become quite important, haven't you? To have me
carried by a pet."

"You're always so high and mighty…"

"I am the most noble queen in the fairy world, and indeed in this
world."

The red-haired servant merely chuckles.  
The tentacle climbs onto a chair, extends its indecent tentacles,
arranges the tableware (from the Cooking Mimi-chan Ristorante set, list
price: 19,800 yen) on the miniature table, and looks inquiringly before
arranging the chairs.  
After indicating the red-haired servant's ample rear with its gaze, it
bows its head (all of its heads) in a gesture of respect. It places
Kreschenta on the red-haired servant's excessively large, fleshy
rear—dressed in a cooking apron—lifts the miniature table, and holds it
steady.

"I wish you'd stop, it's obstructing my view."

The impertinent blonde, sitting opposite the red-haired servant, says
with a sigh, and Kreschenta glares at her.

"Where I eat is my decision."

"……Look,"

"Kreschenta is really a spoiled brat."

Berry chuckles and waves her hand.  
Stew, bread, salad, and fruit appear on the miniature plates, and orange
juice materializes out of thin air.

"Well then, let's eat."

"You truly spoil this fly."

Selene, while saying this, folds her hands and says, "Itadakimasu" (a
Japanese expression of gratitude before a meal).

A tentacle reaches towards Kreschenta, who has her arms crossed.  
The tip of the tentacle divides into countless tiny tentacles, with a
small eyeball in the center.  
It skillfully manipulates a miniature knife, spoon, and fork. Nyururun's
tentacle manipulation skills, honed through years of training, are
remarkable. He is, without a doubt, a first-class Tentacle Servant.  
He swiftly acts, sensing that Her Majesty has no intention of eating
with her own two hands.

And Kreschenta, the queen of the fairy world and ruler of the world,
accepts this service.  
Even though many consider tentacle creatures—the lowest of the low,
mostly ugly and obscene—she doesn't discriminate, recognizing not their
appearance but their sincerity, and accepting their service. She doesn't
feel any disgust at the sight of the countless tentacles writhing before
her face.

It is only natural. From Kreschenta’s perspective, everything in this
world is equally inferior. Whether it's the fairy-like red-haired
servants or the obscene tentacle, if she overlooks them from the heights
of heaven, there is no difference.  
Without anger, she guides the spoon and fork with her gaze, as if to
ask, "What would you like next?".

It would be unnecessary interaction with the red-haired servant, but the
tentacle is, after all, a pet. It is only natural that it is inferior to
the red-haired servant, and her heart, broader and deeper than the
universe itself, wouldn't be bothered by such a thing.  
She focuses on replenishing her energy, moving her mouth, \*mogumogu
gokkun\*, opening and closing it repeatedly.

"Ehehe, Nyururun is a good boy."

Nyururun writhes, \*nyururun\*, without moving the miniature table it's
holding, even slightly.  
All its tentacles are dedicated to serving the great Queen (as it has
been taught), and its family and friends, gathered in the dining room,
are proud to see it performing such a sophisticated task of attending to
her meal. They too skillfully use spoons and tentacles, enjoying the
stew and baked bread with smiles (or what appear to be smiles), while
his wife diligently feeds her husband. Nyururun blushes a little, and
his children and friends watch this scene with affectionate smiles.

"How is it, my lady?"

"It's delicious… the meal, I mean."

Selene, opposite the queen, keeps her eyes down, avoiding Berry’s gaze
as she eats, her tentacles wriggling at her chest. She lamented that she
was the only one with normal common sense, but she herself was already
accustomed to the sight of eating surrounded by tentacle pets.

『Magical Girl Magical☆Berry CDN Extra Story ~Her Majesty's Splendid
Everyday Life~』

It was a Saturday.  
The head of the household, Bogan, was on a business trip overseas, and
Berry was driving the minivan.  
In the passenger seat, Krische held the full Kreschenta, who was asleep
on her lap, happily planning what to buy and what to make for today's
barbecue.

In the back seat:

"Nyururun, something's coming at us in droves!"

Selene was playing a mobile game with Nyururun bathed in a washbasin.  
While Nyururun and the others had gotten used to human society and no
longer unconsciously secreted bodily fluids, they still tended to become
slimy when they got excited while concentrating on something.  
The rule in the Krishta family was that whenever they played games, they
had to do it inside a washbasin.

It was an action game about controlling magical girls to stop the plot
of the 'Root Tentacle', a being lurking in the depths of space, and this
was a test play for difficulty adjustment. The game was based on the
exploits of the Magical Berry girls in the recently released movie,
'Magical Girl Magical☆Berry CDN Theatrical Version ~The Exorcist☆Shelna:
A Wonder Beyond Time and Space~',  
and delved into finer details not shown in the movie. Even Selene, who
was more of a performer than a player, was impressed by the meticulous
settings, commenting, "So that's how it is". It had a heavy worldview
and exhilarating action, targeting fans who had watched the original
Magical Girl Magical Berry in real time, as well as adult fans.  
Several years after the Magical Girl War, Selene, who had gotten into
games to some degree, and Nyururun, a professional gamer who handled
test plays for Fairy Soft and also did streaming, found the game
enjoyable.

The righteous tentacles of Nyururun and the evil tentacles used by the
'Root Tentacle'.  
The idea of considering their tentacle god as evil and fighting fellow
tentacle creatures and amoebas was a bit awkward, but it was just a game
after all.  
Using skillful maneuvers, Selene deftly used the technical character
'Nyururun' to save Magical Selene from danger and wipe out the countless
evil tentacles.

"…This is mainly close-range combat, but Magical Selene seems
considerably weak…"

Nyururun nodded slightly in agreement, but skillfully operated Selene's
smartphone.

\['Magical Selene has high attack, mobility, and durability, but with
almost no long-range attacks, she is very difficult to handle in this
game. A hit-and-run tactic seems good.'\]

"Mmm, hit-and-run…"

Nyururun extended a tentacle, took the game console from the troubled
Selene, and handed over his own game console. Nyururun skillfully
controlled the characters, and the next thing to appear was another
group of tentacles.

"Hey, Nyururun!"

'Magical Selene' rushed into the group of tentacles, using a close-range
combo that sliced through them.  
Against the tentacle attack that followed the combo, she activated
Magical Shield.  
The light shield repelled the attack, causing the tentacles to recoil,
and then she unleashed her ultimate move, Great Magical Sword. The
tentacles in front were sliced and scattered by the great sword of
light, and before the remaining tentacles on the sides could surround
her, she used Magical Wing to jump backward.  
It was a remarkably skillful display.

\['That's the way to do it.'\]

"You're really good. Oh, 'Nyururun' might be fun after all."

Nyururun freely wielded its tentacles, \*nyurun nyurun\*, mowing down
enemies. Selene smiled, wiped out the remaining enemies, and exchanged
game consoles again.  
The next destination was the doll shop, 'Killzaran'.

Leaving Selene and Nyururun in the car, Krische, Berry, and one more
person went into the store.  
"We've arrived," said Krische, stroking the queen's cheek. Kreschenta,
drowsy in Krische's hands, slowly woke up. The shelves were lined with
countless dolls and miniatures.  
From mass-produced items to one-of-a-kind pieces, there were numerous
changeable dresses, a well-known suburban specialty store.

"My, my, Ms. Yuga. Welcome."

A middle-aged, overweight shopkeeper, Roland, was at the counter. He was
a gentleman who loved dolls, and he smiled at the sight of Kreschenta in
Krische's hands. —To him, Kreschenta looked like a doll.

"Hello, we've come to pick up the items we ordered…"

"Yes, yes. I have them ready. Please confirm them."

More than the beautiful two, he was fascinated by Kreschenta in
Krische's hands.

He had been blessed with poor looks and had a strong complex about it,
making it difficult for him to communicate with others. The only thing
he trusted was his speechless dolls. He bought dolls with his allowance
and poured his part-time earnings into his hobby. He ran away from home
to escape his parents, who disliked his hobby, desperately saved money,
opened an online shop, and now owned a store. He made miniatures for
dolls, made costumes, and enjoyed his life with dolls.  
And the doll shop 'Killzaran', where like-minded people gathered, was
his dreamland.

He presented a tiny tea set and three one-piece dresses. And underwear
and nightwear.  
They were meticulously crafted to fit Kreschenta's 'measurements', and
the back was widely open to avoid hindering her characteristic
fairy-like wings.

"How is it, Kreschenta-sama?"

"It's… acceptable."

"Fufu, I'm glad."

Roland watched with a gentle smile as Berry spoke to the doll.  
He didn't disdain her speaking to a supposedly speechless doll, but felt
genuine joy as a fellow enthusiast.  
If approached with sincerity, the doll would respond.  
Berry's one-of-a-kind doll, Kreschenta, was set as a noble queen,
befitting a fairy queen.  
The slightly arrogant words, "It's...acceptable", were not
hallucinations to him; in this place, it was the truth.  
It wasn't just playing with dolls; in this place, 'she' was alive.

The exquisitely crafted beauty, the purple eyes and white skin that
looked alive.  
The red-gold hair shimmered with an indescribable luster.  
Even taking her outside without keeping her in a case, how much care
would be needed to reach such beauty?  
When he considered how this kimono-clad beauty usually treats 'her', he
felt deeply moved.

"Thank you, Your Majesty. I'm glad you're pleased."

"It's decent work as always. Don't be complacent, keep striving for
improvement."

"……Yes."

This doll is alive, thought Roland.  
The arrogant—no, the noble voice of the queen praised him.  
At least, that's how it sounded to Roland, and he bowed deeply with
heartfelt respect.

'She' was not a doll, but truly the queen of the fairies.  
In this place, that was the truth, and Roland was the purveyor and
tailor to Her Majesty. He could even visualize 'her' looking around the
store with a displeased expression and fluttering her wings.

Their encounter began with an email. A request to make underwear and
costumes for a doll.  
The email was polite, with precise measurements and photos.

Because the price was good and the doll was a beautiful, well-maintained
doll, Roland readily agreed and asked for photos after the doll was
dressed.  
He was captivated by the lively expressions and natural poses of 'her'
wearing his creations. After the third order, he requested to meet 'her'
in person at his shop.

The moment he saw the real 'her,' the emotion was unforgettable.  
Berry's unreserved interaction with 'Kreschenta-sama' in public, and
Krische's elder-sister-like admonishments.  
Roland felt ashamed of his previous assumption that the dolls were just
dolls. He truly believed and hoped a personality and soul resided within
them, realizing that the dolls ceased being mere dolls when he
acknowledged this.  
His approach to the dolls changed completely.

His encounter with 'her' also altered his approach to crafting, leading
to more emails from other customers expressing deep gratitude.  
It was all thanks to the dolls and 'Her Majesty.'

"And this is a bonus, I made a costume wardrobe for Kreschenta-sama..."

From under the counter, he presented a meticulously crafted miniature
wardrobe.  
He'd paid attention to detail, making it as close as possible to a
human-sized wardrobe, including the hangers.  
He clearly had deep affection for this red-haired beauty.  
All custom-made miniatures and props for 'her' were designed with
practicality in mind, for 'her' to actually use.

Rather than playing with dolls, he was creating furniture for 'one small
fairy' – 'her.'  
The bedding was the same.  
While the Princess Mimi-chan Royal Room Set's bed was already
high-quality, he further modified it to suit 'her' preferences,
showcasing genuine passion.

"Are you sure about this?"

"Yes, please... I'm more than happy to continue being your customer."

"Thank you. Kreschenta-sama, this is a wonderful wardrobe."

Krische handed 'her' over to Kreschenta, who stood before the wardrobe.
Kreschenta opened it, examined the interior, and nodded.

"It seems quite suitable for everyday use. Magical Berry, I'd like to
see other items as well."

"Yes. Mr. Roland, may we also look around the store?"

"Of course, take your time..."

He smiled and watched them, two dolls and one pet, walk through the
store.  
He was certain they were real fairies.  
He imagined Kreschenta flitting about, admiring the miniatures and
costumes he'd made, and he wiped a tear from his eye.

The emotion of their beautiful bond had moved him to tears.

Roland chuckled softly, "I shouldn't be so sentimental as I get older."

He bought a few more items and left Kilzaran, Roland's pure-hearted
middle-aged doll shop.  
After buying groceries, he went home.  
The afternoon was reserved for a barbecue with the Exorcist Shelna and
the Far East Seventh Branch.

The main meat was being brought by the others; his contribution would be
seafood and mushrooms. While preparing these, he also made a light soup
and dessert, and various sauces for the meat and seafood.

While Krische and Berry worked on this, Selene and the Nyururun prepared
chairs, tables, and the grill.

Naturally, Kreschenta's task was to supervise her servants.  
She sat atop a Nyururin, a small tentacle creature, directing them,
pointing out what was missing.  
She tasted the sauces and soups, kept busy amidst the preparations.

"Nyururin, next is Magical Selene's area."

Nyururin, a smaller tentacle than Nyururun, wriggled and scurried off.
Even though they were servants, they were Kreschenta’s direct
subordinates, preparing a feast. Any shortcomings would reflect badly on
Kreschenta’s honor.  
It was a matter of utmost importance.

Kreschenta was the best of the best, transcending mere categorization as
'first-rate'.  
Everything around her – clothes, food, servants – had to be first-rate;
otherwise, it was a disgrace to her.  
She accepted all the labor as her queenly responsibility.

Being a queen wasn't simply a matter of status; it was a way of life.  
She was a sun guiding her misguided, incompetent servants, a moon
illuminating the darkness.  
She accepted and forgave even the most disrespectful of creatures with
immense generosity. That was the Fairy Queen Kreschenta.

She fluttered from the tentacle to Selene’s golden hair.  
Three grills were set up in the garden, along with a large table and
four small ones. Selene's DIY chairs and several folding chairs were
haphazardly arranged.  
Nodding, she found the basic setup satisfactory, and addressed Selene.

"Magical Selene, perhaps it's time to light the fire?"

"You just want to watch. Kids love fire."

"I am not a child."

"It's more fun to light it when Shelna-senpai arrives.  
That's part of the barbecue experience."

"As queen, I need to verify the charcoal will ignite properly."

"You're so annoying... Fine, one grill is fine."

Selene sighed, using her 'Bottoman' lighter to ignite the fire starter.
She watched the flames ignite the charcoal.  
Fanning with a hand fan, she worked to get the coals glowing.

"You need to direct the wind from below upwards."

"Yes, yes..."

Kreschenta sighed at her instructions.  
Observing the growing light and heat, Selene brought Kreschenta closer
to the grill. The small body leaned forward eagerly.  
Selene chuckled at the sight.

Did her father and Berry watch the fire starting this way when she was a
schoolgirl?  
The glowing embers, strengthening with every gust of wind, held a
strange fascination for her.  
She was spoiled, arrogant, careless, greedy, and uncouth, a truly awful
insect, but when quiet, she looked surprisingly cute.

"Oh, you've already started the fire?"

"Kreschenta was making a fuss."

Chuckling at Selene's words, Krische and Berry began arranging food on
the tables.  
Shelna and her group arrived shortly after.

"Hello."

"Excuse us."

Four people arrived: Shelna, Ledo, Toba, and Feni.  
They were exorcists from the Far East Seventh Branch, living in a house
across the way.  
The two men carried large coolers on their shoulders; the two women
shared one.

"Hello, Shelna-senpai."

"Hello. How have you been? I see Berry-san and Krische-chan often, but
it feels like it’s been a while since I've seen Selene."

"Y-yes, I suppose it has been..."

It had only been three days since they last fought as Magical Selene.  
Out of pity for Shelna, who was constantly manipulated by the insect
queen, and an awkwardness that was hard to ignore, Selene had avoided
her.  
Unlike Berry and Krische, Selene was extremely rational and sensible.

Selene transferred to the school as a second-year student when she was
in her first year of high school. While initially apprehensive, they
were initially allies.  
Later, they became close neighbors and seniors/juniors in the student
council. The following year, with Selene as student council president,
she worked alongside Krische as a discipline committee member, enjoying
a peaceful school life. However, since Berry became a demon and the
"Exorcist Shelna" series began, Selene's guilt and awkwardness had
grown. Shelna was a very sincere and pure person.

Selene desperately wanted to confess about the insect and apologize, but
the thought of Shelna, who was genuinely trying to help Magical Berry,
discovering the truth made her hesitate.

"Hello, Kreschenta.  
Fufu, you're beautiful and cute as ever."

"It's so obvious it doesn't even qualify as a compliment."

Kreschenta’s head was stroked.  
The insect on her hand puffed up, crossing its arms in displeasure.  
To Shelna and the others, she appeared as a pink bird, her voice
sounding like chirps and peeps.  
However, Shelna constantly wondered about the insect’s bold demeanor.  
The Nyururun wriggling at their feet appeared as purple dogs, a far cry
from their actual appearance.  
Selene’s aversion to the tentacles had lessened, replaced with affection
and even occasional cuteness, though she still needed to avert her gaze
to avoid losing her appetite.

How she wished she could also see them as dogs.  
It was unfair that she was the only one affected by their appearance.  
Berry, and even Krische, seemed unfazed by the tentacles, causing Selene
to curse her own common sense.

While Shelna cheerfully referred to the insect as a “gentle little
bird,” Selene longed for Shelna to realize the truth, her heart aching.

"Well, it all looks delicious."

"Yes, it's a bit unusual, but I received quite a lot of game meat this
time.  
We've got some authentic sausages, which I think Berry-san and the
others will enjoy. That cooler over there is Wagyu beef."

"Oh... Krische, I'd love to try that sausage…"

"Alright, leave it to me.  
I'll start grilling those first."

"Fufu, thank you. We have some soup and appetizers ready, please help
yourselves."

"Thank you very much! Toba, Feni, let's get the fire going."

Ledo and Krische, excited by the food, began tending the grills.

"Their relationship is complicated.  
They depend on each other... but it seems unlikely they'll ever get
together. It's a tragic love story."

"Feni doesn't really like those sad ones…"

"But, even if they don't get together, if their hearts reach the same
destination, that could be considered a successful love. Even if not
everything is fulfilled, it may still be a happy relationship."

"I see…"

They discussed the new drama series, sampled the brought food, comparing
tastes and enjoying a relaxed barbecue.

After finishing the food and as evening approached, they enjoyed tea and
dessert.  
Shelna offered a magic show as entertainment.

Sensing a shift in the atmosphere, Selene exchanged glances with Berry
and complied.

"We're exorcists...  
Actually, our job is to hunt monsters known as Youma."

Shelna conjured several orbs of magical energy.  
The Nyururun looked confused.  
Selene felt awkward.  
Berry, sitting with Krische asleep on her lap, watched intently.

"We use magic like this to defeat demons who threaten people… it’s a job
that's been around since ancient times, even though the surface world
doesn't know about it."

"There's such a job... I'm surprised."

"Yes. We've been kind to you, so I wanted to be honest… to be open with
Berry-san and the others."

"Magical Berry, you know, right?"

The insect on Krische's sleeping head spoke. Several fairy cameramen,
initially few, had increased in number, and Selene was dumbfounded.  
Berry, caught in the middle, was distressed, her face betraying her
discomfort, her eyes shifting from side to side.  
She was about to speak…

"That, Shelna-sama…"

Shelna shook her head and smiled.

"It's fine. It's our situation… I'm not asking anything of Berry-san and
the others. I just wanted you to know."

"Know…"

"Yes. There are various Youma problems happening around here... If
anything happens, I want you to rely on us. That's all."

Shelna said this, appearing certain of something.  
Selene felt like their secret was completely out and looked at
Kreschenta, who was arms crossed, her expression relaxed and seemingly
approving.  
Kreschenta may have anticipated this.  
The insect's specialty was eavesdropping.

"Like us, there are magical girls in this land.  
You could say we're competitors.  
In the past, we cooperated against a common enemy… but now, we're
adversaries."

Shelna placed her hand on her chest, hesitant.  
Sensing the flash of cameras, Selene wanted to run away.  
Shelna was practically the heroine—just like Magical Berry in the
"Magical☆Berry Mu" series—and genuinely cared about Berry and the
others. Selene's chest ached with guilt and remorse.

"I believe there's a reason. The magical girl at the center has been
fighting secretly for many years… she's a very kind person. I'm sure she
has circumstances she can't reveal, forcing her into unwanted battles."

"Shelna-sama…"

"I want to save that magical girl… Magical Berry."

Shelna looked straight at Berry, who appeared on the verge of breaking
down.  
Countless flashes went off; this scene would undoubtedly be broadcast as
a highlight. Selene wanted to bow her head.  
But perhaps it would be better if they never knew the truth of this
grand prank.

"I wanted Berry-san to know that… I'm sorry, it's such a strange story…"

"No…"

"I'm saying this now, but… if you'd allow it, I'd like us to remain…
just slightly unusual neighbors."

Berry nodded, and Shelna and the others looked relieved. They all
smiled, reassured.

After some time, Shelna and her group left.

"Two destined to fight for world peace… but Shelna, the exorcist, having
learned the true identity of Magical Berry, can no longer see her as an
enemy.  
Despite being adversaries, knowing this, they desire to maintain a
peaceful coexistence, gradually reaching out to each other… that's the
plot."

On the living room coffee table, the insect perched on a newly purchased
miniature throne, declared.

"You…"

"Well… I feel a little better, but I knew I was being suspected, and tea
time was incredibly awkward…"

"You're remarkably bold to even drink tea calmly. I couldn’t even show
my face."

Sitting between Selene and Berry, Krische listened, looking
unconcerned.  
She probably wasn't thinking about anything at all.  
Selene pinched her cheek; she groaned, "Uu…"

"We can get good shots of everyday scenes from now on. The reason they
have to fight is, as I said before, to counter the invasion of the space
tentacles. They're pretending to be servants to buy time to seal the
space tentacles… The Nyururun are acting as servants to monitor the
space tentacles disguised as Magical Berry's servants."

The Nyururun straightened up with crisp movements, "Nyururu…"

"But they're torn between their duty as space tentacle monitors and
their loyalty to Magical Berry, knowing about the time-buying strategy
but remaining silent…  
it's a delicate situation.  
Please inform the other tentacles accordingly."

Nyururun saluted (moving its tentacles in a salute-like manner) with a
serious expression, and the other tentacles followed suit.  
Selene sighed.

"So, the setting is that we can seal the Cosmic Tentacle by using
Krische's life?  
There was narration like that in the game earlier,"

"That is why you and Magical Berry must fight. We are forced into an
unwanted battle to save our older sister."

"……We are indeed forced into an unwanted battle.  
Speaking of which, I completely forgot, but this child is supposed to
die if she uses her powers."

It was a setting added early on because Krische was too strong and not
interesting.

Honestly, the fights have become mostly playful, and I completely forgot
about it.

"Oh...and please add voice to the parts of the game where there's no
sound. I mostly used footage from the theatrical version."

"……Don't just arbitrarily use it in the first place. I absolutely hate
it."

"If you absolutely refuse, we'll have to change the scene so that I and
Magical Berry speak the relevant parts...it's pitiful. The people who
spent hundreds of hours working hard on those scenes while pulling
all-nighters...are on vacation right now."

"Um, well..."

It was the lowest of the low.  
They arbitrarily created things without prior consent, and if you
complained, they'd appeal to your conscience saying it would be unfair
to the staff involved.  
There's no fault in those who are used like slaves because they can't
defy this pest, and it's a statement made knowing that Selene is weak.

"W-well, well...I'm in the same boat, so let's do our best. It'll be fun
once we start."

"It's because of you that it's like this! You're spoiling this pest too
much."

"Don't call me a pest—s-spray is a no-no!"

After that discussion, it was bath time. While the impudent blonde was
bathing, she gave instructions to the fairies, and afterwards, she went
to the bathroom with her older sister and the redhead.  
In the older sister's hand, which was leaning on the redhead—they
relaxed in that small bathtub, letting the day's fatigue melt away.

"I'm so tired today..."

"……I feel like Kreschenta didn't really do anything."

"Onee-sama, physical labor isn't the only kind of work. I work hard
every day using my brain so that onee-sama won't be bothered by trivial
matters and can have fun cooking with Magical Berry here."

"Hmph…"

The older sister looked like she wanted to complain, but perhaps she
couldn't find the words and gave up.  
The redhead chuckled and asked.

"Hee hee. How's the water temperature?"

"It's fine…"

As if melting the day's fatigue away in the lukewarm water. As they did
so, their bodies relaxed, and they felt drowsy, approaching a deep
sleep.

"Fwa…Kreschenta, you can't sleep yet."

"I know, onee-sama…"

Hearing her older sister's sleepy voice, the redhead said it was time to
get out.  
Her wings and body were carefully wiped with a towel, and her hair was
combed while a hairdryer was used. Kreschenta decided that the redhead
deserved praise for things like this and her meals.  
After putting on her newly bought pajamas, the Princess Mimi-chan Royal
Room bed was brought from the living room.  
But she just lay down while still on the redhead's hand.  
The redhead's hand wasn't a bad bed.

A while later, when the two got into bed, the other hand was placed on
top of Kreschenta.

"Goodnight, Kreschenta-sama."

Listening to those words, she quietly drifted off to sleep. When the
hand opened again, one beautiful fairy was sleeping soundly.

"She's such a spoiled brat, Kreschenta."

Krische said, Berry laughed, and carefully put her into the small
miniature bed so as not to wake her.

"Hee hee, Berry, goodnight kiss."

Saying that, the silver-haired girl kissed and hugged her. Berry
giggled, her shoulders shaking, and fell asleep.

――A moment of peace. But the days of battle continue.

"W-wait. That means we can't seal Dark Energy with this...?"

"Hey! Magical Selene, stop the monotone reading. Are you doing it on
purpose?"

"S-shut up! It's incredibly embarrassing! Just doing the voices!"

"Young miss, do your best."

"Hee hee, Krische's cheering you on!"

"Imagination is key. Imagine the situation…"

"I'm doing that if I can! I'm not a voice actress or an actress!"

To banish the darkness that comes from the depths of space,

"Magical Selene, it's from the right this time. Look, you're taking
damage again…your counter-shield is too slow."

"The timing is too strict! It's clearly harder only for Magical Selene."

"I don't think so…if I or my older sister use it, we can clear it at the
fastest speed among all characters. But well, maybe we should lower the
operation difficulty a little more for people who are bad at games."

"This…"

"Nyururun, please summarize the play experience of all characters
later."

And so, even today, the magical girls continue to fight.

"I admire Magical Selene-san! I want your autograph…!"

"Just a moment, that's not allowed. Magical Selene's autograph isn't
free."

"E-uh…s-sorry."

"It's fine, it's a child's request…here you go."

"T-thank you!"

"We have the day off today, so don't tell anyone, okay?"

"Y-yes!"

Game making, autograph sessions, even their days off are for their
mission.

"It was an event too good for a single episode in the next season. Let's
add another theatrical version featuring the teamwork between Magical
Berry and the exorcist, Shelna."

"Understood. Then…we need a slightly bigger enemy that looks
impressive."

"That's right. Let's get the Cosmic Tentacle to help us prepare a
suitable monster. Apparently, you can cut up the tentacles and
manipulate them into various shapes."

"In that case. But what do we do? Do we hint that Magical Berry is at
odds with the tentacles, or do we make it a completely different enemy?"

"The severed pieces of the Cosmic Tentacle won't have much impact.  
It might be better to have a genuinely unrelated demon and make them
fight seriously for more tension?"

"I see, a surprise attack."

Even without succumbing to the shadows working in the background, they
protect the daily peace.

"Guh!?"

"Ledo! Feni, take care of Ledo's injuries…"

"Y-yes…"

"Shelna, evacuate Ledo for now. We can't handle this alone!"

"But…"

"Just go—"

"——Are you giving up already? Exorcist Shelna."

"M-Magical Berry! And Magical Selene too…!"

"Whoa, Magical Berry. That's seriously strong."

"That's right, let's go all out. Magical Selene, buy us some time."

"Got it!"

"Exorcist Shelna, can you fight?"

"……Yes!"

Whether their battles will ever end…

"You! What surprise attack? I almost died for real!"

"W-what are you doing!?  
No spray!"

No one knows that.

To be continued… (It won't be continued.)
