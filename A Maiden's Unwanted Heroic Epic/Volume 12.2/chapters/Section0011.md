# Chapter 321 - Responsibility End

Three months of my stay ended, and my interactions with the Kreisharana
continued smoothly thereafter.  
I had scholars examine the land and tried to establish new seedlings
there.  
Since they only accept things like alcohol and daily necessities, I
brought skilled artisans and scholars.

Alberan's rich technology has been refined through many cultural
exchanges. While their closed-off approach to technological advancement
has resulted in impressive skills, the Alberan blacksmiths, carpenters,
and scholars possess even broader knowledge.

Even if they couldn't fight, these individuals dedicated their lives to
the pursuit of knowledge and skill.  
Alberan gained its collective strength based on their dedication.  
Whether directly or indirectly, despite differences in battlefields,
they, too, are warriors worthy of respect, a fact the Kreisharana
gradually began to accept.

Those who dedicate themselves to knowledge or skill are no different
from those who dedicate themselves to swords and spears.  
A certain old blacksmith declared boldly, that if his sword was dull, he
would kill himself by thrusting the blade into his own body. A scholar
also calmly declared, laughing, that if his proposed method was wrong,
he didn't mind being killed.  
While they might not be considered retainers by Kreisharana standards,
the voices disparaging such individuals quickly faded.

Their unwavering beliefs, determination, and pride in their
self-cultivation – it was precisely their aversion to ostentation and
emphasis on inner strength that allowed the Kreisharana to understand
them. If people have any superiority, it resides within the heart; it is
never external.

Their valuing of those who cannot fight was essential in that harsh
land; otherwise, survival would be impossible. Their culture is
synonymous with life, and no one can question its rightness or
wrongness.

But things are different now. They no longer need to be isolated in that
harsh land. The option of moving to a more habitable land is now a
possibility for their future. They can find meaning beyond combat, be
needed, and be allowed to take pride.  
Argosh wanted to convey the potential of such a future.

'With someone like Krische-sama appearing, someone like Her Majesty
appearing, and someone like you appearing… we will surely perish slowly.
But Giterns-dono need not worry.  
We will perish of our own accord,' Vinthril said.

'And, like Giterns-dono, who was born outside, if there are those who
cherish us and find our way of life beautiful… even in the future after
our extinction, our way of life will surely be passed down in some
form.  
As long as it is needed, by someone's hand.'

Argosh thought them to be strong people, accepting their demise with a
laugh. To avoid them regretting this, Argosh runs around tirelessly.

Day after day, he continued his interactions with the Kreisharana,
exchanging numerous letters.  
Leaving the management of the territory to his grown sons, he enjoyed
busy yet fulfilling days – until one day, two books arrived from Anne:

"At the Manor of the Noble Hawk…"

Beautifully bound in thick black leather with silver thread embroidery –
two volumes.  
The delivery man only said that it was a request from Anne; there was no
letter in the package.  
While puzzled by the forgotten letter, Argosh wondered why she would
send books specifically to him, typical of his daughter’s eccentric
ways.  
He pondered this on the sofa in his private room.

Were they particularly good books that warranted sending them all this
way?  
If so, that would be understandable. Though not a particularly avid
reader, Argosh collected various books for his studies, and he often
read when staying home. The mansion has a rather impressive library, and
Anne might have misunderstood that he was a book lover.  
Choosing books as a gift for her father isn’t unusual.  
In fact, some servants thought he liked books, and he was objectively a
reader.

Rather, he just read books as a form of learning and cultivation.  
If asked if he liked books, he couldn't say yes, but if asked if he
disliked them, he'd say no.  
He’s more of a book lover – and if it's a gift from his daughter, he's
curious about what kind of books they are.

“You, what does the letter say—…?”

With black bean tea and cookies on a tray, his wife, Reina, returned and
tilted her head, gazing at the book in Argosh’s hands.  
Her tea-colored hair hung loosely in front of her neck. Although showing
some signs of aging, she was still a lovely and charming wife, his pride
and joy.  
Dressed in a simple navy blue one piece dress, even as the wife of the
Marquis Giterns, she still baked cookies herself and worked tirelessly
in the kitchen and laundry, just as she did during her servant days.

Argosh had tried to stop her from doing so much, saying that she was his
wife now, but she seemed uncomfortable not being busy – ultimately
Argosh gave in.  
He himself had been attracted to her hard-working and caring nature.
Seeing the unchanging Reina calmed him, and he left matters of his daily
life to his wife.

This upbringing might have had a significant impact on Anne.  
While thinking so, he showed her the books, and she chuckled at the fact
that only books had been sent.

"She must have forgotten the letter," she said.

"That's probably it. Typical Anne."

"Heh, even serving beside Her Majesty, she hasn't changed her
absent-mindedness."

Relaxing her mouth, she picked up the second volume and lightly checked
the contents, then frowned.

"……This… is that child’s handwriting?"

"Anne’s?"

Finally, he opened the book, and the first thing that caught his eye was
the table of contents:

Prologue – Anne of the Giterns family, up to becoming a royal household
servant.

Chapter One – Ideals and Realities. And the Eternal Goal, an Encounter
with a Great Servant.

Chapter Two – The Royal War and the Noble Hawk Princesses.

Chapter Three –

Argosh was stunned.

Was this an autobiography or something?  
Imagining his daughter confidently sending him a mysterious
autobiography, he found it absurd but ultimately accepted it.  
Anne had a tendency to do unpredictable things. According to Reina, she
sometimes had deep thoughts (though sometimes it's just a whim), but
even Argosh, having watched her since infancy, found it difficult to
understand her heart.

The handwriting was definitely Anne's.  
Her somewhat meticulous handwriting was neat and tidy. It was not
inferior to that of a professional calligrapher.

However, handwriting reveals one's personality. During the civil war,
the handwriting of the letter sent to Argosh about Anne was from Selene,
the daughter of the Christand family. Her strong and resolute script
conveyed the bravery and strong will of a noble lady.

The handwriting of the head servant, Berry, who had written letters on
her behalf several times, was elegant, refined, and delicate. The permit
that Alberinea had once entrusted to Kreisharana was almost identical to
Berry's, likely copied by Berry's apprentice.

Queen Kreschenta's handwriting was befitting a queen. Her vivid and
beautiful handwriting, clearly expressing the variations in speed and
strength, was beautiful, but it also subtly reflected her personality.

Anne's handwriting, as expected, conveyed her meticulous nature.  
While beautiful, a slightly vain aspect trying to create a stylish
script shone through; it wasn't a natural habit like the other four, but
rather her efforts to create this beauty.  
It was charmingly characteristic of Anne.

The title section was powerful and bold, like Selene's, while
descriptions of others' virtues were flamboyant, like Kreschenta's.  
Her usual script imitated Berry's elegance but with a slightly awkward,
strained imitation of fluidity. It was oddly fascinating to see Anne's
strong preferences through her writing.

However, the contents became more worrisome the more he read.  
It spoke about the people he had met since heading toward the royal
territory, primarily focusing on the Christand family.  
Basically, everything was nothing but praise.  
While the descriptions of their personalities weren't bad, statements
like Berry being small but with a full bust and a beautiful waistline,
or Selene having a slender body as alluring as a supple cat, left Argosh
bewildered.  
He understood the compliments on their appearances, but these sentences
were unnecessary.  
The inclusion of the royals, the Queen and Alberinea, made him even more
worried about Anne.

"That girl really…"

"Typical Anne…"

Reina, who had been looking over Argosh's shoulder, chuckled as he held
his head in his hands.  
She had understood their personalities to some extent when she had met
them, and she had seen how kind and affectionate they were toward Anne.
The more she learned about their lives and personalities from the book,
the more she understood how much Anne loved them, and how much they
cherished Anne.  
This meant she wouldn't be angry or punish Anne for this book, but the
content was still terrifying – and certainly not for public view.

The second volume was even more extreme.

'Her Majesty, as usual, sat on Argan-sama's lap, mimicking a dog and
acting spoiled—'

Such strange, unusual events were casually described amidst the daily
occurrences, leaving Argosh to decide that the book should be sealed or
burned, yet he couldn't stop reading.  
He compulsively turned the pages, captivated by Anne's feelings woven
into the chaotic daily life within the manor.

Considering why she described her life from birth to her daily life in
the manor so joyfully, he came to understand the reason behind the
book's creation.

"I should start preparing dinner…  
I'll read the rest later."

"Ah, go ahead."

Even after Reina left, he continued turning the pages. The written
content was only a small fragment.  
He read on, imagining the interactions happening between the lines.

Berry's stabbing, and the dull routine before Krische returned with a
dragon.  
The hardships and worries of the Five Great Nation War were mentioned,
and because the daily life was described so brightly and humorously,
these serious events stood out even more. Toward the end, much was
described about Gallen, Krische's adoptive grandfather, and Argosh
started to understand.

The old man Anne admired, frequently mentioned in daily life. A true
genius, admired by Krische, and evaluated highly by many soldiers, a
hunter-turned-warrior. He was around the same age as Argosh – just not a
magic user.  
This book, written as a letter, was likely prompted by him. Argosh had
heard of his recent death.

Anne described the words she learned from him, and the things he taught
her, as precious treasures, and these accounts became more frequent
towards the end of the book. When she wrote about Gallen's death, Anne
finally explained the purpose of the book.

She stated that although born to admirable parents and surrounded by
wonderful people, she felt like an ordinary person compared to them.
Then she mentioned Argosh’s words and her considerations about her
future. A happy future of marrying a good man, starting a family, and
raising children was certainly possible, and unlike the others, she was
just an ordinary woman.  
She wondered if she was unfit to spend her life in this glamorous world.

‘Gallen said that I, being a common person, am a special person in this
glamorous world, and that I am very important to this manor. He said
that one doesn't always have to tighten the bowstring, but that someone
is needed to sometimes loosen it... because everyone in this manor tends
to overtighten the strings,'

The daily life depicted is like an illustrated story.  
The Queen's elder sister and the Queen, worthy of being called children
of God. A servant who spoiled these two like children. A noble lady who
became a marshal at fifteen and fulfilled her role naturally. Even her
rival among the servants is exceptionally talented, and everyone
associated with them naturally possessed something extraordinary.

‘Argan-sama also says that I always receive help, despite being
incapable of doing anything, and she always lets me do what I want
without worrying. She laughs and says that someone is needed who
sometimes angers and troubles their master. I don't know if she meant
the same thing, but she said this to me,’

Her heart was the same. Anne had many flaws, but Argosh was proud of his
daughter.  
These people saw the good in Anne.

‘I don't think I'm a worthy person, like the ones mentioned, who's
needed by someone. I think they are comforting me and reassuring me, but
I still hope that there is a truth that I don't know, even if it's a
little bit. I want to believe, even just a little bit, that someone like
me can be useful to them,’

As he had suspected, this was a farewell letter.  
A letter demonstrating her decision about her future life.

‘Of course, I might just be foolishly mistaken. I might end up being
thoroughly disgusted with and eventually kicked out of the manor. But
until that day comes, I will serve those I admire and do everything I
can in this manor—’

And because of that sentence:

‘I wish to fulfill my duty as a servant.’

Argosh pressed his fingers against his eyes.

‘Father, who is still risking your life in a faraway land, doing a
difficult task. Mother, who taught me many things kindly and watched
over me. And my brothers, I might cause you much worry. But as one of
the nobles born into the Giterns family, who have inherited our family
name, I swear to uphold this precious name for eternity,’

—Please forgive your selfish daughter.

Imagining Anne's face and hearing her words of determination, he bowed
his head.  
He couldn't hold back his tears, which streamed down his nose.

‘With love, from the Manor of the Noble Hawk, Anne Giterns, child of my
admired father and mother.’

Upon reading those final words, he pressed his sleeve against his eyes.
A knock came, Reina called him to dinner.  
She came over to him and patted his head with a wry smile, saying,
"What's wrong with you, at your age?"

"……Read it later," he said.

"Yes…was it something sad?"

He shook his head, sniffed, and looked up.

"Above all, it's joyous news. ...As the head of the Giterns family, it
is my greatest pride."

He closed the book and traced the lettering on the cover.

"As a father, I feel a little lonely...that's the kind of letter it is."

"...So it is."

In the noble hawk's mansion—and now, from the noble hawk's mansion.

"Let's go when you've settled down. The food will get cold."

"Ah, I'm sorry."

Having left the mansion where she grew up, Anne is now within it.

The next day, he wrote a letter, and Argosh returned to his daily
routine.  
He energetically ran around various places, meeting scholars, craftsmen,
and merchants, acting as a bridge between the mansion and Kreisharana,
traveling back and forth.

The round trip took too long, causing concern, and after a while, a
warrior stayed at Argosh's mansion, partly to study the culture of the
plains. Flying from the foot of the mountain, one could reach
Kreisharana in less than half a day.  
While it wasn't feasible with a large group, they gradually became more
cooperative, with several warriors offering to escort smaller groups,
making things much more pleasant.

During the large project of cooperating with the Alberan army—creating a
road between Alberan and Kreisharana—they suffered damage from magical
beasts, causing Argosh stomach aches. But when tired, he would look at
the book Anne had given him, rereading the words written within, and
renewing his spirits.

The Queen wasn't entirely hands-off either. During major projects,
Alberinea, riding her Suiko, would occasionally appear with a carefree
demeanor, solving difficult problems as if they were nothing, then
depart, saying she had busy work at the mansion.

Some time later, the Stormwing was hunted, also at Anne’s urging and as
a courtesy to Kreisharana.  
In just half a day, nearly ten beasts near the planned road were
hunted.  
Seeing Alberinea solve problems that had Argosh racking his brain with
what seemed like "little errands," he sometimes wondered if his presence
even mattered. But still, Argosh had no choice but to stubbornly fulfill
his duty.

Feeling the immensity of Alberinea and the Queen's presence made him
understand his own insignificance.  
Berry, beloved and cherished by them, and Selene, who naturally fits in
as the mistress of the mansion where such women reside.  
They were literally above the clouds, inhabitants of a story world.
Thinking of his beloved daughter's daily life spent with them, and
thinking of Anne Giterns, who had vowed to make it her duty, there was
no room in his life for self-debasement.

A proud daughter, a father worthy of pride.  
Just as Anne strove to fulfill her duty, he would do the same.  
He turned the pages of the book so often that the pages were worn from
use.

He responded to that letter as a nobleman.

"I cannot allow any more of these unpublishable forbidden books to be
added to the collection."  
Most of the letter was a rebuke to Anne, telling her to improve her
demeanor as a servant of Her Majesty the Queen, repeatedly warning her
never to write anything like that again. And finally,

'Above all, I earnestly hope that Anne Giterns will fulfill her duty.
Even from afar, as a fellow nobleman who bears the Giterns name, as a
father who strives to fulfill his duty with his proud daughter.'

—In the noble hawk’s mansion, written with love for the servants who
will read this.

He would recall these words every time he turned the page, renewing his
resolve.

He was an ordinary, insignificant person.  
But that was no reason to abandon his duty.

He was himself. Whether talented or not, everyone fulfills the duties
commensurate with their given abilities. The Queen has her duties,
Alberinea has hers. No matter how blessed they were, no matter how
easily they could solve the problems of many, it made no difference.  
Each surely had their hardships and tribulations, which is why they
risked their lives even against dragons.

To give their all for something more important than themselves.  
There is no superiority or inferiority in that.

He would face it stubbornly and sincerely, regardless of shame or
ridicule.  
Even if it was unsightly or pathetic, he would still dedicate his
efforts and proudly proclaim it.

"Do you like showing off your foolishness, you idiot? How many times
have you been thrown around? You have no sense, and your movements are
slow. No matter how many years I work with you, it's the same thing over
and over... If it's too painful and you want to quit, you can whine all
you want."

"No, please give me another chance, Dukaran-dono."

"Then move your body before you move your mouth. Whether it's a cowardly
surprise attack or whatever, desperately take even one point from me.
Even if you show your foolishness and crawl, I'll praise you if you get
results."

"Yes, sir."

That was his duty, he declared proudly, with a laugh.

※Stormwing Extermination

"...The Stormwing's nest is on this cliff face."

Above the Stormwing's nest—silver hair resting on Vinthril's back.  
Krische looked down with a "ho-oh."

The Stormwing's nest was located in a large hollow at the top of a high,
overhanging cliff.  
In the depths of a huge crack in the cliff face, like a gaping maw, the
Stormwing slept peacefully.

It was said that this place wasn't originally a cliff but a mountain,
sculpted by the fighting of dragons.  
Indeed, from the opposite side, the cliff face was a complete mountain,
and there were traces of rock melt on the cliff face.  
Probably the hollow was also caused by this.  
For hundreds of years, they hadn't been able to understand why even the
Stormwing, which should have been killed once, made this its base,
whether it was due to some unknown reason or its intelligence.

Approaching the cliff top slowly from above to avoid detection, Vinthril
explained:

"I hear that in ancient times, there were brave warriors who went
directly into the nest.  
However, the large crack in the cliff face, like a gaping maw...the
distance to the Stormwing's sleeping chamber was quite far, and they
were unable to approach because of its wingbeats and were
counter-attacked..."

"Wingbeats..."

"Literally, like a storm that sweeps away the forest.  
It is surely inferior to that of Yagernaus-sama, but still, with a human
body, there was no way to cope with the storm that would arise in that
confined space. ...At that time, the Stormwing, awakened and enraged,
caused great damage to the village."

"I see...That's quite something."

It wouldn't be easy to defeat the Stormwing inside that nest. For the
Stormwing, which could unleash a storm with a single wingbeat, this wide
and deep crack in the cliff face was a perfect environment to easily
counter-attack any intruder.  
It could even fling its opponent into the air with one of its wingbeats.

He knew about Krische's godlike skill that could rival even a holy
spirit, but it was too dangerous to enter.  
First, Vinthril and the others would act as bait and somehow lure the
Stormwing out of the nest—and then they would finish it off the moment
it exposed itself outside the cliff face.  
That would likely be the best solution.

"Yes. So we'll be the bait—"

"Then, Krische, Krische’ll be going now."

"K-Krische-sama!?"

Before they could stop her.  
Krische, gripping her spear, jumped off the near-vertical cliff face as
if it were nothing.

—Did she even listen to what they said?  
Stunned, Vinthril and the others mounted their griffins and hastily made
a steep descent, but they couldn't catch up, and—

"—"!?"

The moment Krische's hand grabbed the top edge of the crack and she
disappeared into it, a monstrous bird's cry that froze their insides
echoed—and then it abruptly ceased, followed by a ground-shaking thud.  
What Vinthril and the others finally saw, having caught up, was the
monstrous bird, its head and neck severed, collapsing in the depths of
the enormous crack, its wings spread.  
And Krische, adjusting her skirt, tilting her head.

"Krische heard you, but it's pretty big, isn't it?  
Hmm, Krische wonders if it's delicious..."

—A gentle breeze stroked Vinthril's cheeks.

※Magical Beast Hunt

Above the mountains, on a griffin—Krische was riding sideways behind
Lila, holding her spear while looking down.

"Ah, there they are again. Lila, a little further back."

"Y-yes...Lernel."

What exactly was she seeing?  
Lila watched as Krische, still seated, threw her spear downwards at a
terrifying speed. The spear disappeared into the gaps in the trees,
followed by the scream of a Suiko. The trees shook and fell as if being
tossed around, then the commotion subsided.

"The sway made Krische’s aim a little off.  
Krische’s sorry for that."

"I-I'm sorry..."

"No, it was just Krische being clumsy. Um, that one over
there...Ranka.  
Krische’s taken it down, so please take care of the bloodletting and
butchering."

"U-Understood..."

"Hmm, anything else..."

While speaking to the bewildered Lion-Griffin knights, she swung her
legs back and forth.

—That day, one Ranka and seven Suikos vanished from the mountain.
