# Chapter 322 - The threat lurking in the depths

AN: This is a diversionary future IF. It's pretty rough, so if you don't
like the worldview being destroyed (

—---

I knew the story that this earth is a large, round sphere.

—Just what kind of world is this?  
The various theories were brought to an end by Queen Grabareine of
Alberan. Astrology, which uses the movement of stars to predict the
future—in the Alberan region of the past, the positions and movements of
stars were believed to indicate good or bad omens, influencing various
aspects of this world.  
Therefore, at that time, such astrology was considered an important
factor in political decision-making, and she silenced it by
theoretically demonstrating, through calculations of orbits and physical
laws, that this world is one star floating in a vast space—the universe.

A vast world and stars connected by gravity and centrifugal force.  
Nothing could refute Grabareine, who had clarified the mystery as
physics, and the mystery of astrology was lost, while her theory
continues to be used as the foundation of astronomy today.

Grabareine probably wasn't interested in space.  
She only clarified it because it was necessary. Although she created a
perfect foundation, she didn't continue further, and astronomical
research was treated more like a hobby for amateurs.  
Berry thought so too, and didn't have a strong interest in conducting
such research, but looking at the outline of the universe drawn on
parchment on her desk, her heart still fluttered.

"I see…it's an unbelievably vast size."

In the room, there were Selene and Berry sitting on the sofa, and
Krische and Kreschenta sitting on top of each other.  
It was the usual sight; including Elvena, who stood by, their gazes were
directed at the desk.

"That's because your intellect is inferior."

"…Yes, you're right—"

"Honestly, you can't even do simple calculations properly; it's
infuriating.  
Must I teach you from basic arithmetic? I went to the trouble of
explaining it to you, and your conclusion is that it's unbelievably
vast?  
That's incredibly stupid—"

"…Woof."

"W-what was that…?"

Berry, keeping a smile on her face, stuffed a cookie into Kreschenta's
mouth to silence her.

"Mmmph…"

"Woof, that's it, Kreschenta-sama."

Then, she ruffled her hair as if she were a dog, deepening her smile.  
Ignoring Selene's exasperated gaze, Berry lowered her gaze to the
parchment.  
Countless beautiful circles were drawn, which would not be thought
possible with a freehand drawing; it conceptually depicted the world
from around this star and beyond. Large celestial bodies and small
celestial bodies, countless celestial bodies drawing spirals, floating
in the endless void.  
Noticing Elvena also peering at the parchment, she asked.

"Do you like it too, Elvena-san?"

"Yes, it's very interesting. I don't know anything about astronomy…"

Elvena also answered with curiosity in her eyes.

"Fufu, I'm not that knowledgeable either…but it's fun to imagine various
things.  
With so many stars, I wonder if there are aliens?"

"…Aliens?"

"Yes, just as we were born by chance, other people might have been born
by chance…considering the number of stars and years, it doesn't seem
impossible."

"I see, yes. Insects and fish, lizards and snakes…there might even be
intelligent plants."

As they chuckled together and Berry fed Kreschenta cookies, Krische, who
had been drowsy on Selene, asked.

"Does Berry want to see aliens?"

"Yes…well, more like I find it fun to imagine."

"I see…hehe, I hope there are.  
Aliens—"

I hope there are, aliens—the voice of a small creature on a small
planet. A sound that would normally disappear in an instant in the
boundless void.

In that conversation, the small creature realized there was a hole in
its own 'security,' rewriting the network etched into the root world and
expanding that network. The Fuyopita Net—later called the Aether Limit,
a world law that closes the path to the root and sets a limit on magical
inscription. It restricted the rapidly advancing power of magic, causing
and suppressing magical disturbances in large-scale descriptions that
exceeded a certain range.  
It was a 'rule' engraved in the deepest part of the world to prevent the
collapse of the world due to powerful magic.

And so, the voice of the girl who communicated with the root
unintentionally became part of the network.  
—I hope my beloved servant enjoys it.  
Such an unconscious wish echoed from the root to the unbelievably vast
world of stars.

I hope there are, aliens—

From the root to the root.  
Along with the expanding network, it distorts spacetime, and the voice
propagates through the void world. From star to star, as if to fill the
endless void one by one.

I hope there are, aliens—

A journey to the root that transcends spacetime. The network fills the
discrepancy in distance with time, simply going farther. While riding
the spacetime ripples as if going back in time to the universe, it
advances through the void before life proliferated on their star, simply
following the assigned process.

—I hope there are, aliens—I hope there are, aliens—I hope there are,
aliens—I hope there are, aliens—I hope there are, aliens—I hope there
are, aliens—I hope there are, aliens—I hope there are, aliens—From the
distorting root of spacetime, the voice reaches the incredibly distant
past.

"Kararararara"

The planet Minardoria, later called the seventh planet of the Minarsi
system. The lizard-like creatures inhabiting it felt something like a
wave piercing their bodies for a moment and raised their heads.

"Kararararararara?"

"Kara"

While communicating through cries, they quickly forgot about the wave.  
However, something decisively different was engraved deep within them.

—Adjusting and irradiating negative mass generative tachyon particles.  
Reflecting the enemy's precise current position by filling in the
temporal discrepancies, a wormhole is immediately formed and
infiltrated.  
Simultaneously with the warp-out, a torrent of energy that could turn a
star into a dead planet in a matter of days is released from the
fleet.  
The vast energy supplied from the collapse furnace produces
instantaneous destruction and light through a giant particle
accelerator, sweeping away and annihilating the enemy in front.

One-hit-and-run warp. In battles set in the vast universe, such tactics
were the main focus. Warp out to the front of the enemy, who is
light-years away, perform a barrage of fire while jet-propelling. After
breaking through to the rear of the enemy, form a wormhole again and
warp to gain distance.

Energy shield, wormhole formation, close-range defense fire.  
In the huge bridge with a crew of five hundred, all of this is handled
collectively, and countless voices conveying various reports fly back
and forth. The ones shouting are reptilian-like creatures.  
Lizard-like faces, with two magnificent horns on their temples. They
have no scales but grayish skin with a dull luster, and their bodies are
tightly covered from head to tail by a purple suit with a rubber-like
texture.  
Apart from the silver metal protectors on their chests, groins, feet and
gauntlets, they are relatively simple, and they move their four
rubber-covered fingers, freely manipulating the floating holographic
display.

The engineering-form fleet passes through a dangerous space creature
species, a group of cosmic amoebas.  
Hideous monsters that digest and multiply organic matter—the swarm of
Arnias.  
Even one slipping through could easily flatten a star.  
Perhaps they learned some wisdom in the long war despite their low
intelligence; they were becoming similar in shape to our fleet. They
freely merge and separate, and if they grow huge, they far exceed the
combat ships in this fleet that accommodate ten thousand personnel.
Using an unknown method, they form particle accelerator cannons inside,
and once they break through the ship's shield and attach themselves to a
vessel, they easily break through the nano-coated high-density armor and
infiltrate the ship, multiplying.

Not a single one must be allowed to approach.  
Most of those deployed in front are incinerated with the main cannon at
the head of the ship, and while scattering secondary cannons to maintain
the breakthrough point horizontally and vertically, the fleet passes
through the center.

"98.7% of the Arnias have been destroyed! 18,375 individuals remain!"

"Good, cease warp-out and switch to extermination.  
All ships turn, launch Fortresses."

Shouting from the unusually large chair in the center is Millgangga, the
commander of the 237th Expeditionary Fleet. His forehead horns are
adorned with gold and jewels, and he wears cloth instead of a suit. The
inside of the coat draped over his body from both shoulders emits a
faintly warm light. —It is a heater that warms the body.

The Minarsi, who call themselves the rulers of the galaxy, are primates
with strong bodies and rich intellect—but they have the weakness of
being extremely sensitive to temperature changes.

They fall into a state of hibernation when they get cold.

Therefore, their suits are designed to keep their body temperature
constant at all times, but this is only a minimum level of insulation,
far from comfortable.  
They are extremely averse to cold, but due to their species'
characteristics, when they are warm, they fall into a state of mental
relaxation—in short, they become indolent.

Overcoming such racial characteristics, keeping their body warmly
heated, and yet maintaining a firm attitude as a commander, Millgangga's
appearance should be called that of a great hero. Everyone directed
their respectful gaze toward his courage.

The fleet turns—along with the instructions, numerous carrier-based
aircraft take off for the extermination of the remaining enemies.  
The latest model, the Fortress, a brainwave link-direct type aircraft,
scatters particle accelerator cannons from both arms, destroying the
remaining small Arnias with erratic maneuvers that ignore inertia.  
Since it's an aircraft for planetary conquest, its three legs (two feet
and a tail) were dead weight, but due to the brainwave link device, its
movement was not bad.  
The Arnias' bewildered appearance was clearly visible from the
surroundings.

"I thought it was just a toy, but it's not bad. Technology officer,
bring me the combat data later."

"Yes!"

"However…"

Millgangga turns his face sideways.  
There is a small Minarsi—its gray skin is balding in several places,
indicating that its lifespan is nearing its end.

"That was dangerous. I didn't expect them to have spread this far. If
the permission had been delayed, even the jewels you speak of might have
been consumed by them."

"Yes, exactly as you say…But what wonderful leadership, a victory
without any casualties. Such a large swarm…If it weren't for
Millgangga-sama's fleet, what would have become of us?"

"If you're surprised by this, you'd have your tail cut off just by
seeing the Hive Conquest battle. In the old Kudas conquest battle, there
were ten thousand times more—"

'Data reconciliation; 135,347 times.'

"The details are fine.  
Well, that's about how many Arnias there were."

Chuckling at the AI, Millgangga continues.

"I don't even want to imagine.  
The Hive that completely swallowed a planet…In that conquest battle, my
grandchildren and great-grandchildren—ten people—devoted themselves to
the Minarsi."

"Many died.  
In that battle, it would be easier to find those who didn't lose family
members. Including those who lived in Kudas."

Millgangga closes his eyes as he reaches out to touch his right horn,
and the elderly Minarsi, Gilyurya, also closes his eyes.  
For them, this was a prayer.

"After the extermination is complete, conduct an ultra-long-range search
again. If there are no problems, warp-hole entry will be in thirty-two
Minarsi standard hours. Gilyurya, take a break and compile the data from
Venua. I want to confirm it one more time before arrival."

"Yes. Understood, Millgangga-sama."

Residential areas and artificial celestial body residential areas that
completely cover the star.  
The Supergalactic Minarsi Empire has established many celestial
structures outside the planet and has developed.  
But no matter how far they go, it's an artificial land.  
Many Minarsi have a longing for a real land—a habitable natural planet.

Adjusting the orbital and rotational speeds by colliding ice celestial
bodies, including ice meteorites.  
Moving the stars to a survival zone, giving them abundant water,
planting trees—terraforming was being carried out on many planets
sequentially.  
However, even with the technological level to completely remake a star
system, it takes a long time to turn a single planet into a habitable
planet.  
Currently, 90% of the population live in artificial residential
areas—most of them die without ever setting foot on real land.

It is certain that there are many undiscovered habitable planets in the
universe, but the universe is an immense world.  
Even if we have a means of transportation far exceeding the speed of
light, no matter how many exploration ships we send, we are an extremely
insignificant existence. Even if their number reaches several hundred
billion, it is merely a tiny speck of dust in the universe.  
Natural habitable planets are not easy to find.

"Millgangga-sama. Warp-out complete near planet Venua, coordinates
specified, space stabilization complete.  
No abnormalities in any ships."

"….Hmm. I want to see it directly. Release the shielding."

"Yes!"

The front shielding, which had been closed for warp navigation.  
The bridge's protective wall opened to the sides, revealing a small,
jewel-like celestial body. Seeing it, Millgangga widened his eyes and
wagged his tail back and forth.

"This…is Venua.  
How beautiful…"

It was one of the celestial bodies that had been confirmed a short time
ago.  
Abundant water resources.  
Covered in green, and beneath it, there will be many mineral
resources—the jewel of the universe, planet Venua.  
Like Millgangga, many people saw it and wagged their tails. They don't
have expressions, but their emotions show up in their tails.  
Many were overwhelmed by the beauty of planet Venua and were overjoyed.

—The Minarsi took to space and obtained the technology to travel the
world of stars a long time ago.  
At times, they have fought wars with similar space civilizations,
consuming entire rich star systems for a mere single star.  
However, if you look outwards, the universe is vast, you realize it in
the depths of your heart.  
In the face of such a beautiful planet, it seems almost comical how
small a world we have been fighting in. The universe is truly
overflowing with countless stars.

A blue ether covers Venua, adding shades of color to the planet's
green.  
Despite having encountered many astonishing opponents, when viewing the
ultimate beauty of this celestial body, there is still an awe of the
divine felt in the horns.  
He remembers something that should be called a god, something that had
been lost due to scientific technology, and closes his eyes, touching
his right horn.

"…What you actually see is different from the data."

"Yes, indeed.  
That I was able to bring Millgangga-sama to this planet in my lifetime
is the greatest honor…the pride of my life."

The small lizard standing beside him—Gilyurya—trembles his tail and his
eyes are wet.

"Gilyurya. I'll tell His Majesty about your work from me. …A golden horn
is sure to be granted."

"Yes. Thank you for your kind words."

The Minarsi are all ruled by the Supergalactic King Minarshea.  
Basically, only royals like Millgangga, or those who have been
recognized for great achievements, are allowed to have decorations on
their horns. The golden horn is inferior to the jeweled horn of someone
like Millgangga, but it is the greatest honor for commoners—it is given
to those whose contributions are to be recorded in Minarsi history.

But this planet Venua is worthy of it.  
Abundant water resources, a stable climate, and the gravitational ratio
is almost the same as their home planet, Minardoria, and the oxygen
concentration is also very close.  
There are only a few examples in history where Minarsi can land on a
planet without needing terraforming, even without protective suits.

Gilyurya is a well-known exploration technologist.  
Knowing his achievements in the discovery of this planet Venua, no one
will oppose giving him the honor of a golden horn.

"As planned, we'll deploy the advance party tomorrow. Girylya, this is
the planet you found. You'll be on the first ship."

"……Is that alright?"

"Yes. It's inhabited by a pre-spacefaring civilization. There shouldn't
be any danger… but don't go wandering around too much."

"Y-yes!"

Girylya closed his eyes as if overcome with emotion, wagging his tail.
Millgangga laughed as he watched him.

Planet Venua is home to a variety of creatures, but among them, a
bipedal intelligent species called the Venua people has been identified.
They are organic lifeforms and a type of warm-blooded animal. They
reproduce sexually, giving birth to live young.  
—To the Minarsi, they were a closely related species. Considering the
silicon-based lifeforms, gas-based lifeforms, celestial-scale cosmic
beings, and amoebas that travel through space independently—lifeforms
that defy common sense—such beings evoked a sense of kinship.

Drone-based ecological surveys were largely complete. Their vision is
based on light. They possess hearing and smell, and their sensory organs
are largely similar to the Minarsi's.  
They are capable of relatively advanced conversation through
vocalizations. While they cannot sense heat like the Minarsi,
surprisingly, a significant portion of them can perceive and manipulate
psychokinetic particles—aether.  
The reason for their technological stagnation, despite their relatively
advanced society, is likely this.

Aether, while seemingly useful, has low scalability due to the existence
of an aether limit—instability during large-scale use—and it does not
lead to technological advancement capable of, say, traversing the
galaxy. While its daily use is certainly convenient, it is speculated
that this convenience has hindered the development of other scientific
technologies among them.

And a low technological level limits the world.  
Currently, there is no unified government, and multiple nations are
engaged in territorial disputes. It was reminiscent of the time when the
Minarsi were still crawling around their home planet.  
High-rise buildings stand tall, low-level projectile weapons using
aether as a firing mechanism are used on battlefields, and spacefaring
technology is also primitive.  
Several debris-filled "toys" were observed in orbit, but it will be a
long time before they can colonize other planets.

They likely believe this single planet is their entire world.  
Establishing a symbiotic relationship with them, who have yet to even
achieve planetary unification, will be difficult, but it is the
responsibility of the pioneers of civilization, their predecessors.

The fact that many intelligent lifeforms have been lifted up, protected,
and managed, is of course, due to the Minarsi's own interests and
economic reasons, but not only that.  
Space is full of dangerous lifeforms and species with whom communication
is impossible. Amoebas like the Alnia, while lacking intelligence, move
instinctively, consuming organic matter and repeatedly dividing—a single
fragment of such a being could easily destroy a civilization like this
and swallow it whole.  
Technological enlightenment is essential to deal with such problems.

And the universe still holds many problems that even the Minarsi cannot
solve. If these beings, who can perceive and manipulate psychokinetic
particles through sensation, reach the same level as themselves and
forge a cooperative relationship, it may be possible to find a solution
to several existing cosmic-scale problems. The richness of the stars,
the species that inhabit them; they must be placed under their
protection before other hands reach them.

Besides strange lifeforms, there are countless barbarians in the
universe who plot the subjugation of other species, even closely related
ones.  
It's fortunate that we reached them before they fell into the hands of
such beings.

The next step is the means—currently, Venua doesn't possess powerful
weapons capable of breaching our ships' shields.  
A simultaneous descent to the main areas of the planet, to intimidate
them, should be enough to bring them to the negotiating table.  
The use of force should be minimized as intimidation, and we should
avoid destroying their culture as much as possible.  
While contemplating the future, an alarm blared.

"Wh-…!?"

'High-density aether entity detected in the first bridge. I repeat, a
high-density aether entity detected in the first bridge—'

Before long, a Venua person with long silver fur (on her head)—a small,
female intelligent lifeform—appeared before them.  
She was no bigger than Millgangga's thigh, a tiny one. Without any signs
of fear, she curiously put her right finger to her mouth and looked up
with purple eyes.  
Then, she clapped her hands together and uttered something
unintelligible, something like, "Oh, space lizard," or so.

How did she appear here?  
They were fully prepared for warp-based close combat.  
The internal defenses were strong, and it would require a similarly
sized ship or facility to pierce the spatial barrier utilizing energy
from the collapse reactor. However, no such facilities were detected in
this star system, and judging from the current technological level, it
would take several thousand cycles for them to even grasp a fraction of
that technology. Naturally, it would be impossible to conceal it.

—The academic issues can wait.

Immediately recovering from the confusion, Millgangga pointed his left
hand at the silver female in black and white clothing.  
A miniature particle accelerator gun instantly deployed, and he extended
his right hand to stop her.  
Simultaneously, he accessed the ship's network through his neural
implant device and activated the defense systems.

"Stop!"

The safety device of the portable particle accelerator was deactivated,
and the battery cartridge connected.  
Firing the trigger would unleash energy capable of easily obliterating a
single lifeform.  
He caught sight of defense drones deploying at the edge of his vision,
and finally breathed a sigh of relief, satisfied with the measures.

The silver female turned her strangely purple eyes to the left and
right.  
Did she understand the situation even though she didn't understand the
words?

"That's right, is that it—?"

He stopped himself because he had forgotten to activate the translator.
The alarm was ringing.

'Aether alarm. Cracking is in progress—cancelled. Welcome,
administrator.'

One of the defense drones floated defenselessly towards the female, who
grabbed it.  
She patted the armed defense drone, examining it curiously, while
Millgangga looked around.  
A technician touched the three-dimensional console, and he saw that
access was being blocked—he realized a moment later that ship control
had been taken over.

"You…!"

It was now an instinctive reaction of fear.  
He pulled the trigger aimed at the female, releasing the particle
accelerator cannon.  
Excessive energy was instantly irradiated directly to the lifeform,

"Wh-…!?"

However, the beam did not incinerate the female.  
It vanished, as if swallowed by the void, before her eyes.  
The female looked at it without any signs of surprise, calmly
approached, and waved her hand.

—In an instant, all the Minarsi on the bridge collapsed as if crushed.  
It felt like every single cell in their bodies was being pressed against
the floor.

"Ga—…!?"

Millgangga was no exception; clinging to the floor, he barely managed to
turn his eyes to the female.  
She crouched down holding the drone, and looked down at Millgangga, her
mouth curving into a smile.

'First meeting. Greetings. Space primitive Minarsi. Krische is a servant
named Krische.'

An alarm blared, signaling strong aether interference.  
A strange sensation—only the meaning was transmitted directly into his
mind.

'Planet. What purpose?'

The innocently swaying psychokinetic particles.  
The overwhelming pressure was more terrifying than any enemy they had
ever encountered.  
It was an ancient, dreadful instinct for the Minarsi.

'Doubt.'

A multitude of crackling sounds echoed around them.  
Many of the Minarsi on the bridge had their tails severed, as instinct
commanded, and were bouncing on the bridge floor.  
Millgangga felt the pain in his tail's base—he severed his own tail,
suppressing the instinct to flee with willpower.

The silver female uttered a mysterious sound, "Hoe," while watching,
tilting her head.  
Then, as if remembering something, she activated the translator.  
The data collected and analyzed by Girylya beforehand informed them that
"Hoe" meant "admiration" or a similar expression.

'Greetings. Attack. No good.'

The meaning was transmitted directly to his mind again, and the pressure
on Millgangga's body disappeared.  
As he got up, those around him were similarly—looking at him in
confusion.

'…Who are you?'

"Oh, you can talk in our language."

'I'm using a translation device.  
…Answer my question; how did you intrude?'

"Um… if you ask how, I just bounced… hop, hop…"

'Hop, hop:  
An onomatopoeia emphasizing the act of bouncing by repeating "hop."'  
While looking at the translator's linguistic analysis, he simultaneously
analyzed the female in front of him.  
She looked no different from the intelligent lifeforms inhabiting Venua,
but a significant difference was observed: an unusually high density of
aether emanating from her.  
The ship's AI judged it to be a high-density aether entity—at least not
a simple organism.  
There seemed to be some subspecies among the Venua people, but such a
being had not been identified.

Girylya, who had been lying on the ground, finally stood up and shook
his head.  
It seemed to be an unidentified species.  
The "hop, hop" was likely a unique type of warp.  
At least, it was one of the unknown methods of travel.

"Anyway, let me try again… Nice to meet you, space lizard.  
Krische’s a servant named Krische. If you have no hostility, Krische
won't do anything bad, so don't worry."

The female—Krische—tilted her head, asking what their business on this
planet was.  
He looked at Girylya, who nodded silently.  
It was better to answer honestly—that seemed to be a common view.  
It was possible for someone who manipulated aether to that extent to
read minds.

She had suppressed this fleet flagship, equipped with the latest
technology, as easily as twisting a baby's tail.  
And terrifyingly, she was a servant.  
Literally—if the previous telepathy and Girylya's translation analysis
were correct, it meant that she had a master.  
What kind of being could surpass this transcendental aether lifeform?

'I am Millgangga, the Supreme Commander of the Minarsi Expeditionary
Fleet, serving the Supergalactic King Minalshare. I apologize for the
previous rudeness.  
…We came here for the exchange and coexistence with the intelligent
lifeforms on this planet, leading to prosperity, and for technological
enlightenment. We are also considering colonization after deepening our
exchanges.'

"Enlightenment, colonization…"

'We intend to provide technology to intelligent lifeforms that are yet
unable to even migrate into space, to provide them with the strength to
confront the many unknown threats that lurk.'

Fortunately, they did not show any hostility—or rather, they did not
even harbor hostility.  
The opponent had instantly seized control of this state-of-the-art large
warship, casually withstanding the particle accelerator cannon, which
could erase the shield deployed by the soldiers along with it.  
While paying close attention to Krische, the terrifying unknown entity,
he continued.

'To be honest, we considered the possibility of using some force during
the process of establishing a cooperative relationship. This fleet is
for intimidation… however, I swear on this horn, we have no intention of
conquering or destroying this planet.'

"Hmm, I see… that's what you mean. It was quite a large energy, so
Krische might have been a little hasty. Um…"

As she put her finger to her lips, the aether alarm sounded again.  
What instantly appeared was an old-fashioned, huge double door.  
The Minarsi widened their eyes and exchanged glances—when the door
opened, another individual with long red fur (on her head) peeked out.  
Beyond, a forest of lush trees could be seen.

"Ehehe, Berry, it's the space lizards."

"Krische-sama, that's no good. The space people probably have business
with those people, and the Ojou-sama is furious saying to come back
soon… um, hello…?"

The red-haired female also bowed her head, gazing at the countless tails
bouncing energetically and expressing her confusion.  
Then, she beckoned to Krische.

"Yes. Somehow, the business seemed peaceful."

"That's a relief.  
Let's go back, then."

"Excuse us, then," said Berry or so, and she took Krische and closed the
door.  
The door vanished without a trace, and just like a storm—Millgangga
stared blankly at Girylya.

"Girylya, that individual was…"

"I don't know. She looked like a Venua person on the surface… but a
being composed of aether… perhaps. It was a sight that was hardly
believable…"

The ship's AI had returned to its original state, but the Minarsi's
tails bouncing around them were a stark reality.

"…No, I really can't believe it.  
She broke through the ship's protective field and easily took over the
state-of-the-art ship's AI…"

"…Yes."

"The former can still be understood as an unknown method of aether-based
travel, but the latter is not something that can be solved with
aether.  
The AI itself was not destroyed; it was instantly understood and
rewritten in its complex structure… even if that entity was the
arithmetic unit itself, it exceeded the physically possible calculation
speed."

Girylya displayed Venua people's data on the window.  
The average intelligence level is slightly lower than that of the
Minarsi.  
Due to the small amount of data, the difference between the high and low
seems large, but even the highest is a realistic level as a biological
being. It would not reach the level to make the previous anomaly
possible.  
At the very least, that was an exceptional being even among the Venua
people.

"Among those we have encountered so far, she was an unimaginable
existence… but the word 'hasty.'  
She probably came to investigate our intentions.  
We possess enough warships to destroy this planet.  
She was probably wary of that."

"The other one also used the expression 'those people,' suggesting… that
beings like that, a different species from the Venua people, are lurking
on this planet."

"That's a reasonable assumption.  
…On this planet, there exists a god-like, transcendental being that has
been forgotten by us."

God—yes, that's the only way to make sense of it.  
At the very least, it was a higher-dimensional entity different from
themselves.

"Shall we… retreat?"

Girylya said in a voice that seemed to suppress something painful.  
An overwhelming abnormal existence against which our technology was
completely useless—the danger was too high, and abandoning interference
with this planet was one of the options.

"No, we will continue."

"But…"

"If they had been hostile, we could have been killed at that point.  
They just came to observe us… that was the atmosphere.  
Retreating here would only increase our concerns…  
It's better for us to take the initiative and deepen our exchanges with
them to prevent radicals from visiting here after hearing the story."

Millgangga declared resolutely, looking at Girylya.

"But we must exercise extreme caution. We will conduct a thorough
observation, and the descent and negotiations will be carried out
afterward. Girylya, I leave the command to you."

"Yes!"

The embassy established for the Minarsi was quite spacious, tailored to
their size.  
The ceiling height and corridors were like those of a museum, and the
conference room was like a party hall.  
The reason for such a size becomes clear at a glance of a Minarsi.

'Well, the more I learn, the more fascinating this place is.  
The various facilities and tools using aether… literally, you are a
gathering of magicians.'

"Haha, we were once called that.  
The use of aether has advanced considerably, but it wasn't as widespread
in prehistoric times, and the name you mentioned was frequently used,
closer to what you said."

Their height was twice that of an adult male—the Minarsi were very
large.  
When I first saw them, I was overwhelmed by their presence, but after
fifty years of contact, I'm no longer afraid.  
Commander Millgangga has a dignified attitude that is befitting a
soldier, but he has a gentle disposition.

Fifty years ago, they appeared across the planet with their advanced,
interstellar warships.  
They gathered the leaders of each nation in one place and, using their
absolute power, forced them to sign a ceasefire agreement.  
Then, they dedicated thirty years to establishing a unified federal
government, followed by cultural exchange and technological
enlightenment.

Before their arrival, there had been much debate about the existence of
extraterrestrials.  
But everyone agreed that these beings were as close to ideal aliens as
could be imagined.  
Despite cultural differences, they were remarkably sincere, and several
years ago, a designated residential zone for them was established on
this planet.

"The cycle of peace and war, of growth and decline… In prehistory, there
seems to have been a calendar called the Unified Era.  
The question you asked earlier was related to that,"

'Oh…'

"From my perspective, it's…like a myth.  
To be honest, I'm hesitant to tell Lord Millgangga this…"

'Don't worry. I'm very interested in this matter.'

Indeed, it would be a myth.  
A legend from thousands of years ago.  
However, even among scholars today, one of the popular tall tales is the
story of the ancient Queen Kreschenta.  
The theory that she, a powerful etheric ability user, created the
remaining World Tree and the etheric rainbow that once enveloped the
planet, remains quite popular.  
I hear that even influential scientists who supported the natural
occurrence theory have switched sides.  
Though I don't know the details, it seems people tend to give up when
faced with something they can't understand.

The problem is that beings with advanced civilizations like the
Minarsians are showing interest in this story.

—They want to speak to someone knowledgeable about powerful etheric
users, including those from the distant past.

That's what they seriously asked me the other day.  
Therefore, I have no choice but to call in etheric scholars who are
knowledgeable about history, a group that's more of a hobbyist
gathering.

Wearing an old-fashioned apron dress, with silver and red hair.  
Their names are Krische and Berry.  
I checked several places after being told it was extremely important,
and the two rural scholars living near the World Tree reacted strongly.
They're less etheric scholars and more enthusiastic archaeologists. I
had my doubts about whether this was truly the right approach, but at
least I did what I could, so I can't be blamed.

Entering a room with a large round table, I see two women, one with
black hair and the other with blonde hair. The two, sitting with their
backs to us, stood up and bowed deeply.

"Nice to meet you, Lord Millgangga. I am Aralize-Quilos, and this is my
assistant, Milsee-Gecia."

The blonde woman, Aralize, announced this like a demure lady.  
I could tell that the black-haired Milsee was nervous as she followed
with a greeting.  
Their counterpart is a Minarsian royal—at least the de facto ruler of
this planet currently. It's understandable that they're nervous.  
The blonde woman looked at Millgangga with some curiosity, while the
black-haired woman seemed somewhat intimidated by his large stature.

'Black-haired one, don't be afraid.  
I'm not going to eat you; I just want to hear your story.  
I apologize for taking up your time today. Please, let's begin.'

"Y-yes…"

Millgangga sat at the far end of the round table, and we sat next to
them. The blonde woman projected the documents she held in her right
hand using a projector.

"First, I'd like to confirm the information you're seeking. Are you
simply interested in historical etheric ability users, or are you
interested in the individuals known as Krische and Berry?"

'The latter.  
It seems you know something about them.'

"Yes.  
At least, Krische is said to be a great etheric ability user who left
her name in prehistorical legends.  
The name Berry is also mentioned, though sparsely, as her attendant…"

Then she expressed some doubts.

"Krische's name is quite famous… There are many accounts, and she even
appears in some games as the name of a general in the continent-unifying
nation of Orbelun.  
However, the name Orbrinar is more famous…"

'Orbrinar?'

"Heavenly Sword…or Divine Sword, meaning God's Soldier…"

"Alberan and Alberinea."

"Excuse me, the pronunciation varies depending on the old
language…Milsee's pronunciation seems closest to the correct one, but
that's essentially what it means. Even now, with many records lost,
there are many plays and research materials from that time, leaving no
doubt that she was an unparalleled general and a powerful etheric
ability user."

But, she continued.

"However, those who know Berry are quite rare.  
Many documents only mention her as a red-haired attendant, and only
those very knowledgeable about the period know her name as Berry."

'…I see.  
That's what bothered me—why I know that name.'

"So Milsee speculated that perhaps Lord Millgangga had met the two…that
was her deduction."

"Both of them, isn't that impolite?  
Such a fantasy—"

'Good, Galan.  
I see… you two are indeed the people I expected.'

Millgangga chuckled, a characteristic Minarsian laugh.

"W-we met them!? Alberinea!?"

The nervous Milsee jumped up, placing her hands on the table.  
She immediately pressed her head and sat back down.

"M-Mil…stay."

"Y-yes…"

Millgangga nodded calmly.

'As you deduced…at least, I have met them.  
It's unbelievable even now, but…shortly after arriving here, my flagship
was seized.  
By that etheric entity named Krische.'

"No way…"

Galan stared at him, dumbfounded. Millgangga chuckled again and
displayed a window in the air.

'Because of the nature of the footage, I've never shown it to the Venua
before…but it's alright for you two. This is visual and etheric
observation data.'

The footage is from the massive ship's bridge. The Minarsians are in an
uproar at the sudden appearance of a silver-haired etheric entity.  
Its outline is blurry, emitting a strong light.  
The footage, a restoration and correction of distorted image data due to
unknown noise using various sensor records and the data from
Millgangga's and his crew's brains, doesn't clearly show the etheric
entity's form.  
It easily deflects a powerful particle accelerator cannon, and the next
moment, the Minarsians are prostrate—their countless tails thrashing
wildly are clearly visible.

'We were completely helpless against the powerful etheric
interference.  
Incredibly, the ship's AI was instantly cracked and hijacked.  
Even now, it feels like a nightmare…but since this record exists, we
can't just dismiss it as a dream.'

"That's Alberinea…"

Milsee gasped, her eyes sparkling as she stared at the window.  
Aralize also looked surprised. Galan, too, was undoubtedly shocked by
the footage.  
Having witnessed many of the Minarsian's astonishing technological feats
since his days as a Minarsian liaison officer, Galan's astonishment was
immense.  
Their technology, which they refer to as magic, is beyond magic to us.  
The fact that a single individual could seize their flagship is beyond
astounding.

"…Orbu—excuse me, Alberinea's language is close to our unified language.
But it sounds quite archaic…perhaps it's a dialect derived from the Mail
language, considered the prototype of the unified language…no, the
Western Common Language.  
The language used in Alberan, the continent-unifying nation at that
time, was called that."

'So it seems.  
We have been analyzing it since then, but there are some differences
between this language and the known languages.'

A red-haired woman suddenly appeared through a large door and a
silver-haired girl ran towards them.  
Once they both entered, the door disappeared as if nothing had happened.
Only the countless thrashing tails remained, a very chaotic image.  
It's no wonder they hadn't shown this before.  
For the Minarsians, tails breaking off during intense fear is a shameful
trait, so showing it would have been unacceptable.

'What do you think of the etheric use shown here…as scholars?'

"It's beyond imagination. I myself have studied and learned to handle
etheric use more than the average person…but this is on a different
level entirely.  
Honestly, I don't understand it.  
At least, no ordinary human could do the same."

"I told you!  
It's definitely the queen and Alberinea who—"

"Mil, I know you're excited, but calm down. Stay."

Milsee, apparently getting excited, blushed and apologized.

"Sorry, she specializes in prehistorical civilizations and Alberan…and
she believes that the World Tree and etheric rainbow are largely related
to the powerful etheric ability users of that time."

'It's fine. That's what scholars are like.'

Millgangga chuckled.

'That's what I want to know too. I want to know what kind of being this
Krische is. The AI's analysis of the high-density etheric entity, that
extraordinary ability…I believe she is like a god.'

"Y-yes…I think she was such a being.  
It is believed that about 8,000 years have passed since the
establishment of the Unified Era—the Alberan era—but there were many
legends about seeing a mysterious figure wearing an apron dress."

Milsee answered, blushing slightly.

"There are similar urban legends even today, but it's difficult to
verify their truth.  
In fact, there is no record of it in any video medium."

'Venua technology wouldn't allow it.  
Even the footage we just saw was distorted by noise. Without our
technology and the data from the ship's sensors, we couldn't have
restored it.'

At this, Milsee exchanged surprised glances with Aralize.  
Millgangga asked what was wrong, and Aralize replied.

"There are a few such stories actually.  
There are stories about strange visitors, but the surveillance camera
footage showed uncertain noise, and their image wasn't recorded…it's
usually dismissed as just another tall tale."

"So, they were intentionally interfering with the image data, causing
noise?"

"It's a possibility."

Millgangga nodded.

'Galan, thank you for bringing them here.  
The scholars I wanted to meet are precisely like them.'

"Yes.  
I was a little worried about whether we could meet your expectations."

Millgangga narrowed his eyes.  
It was meant to be a smile—having been here for decades, he had become
quite accustomed to their culture.

'I'd like to talk to you both, along with our researchers, in the
future. But first, I have some personal questions I'd like to ask—'

"Yes, with pleasure."

The two also smiled as they replied.

It was certainly a mythical story. A super-high-density etheric rainbow
that swallows stars. An etheric vortex that even the Minarsians, who
have almost no ability to perceive it, could observe.

To hear that a single life form created it—even Millgangga, a Minarsian
who built a civilization across the galaxy, was awestruck. An entity
capable of massive etheric use that transcends etheric limits—in
planetary civilization, it could be called a god. Or perhaps its power
wouldn't even be limited to a single planet.

The entity believed to be Alberinea appeared immediately after the warp
out.

'Hmm, I see…so that's it. It was quite a large amount of energy,
Krische, I might have jumped to conclusions a little bit. Um…’

Judging from her actions, she accurately grasped our combat strength and
undoubtedly came here to protect the planet. It seemed unlikely that an
entity capable of silently attacking and subduing a fleet capable of
warp travel would possess power limited to a single planet.

She probably perceives and controls a vast expanse of space.  
There's also no guarantee that his home planet, Minardoria, isn't within
her range of influence.

That's why we pursued an exchange with the Venua.  
Having been noticed by such an entity, we must take a friendly approach
and hasten the conclusion of a non-aggression pact. We must eliminate
the possibility that other Minarsians, unaware of the situation or
overly optimistic, might try to conquer the Venua under the guise of
eliminating a threat.  
And I was also certain that they would be a great help in eliminating
dangerous creatures like the Arnia. For the peace of the universe, I was
determined to obtain their assistance.

The problem is that we haven't been able to have direct dialogue with
them. We’ve been arranging meetings with the scholars frequently, but
the Queen Group (as they're informally called) doesn't seem to be
interfering with surface society.  
The two scholars said that they were watching humanity from the shadows.

Despite several near-extinction events caused by wars, tectonic shifts,
and meteorite impacts, this planet has survived and repeatedly rebuilt
itself. The two scholars believe that the Queen Group's power was behind
this, but at least there's no record of them appearing publicly or
interfering politically. Most of the legends about the Queen Group
describe encounters with gods in extreme environments.

I've understood only too well that they're not someone you can just
meet, and it's one of my biggest worries.  
At least, no major problems have occurred.  
While some people are scared of or dislike the Minarsians who came from
space, it was within expectations, and any related incidents have been
minor.  
Seeing as they haven't contacted us with warnings or anything, we
suspect the Queen Group isn't particularly concerned, but our
uncertainty remains.

'Perhaps they're leisurely sightseeing.  
They seem to have spent thousands of years without interacting with us.'

'Aralize would think that, wouldn't she?  
There's probably some deeper consideration—'

This thought came to me after hearing such a story.

"…?"

"What's wrong?"

"Oh, no…I thought I saw a momentary error."

"Show me."

Many tourists visit under the guise of a public viewing of the interior
of the spaceship, creating quite a lively atmosphere. As they're a
relatively friendly species, there were some opinions that displaying
the interior of a spacefaring vessel, even an old one, packed with
advanced technology, was risky. However, they're not yet at a
technological level where they can understand or analyze it.

We intended to continue this for a year or so, changing locations
depending on the results, but there was a response two months after the
launch. We increased the number of surveillance personnel, put in place
a comprehensive security system, and Millgangga himself stayed on the
ship as much as possible during the event.  
On that day, I looked at the footage at the words of a soldier on
surveillance duty,

"There doesn't seem to be any abnormalities—?"

Then he slapped his tail on the floor.  
He recovered from the tingling pain and looked at the image.

The footage shows an area where people experience an old-model space
fighter used for space combat.  
A group of people, including Venua in white and black clothing—the
old-fashioned apron dress—were enjoying themselves in it.  
Very cheerful Venua people.  
It was an unremarkable sight, but there was something off.

'—The objective is to find the Queen Group and negotiate directly. Their
names are Krische and Berry, or possibly Kreschenta, Selene, Elvena,
Anne, Lila, or similar names. The group is characterized by their apron
dresses; some may wear swords.  
Their language is a dialect of the unified language. They are thought to
possess the ability to interfere with perception—'

Millgangga's eyes widen as the recording he'd prepared is played.

"Pick up the conversation and analyze the language.  
Have the other observers focus their surveillance on the test ride area
and its surroundings, monitoring the movements of the group in apron
dresses. Repeat, apron dresses, apron dresses.  
And summon Girylya to the reception room immediately."

"Y-yes!"

He rushes off immediately to the test ride area, ignoring the surprised
onlookers.  
Upon arrival, he quickly scans his surroundings and replays the
recording.

"——The objective is to find the Queen group and negotiate directly.
Their names are Krische and Berry, or possibly Kreschenta and Selene.  
Elvena, Anne, Lila, and similar names are possibilities. The group's
characteristic is apron dresses; some may carry swords. Their language
is a unified language with a dialect. They are believed to possess the
ability to interfere with perception——"

Apron dresses, apron dresses.  
Millgangga, who had almost forgotten what he was looking for, approaches
the group of seven enjoying test rides without regard for the onlookers.

"Excuse the interruption, I am Millgangga, Supreme Commander of the
Minarsi Expeditionary Fleet."

He speaks in translated Unified Language, and the moment they turn to
look, he feels the air change. An indescribable, instinctive unease. The
previously vague group in apron dresses solidifies into a tangible
presence before his eyes for the first time.

"Ah, you're that space lizard from before,"

says Berry, an individual with red fur. Krische, who had been riding a
small ship on her lap, replies:

"Ah, from before..."

Berry nods in agreement. Then an individual with golden fur looks at her
with an indescribable expression, saying:

"Miss, that's the Minarsi commander who was on the spaceship Krische
boarded a little while ago."

"...Are you alright?"

"I wonder...?"

The individual displays a typical Venua expression of utter
bewilderment.

"There's no need for alarm.  
If you would be so kind, we would like to speak with you, and have a
room prepared."

He had anticipated some commotion, but despite this, the surrounding
Venua people, and even the Minarsi personnel on duty for guidance and
security, remain calm.  
The same is true of Millgangga as he guides them.

"You silly thing, this is all because you just barged in without
thinking."

"Uuu..."

The terrifying Krische, however, is having her cheek pinched and being
scolded by the golden-haired individual during their journey, making
their power dynamics unclear. Observing them, it seemed that this
individual—Selene—was the leader of the group. However, upon being
invited to the spacious reception room, which was set up for Venua
people, it is the individual with red-tinged golden fur who naturally
sits in the center.  
She looks at Berry with displeasure, grimaces at the offered chair, and
then has Berry sit and she perches on top of her. Krische watches this
with dissatisfaction, sighs, and sits on top of Selene, while the others
stand and watch with wry smiles. Four of them are wearing apron
dresses—it's safe to say that they are a group wearing apron dresses.
While there are also female individuals in what looks like underwear, as
the records indicated, they are all female and the apron dresses are a
distinguishing feature, so the information seems correct.

"Welcome, Millgangga-sama.  
I am... yes, Queen Kreschenta, ruler of this world."

"...My greetings, Your Majesty Kreschenta."

The central figure is wearing a fine white dress with elegant silver
ornaments. The others don't contradict her statements, and seem to leave
things to her—she is likely the leader.  
She is likely the same Queen who ruled the great nation of Alberan in
ancient times.

Even Alberinea, who is treated as a servant, possesses the power to
easily subdue the Minarsi fleet. Millgangga addresses her with the
respect due a monarch, equal in status to his own sovereign.

"As I said, we have no hostile intentions.  
We were simply searching for you to seek an opportunity for dialogue."

"Then rest assured. We have neither hostility nor interest in you,
unless you intend to do something to this planet."

"I am relieved to hear that. Our purpose is to interact with the
inhabitants of this planet and provide technological enlightenment.  
The universe holds many threats; it is the mission of the Hypergalactic
Minarsi Empire to protect pre-interstellar civilizations and teach them
how to counter such threats."

Kreschenta doesn't react particularly, and Millgangga continues.

"Of course, colonization is part of our objectives, but we will do so
with consideration for the local civilization, prioritizing
co-prosperity over domination.  
This has been our policy for fifty-seven years in this time unit, and it
will remain our policy in the future, Your Majesty."

"Then do as you please.  
As I said, I have little interest.  
You may negotiate with the current government as you see fit.  
We have no intention of getting involved and should be treated as
non-existent."

She reveals that she has long since retired.

"It's all rather troublesome, and I dislike the disturbance around me.  
Let this be the last time you try to contact us. If that's respected,
then we'll have no further dealings, a mutual non-interference
agreement, how does that sound?"

"Thank you for your kind words... those words have reassured me.  
However, there is a problem... this planet is facing a crisis."

"A crisis?"

"Yes.  
It may be decades, centuries, or even millennia from now.  
But a monster that can easily devour a planet, a star system, was
confirmed nearby during a visit fifty years ago."

He pictures it, and continues.

"I understand you don't want to be bothered by us.  
However, that power to instantly seize control of a fleet... you possess
the ethereal abilities of a god.  
That's why we're telling you this, and if possible, we would like your
cooperation in eradicating this malignant lifeform."

Millgangga says, turning his gaze to Girylya sitting beside him. A
projection display appears in mid-air.  
It shows a colony of cosmic amoebas, the planet Kudaras, destroyed by
the Arnia.  
Images of the planet before the Arnia attack, when it was thriving, and
then after the Arnia engulfed it.  
And finally, after all buildings were incinerated, the desolate
wasteland.

Girylya speaks.

"It's a sentient amoeba called Arnia that, if even a piece remains, will
absorb organic matter and multiply infinitely. Once it enters a planet,
it will bring about an irreversible disaster."

"Amoeba..."

"Yes, a primitive creature that can freely change shape. Normally, it
lacks intelligence, but this Arnia possesses a certain level of
intelligence and the ability to travel through space alone... and it's
becoming more strategic and tactical year by year.  
It's an opponent that even our fleet struggles with... if even a single
piece gets onto this planet, the tragedy of this planet Kudaras could be
repeated."

Remembering the tragedy of Kudaras, Girylya and Millgangga quietly sway
their tails, lowering their tips. Then they touch their right horns,
expressing their condolences.

"Its ecology is still unknown. However, it possesses an unbelievable
growth rate, and in our battles with it, it has been observed to evolve
and learn. If we don't exterminate it early, this galaxy could be
overwhelmed by Arnia. Therefore, even if only for now, we want your
help... that's what we're thinking... this is actually—"

"Oh, please, behave. We're in the middle of a conversation..."

"...?"

Simultaneously with the Arnia appearing on the display, something
wriggles out of Krische's apron dress—her waist pouch—onto the table.  
A flesh-colored amoeba, wriggling and changing shape.  
It bears a striking resemblance to the one on the display.

The eyes of everyone in the room shift back and forth between the amoeba
on the display and the one wriggling on the table, in silent
stillness.  
Then, except for Krische, a look of concern, almost pity, slowly turns
towards Millgangga and the others. In the silent room, only Krische
tilts her head curiously.

"Oh, I'm sorry. Please continue.  
Here you go, wiggly-wiggly, over here."

As if it were a pet.  
Watching Krische coax the amoeba—the Arnia—back into the pouch, Girylya
freezes,

"......"

Millgangga also looks up at the ceiling as if rejecting understanding,
remembering his long-forgotten homeland.

——Afterwards, the long war between the Hypergalactic Minarsi Empire and
the Arnia ended with the signing of the Hypergalactic Wiggly-Wiggly
Agreement. The refusal of mutual understanding and communication, the
inhumane soft-body experiments against the ambassadors of goodwill, and
the cowardly preemptive attacks resulting in massacres. The then
Hypergalactic King Minarshea fully accepted their claim that their
species' survival was threatened by the Hypergalactic Minarsi Empire,
and declared this incident a great tragedy caused by misunderstandings
and discrepancies in the two species' forms and methods of
communication.

The establishment of communication through special ether signals and the
development of translators.  
The two species subsequently faced many problems, but over a long period
of time, they forgot the days of war and set out on a path of
co-prosperity.

It is said that there was a hidden hero behind this historical
reconciliation, but their name has not been revealed, and it is rumored
that a gag order was issued by Hypergalactic King Minarshea.
