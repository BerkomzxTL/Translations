# Chapter 320 - Responsibility 6

Entering the kitchen, I found a red-haired servant.  
Her hair, which used to be shoulder-length, had grown to her back at
some point.  
A single everburning lamp and moonlight illuminated the kitchen.  
Wearing a white negligee, her back was beautiful, as if melting into the
faintly glowing kitchen.

“Would you like some, Anne-sama?”

“Eh?”

Her words preceded her turning around.  
Slightly surprised by her berry-like smile as she looked at me, I
nodded.  
Berry continued pouring fresh milk into the pot.

“Um, I guess you could tell by the sound of my footsteps…?”

“Yes.”

“….Amazing.”

When I said that honestly, she chuckled and said it was a joke.

“Unlike Krische-sama, I can't reliably tell just from the way the door
opens or footsteps.  
There was still light leaking from your room, and it seemed you’d been
making hot milk last night, so I just figured it was you, Anne-sama.”

“I… I see…”

With a mischievous smile, she called it a little magic trick and put the
milk in the refrigerator.  
Regardless, being able to be certain like that is amazing, she said
before I could comment.

“….Are you worried?”

“Ah… yes, I am.”

Berry doesn’t often tell jokes.  
When she does, it's usually to Krische, Selene, or Kreschenta – she had
never said such things to me before.  
However, I sensed concern in that joke, and I found it quite pleasing.

Before our proper exchange, a letter arrived in the royal capital a few
days ago saying that Father intends to visit Kreisharana and learn about
their culture there for a while.  
Kreschenta gave her permission, and he should be in Kreisharana around
now.

Yesterday, we talked about this during dinner.  
Asked by Selene, Krische spoke of her time entering that mountain for
Berry, but Kreisharana is a harsh land.  
Gururun-like magical beasts – ferocious magical beasts – are everywhere,
she said.

She said she discarded a large amount of the hunted beast's meat,
regretting being so wasteful, speaking casually as if the beasts were
mere hunting prey. However, I could easily understand just how dangerous
that world is.  
When I first saw a Gururun, I turned pale with fright.  
I got used to it by seeing Krische and Berry repeatedly assuring me it
was alright and relying on them.  
Now, I even thought it was cute, but that's only because this particular
Gururun is unusually docile.

I knew that a single magical beast is essentially a monster that can
easily annihilate a hundred-man army, and seeing the Gururun’s physique
and physical abilities left no room for doubt.

My father is in those mountains, among hordes of such beasts.  
Imagining that kept me from sleeping well at night.

“Eh?”

Before me floated a white cat, and on its head, a small honey-colored
cat.  
The two cats raised their arms, opened their mouths wide, and pretended
to attack me. Their appearance was somehow cute – and then a mug was
placed in my hands, and the cats, walking in mid-air, jumped into it.  
The larger cat transformed into milk steaming from the mug, and the
small honey-colored cat swam and dissolved in the milk.

I stared blankly at the mug and looked up.  
Berry, with bluish phosphorescence on her fingertips, chuckled and
asked, “How is it?”

“It’s more of a playful trick, really.”

“….It’s like something out of a fairy tale.”

“Fufu, thank you.”

Smiling, I wrapped my hands around the mug.  
It's a secret between us.  
Everyone was told how it's done.  
She inscribes a spell in mid-air, performing magic without relying on
magic crystals.  
It must be something incredible – but I wasn't that surprised.  
This mansion was like a fairy tale world, full of wonders.

But regardless of that, I thought the woman in front of me was a
magician or something.  
In this instant, she erased the dark anxiety within me, making me feel
safe like a child.  
Kissing the honey-flavored milk, she gently stroked my head and said,

“Your smiling face is truly lovely, Anne-sama.”

“….I’m sorry.  
I’m an unfit servant.”

I must have been wearing a gloomy expression.  
She replied, “No,”

“I’m quite a worrywart myself, so I understand your feelings to some
extent.”

“….Yes.”

“I can’t irresponsibly say your father will be alright… but worries
become lighter when shared.  
Please don't overwork yourself alone; don’t hesitate to call on me
anytime.”

She chuckled softly, her smile gentle as she cupped my cheeks in her
hands.

“How about this?  
I was thinking of going to bother Selene-sama, who seems to be burning
the midnight oil diligently again today…  
Would you like to join me, Anne-sama?”

“….Yes.  
Fufu, I’ll accompany you.”

As we left the room, light still spilled from Selene’s room.  
More diligent and hardworking than anyone, Selene always pushes herself
beyond her limits.  
She probably worries about her, about me, about Elvena, about Krische
and Kreschenta, and so she lives her days.

‘—Appearance matters.  
Just as you can't walk if you can't see what's in front of you, what you
aim for is important. I'm glad you've found a goal, at least for now.  
But—’

‘Yes, Father! I will strive to be a servant like in that story!’

‘…U-um…’

She is the fairytale servant I admire. I understand I can’t become like
her, but still, striving for that – that’s surely a good thing.  
My father also said so, and he’s on that errand in Kreisharana.

“My father is someone I deeply respect… a wonderful father and a
wonderful noble.”

“….Yes.  
I agree that he is a very remarkable person.”

“Therefore, no matter how dangerous the mission is… I believe he will
fulfill his duties as a nobleman and return safely.”

She nods happily.

“Worrying is inevitable when thinking alone… Even though I think she’ll
be alright, even with someone as strong as Krische-sama, I worry when
she goes to the battlefield.”

“Ha…  
I should have shown more consideration, like Argan-sama just now… I’m
utterly ashamed.”

“Nonsense. I’ve been helped so much by Anne-sama, you just haven’t
realized it.”

Pouring milk into a mug, Berry said, “Shall we go?”  
I received Selene’s milk first, answering, “Yes,” and followed her out
of the kitchen.

“Selene-sama is probably frowning and groaning right now.  
Let's have a chat while watching her many expressions and have some milk
slowly.”

“….We might get scolded.”

“Fufu, it’s alright. What matters is not what you do, but what you feel
as you do it.”

She raised a finger and twirled.  
The hem of her negligee fluttered, reflecting the soft light of the
moonlight streaming through the window.

“It’s part of the job to tidy up, take care of things, and help the
master’s work progress smoothly.  
Sometimes, angering a master who’s burning the midnight oil, making them
lose motivation and want to throw their work away… even receiving
complaints is part of the job.”

And with a mischievous laugh, she said,

“That, too, is an important duty of a servant.”

---

Before the approaching Suiko, I threw a wine bottle.  
Then, with the tip of the jeweled sword in my hand, I smashed it against
its belly.  
Along with the shards, I scattered a strongly scented perfume.

I fell to the ground, narrowly dodging its powerful arm, and immediately
got back up.  
The Suiko, having had a large amount of perfume splashed on its face,
let out a terrifying roar as it thrashed around, wiping its face with
its arm.

The people of Kreisharana dislike dressing up.  
The perfume was one of the many gifts I brought, but it was not received
well.  
However, now I deeply appreciate my wife for suggesting it.

A single vial costs dozens of silver coins – it is normally used in
extremely small amounts, barely a hint of fragrance.  
If the undiluted liquid is applied directly to the face, even humans
would choke.  
For a Suiko, known for its superior sense of smell, the suffering must
be incomparable to that of humans.

I got to my feet, confident it had worked.  
But still, my hand holding the sword trembled, and my legs felt weak.

A single roar shook the heavens and numbed my body from the core.  
Once the raging beast stepped into the brightly lit square, its ferocity
became even more apparent.  
The swiping blow of its arm swept away a sturdy stone well frame in one
breath, and seeing that made me acutely aware of my own insignificance.

“…”

My instincts screamed to run. My legs felt as if they were petrified,
and my breath was caught in my throat. There's a part of me that
applauds the fact that I did enough, and the images of my wife and
children flash before my eyes. If I die here, I’ll never see them again.
My whole being cried out that I didn't want to die, trembling with
terror.

“Lord Marquis!”

“Lord Marquis!  
Flee!”

Startled by the voices from above and behind me, I gripped my sword so
tightly it was painful.  
I pushed through the pain to suppress my fear and pressed forward.  
For a moment, I regretted that step forward.

—Had I ever experienced such a long moment in my life?  
I still saw the image of my brother's sword burned into my mind.  
I recalled the respectful gaze toward Argosh.  
My body moved forward, but my mind seemed to travel back to the past.  
I recalled my father’s words, recalling my own arrogant self lecturing
my brother with those words.

Noble birth is not proof of nobility.  
Only by fulfilling those duties, purely and simply.  
The image of dedicating oneself wholly to that responsibility is what
makes a noble a noble.

Behind me are the weak who must be protected.  
Before me is a fearsome monster.  
Argosh still hasn't fulfilled his duty.

‘There are many sword techniques, each with its merits.  
But this Zain sword is the most fitting for a noble.  
Not to defend, but to charge in, pierce, and kill the opponent before
they strike.  
It is a sword a coward cannot wield. You must have the conviction born
of training, belief in your sword, and a willingness to stake your life
to wield this blade.’

Recalling my teacher's instruction from my childhood, when he was a
guest at our house, I pointed the blade forward.  
My whole being transformed into a blade aimed at piercing my opponent.  
Turning my whole body into a weapon, unafraid of death, I devoted
everything to unleashing the training I’d undergone.  
From the remaining five meters, I coiled my body like a spring, twisting
and tightening, and like a drawn bowstring, I released myself—reaching a
speed I couldn’t even perceive,

“—!!”

With all my honed skill, I plunged the blade into the Suiko's belly.  
I didn't even feel the sensation of piercing flesh, only reaching
halfway.  
While hearing its roar, I withdrew the blade, took a stance, and—

“Guh!?”

I was thrown back by a blow from its powerful arm, flying through the
air.  
I flew several meters, smashing into a barrel in front of the house,
rolling and coughing.  
My supposedly sturdy leather armor was dented, a dull pain in my
chest—my ribs were probably broken or cracked, or maybe my internal
organs were injured.  
Unable to move from the pain, I desperately tried to raise myself.

I had plunged the blade a foot deep.  
Yet the Suiko rose, letting out a heaven-shaking roar.  
And it was fixing its enraged eyes on Argosh.

—Regret.  
It was the best strike of my life, to the best of my ability.  
I had never wielded such a sword before.  
Still, the beast before me was on a higher level—unfazed by Argosh’s
desperate attack, it pressed closer.

Closing my eyes to the inescapable death,

“—Protect the Marquis!!”

At that cry, I opened my eyes.  
Drawing their swords, or spears, my subordinates were charging at the
Suiko.  
Dodging the thrown spears, the Suiko leaped back, the men scattering in
pairs.  
Arrows rained down from above, several piercing its body, and spears
were planted in the ground to create a barrier between Argosh and the
tiger.

“We shall not let you approach the Marquis, even if it costs our lives!”

“Cax…!”

“Marquis, I’ll buy you time!!  
Flee!!”

Just as Argosh tries to fulfill his noble duty, I realize they too are
trying to fulfill their duty as bodyguards.  
My eyes widened—and I smiled, gripping my sword again.  
Suppressing the pain, I got to my feet and stepped forward.

“I will not flee!  
Support me!!”

“….Yes!”

My body was so aching that I could hardly move, but I was a magic
wielder.  
I focused only on the flow of magic, manipulating the virtual muscles
created by magic, propelling myself forward with sheer will.  
Even if I die disgracefully, at this moment, I would fulfill my duty.  
As long as I could breathe, as long as my life remained, I would buy
time, even if I had to fight with my teeth, focusing solely on my duty.

I grasped the spear that had been thrust before me, throwing it with all
my might at the Suiko, others following suit.  
The six who descended were all magic possessors.  
Those spears would deliver a significant blow even to the Suiko.  
Not a single trained spear missed, but the Suiko dodged them.  
It hid behind a building to evade them, and the arrows shot by the men
climbing the watchtower revealed its position.

Still, the opponent was a magical beast—not a human being.  
Despite its injuries, it dodged the arrows and spears, moving at an
unbelievable speed, easily leaping over buildings and rushing towards
us.

“—!!”

Even though I thought it was impossible to dodge, I stepped forward, the
Zain sword.  
The moment I took my stance, realizing I was a moment too late, I lunged
forward to thrust the blade.  
Remembering my training, believing in myself, I would thrust the blade,
buying even a little time even if I died.

In an instant of imperceptible speed, the Suiko's body seemed to waver
in mid-air.  
The tip of the blade, surpassing that fleeting moment, drove itself into
its flesh.  
Realizing it had hit its shoulder rather than its throat, I clicked my
tongue, but before I could do anything else, I released my sword, kicked
the beast, and rolled away.

In my line of sight was the raging Suiko.  
It had a sword embedded in its shoulder, and a spear thrust into its
side.  
The moment I realized it wasn't from my guard but a Kreisharana spear, a
large, roaring man leaped at the Suiko.  
He pulled out the spear from the tiger’s belly, stabbing it
repeatedly.  
Then, plunging it in deeply once more, he drew a large curved sword and
brought it down from high above onto the convulsing Suiko’s neck,
embedding the blade in its flesh.

A figure even more ferocious and fearsome than a magical beast.  
Breathing heavily, he approached me.

“…Dukaran-sama…”

Dukaran, who looked towards me, furrowed his brow and said,

“Be quiet. Lie on your back.”

As I did as told, he used a small knife to cut the seams of my leather
armor and remove it.  
Then, he tore my clothes as well, lightly touching my chest to check my
wounds.  
As I endured the pain, letting out a cry, he eventually removed his
hand.

“It’s not too bad. You won’t die.  
But don’t move for a while.  
….Hey, take him to the women and have someone tend to his wounds.”

“Y-yes, sir. Marquis, your shoulder…”

“Dukaran, how is Giterns-dono…?”

“It seems he is fine, Lila-sama. There may be a crack in his bone, but
thanks to his leather armor, it's not too severe.  
If he doesn't move much more, he won't die.”

With a flapping of wings, Lila appeared, letting out a sigh of relief.  
She hopped off her griffin and ran to Argosh’s side.

“It seems they’ve finished off the other one too. The warriors are
returning.  
Giterns-dono needs to rest, please stay still.”

“Yes…”

Coughing violently, I nearly collapsed from the pain in my chest, Cax
supporting me, and Lila rubbing my back.  
Seeing blood on my spit, Lila cried out, "Giterns-dono," laughing wryly
and shaking her head.

“It’s just a cut in your mouth… that’s the blood. Don’t worry.”

“….Thank you so much, Giterns-dono.”

“….You’re welcome.”

Another person, besides Lila, also supported Argosh.  
Leaning on him, Argosh announced,

"I have fulfilled my duty… However, the situation is still far from
safe. I leave the rest to you, Dukaran-dono."

" …Needless to say.  
The injured are a hindrance. Go."

" …Dukaran"

Argosh chuckled wryly and left the square.

The excitement of battle had dulled the pain, it seemed. For about three
days afterward, even the slightest movement caused excruciating pain.  
Several other similarly injured warriors were gathered in the meeting
hall used by the women, where they received treatment.

Fortunately, I didn't lack for company. The women, who applied ointment
good for bruises, gave pain relievers, and tended to our wounds, thanked
me sincerely and told me about things outside.  
Those of my subordinates who had free time came to check on me and
talked about the fields. I also passed the time conversing with fellow
injured warriors.  
We talked about how we were injured, spending our time peacefully.

While I'm usually someone who can't stay still, thanks to these men who
seemed to share my sentiment, I managed not to rush things. Fortunately,
it seemed nobody died this time. The man who had been flung from the
tower was also there.  
Like Argosh, he had suffered chest bruises, a neck injury requiring
immobilization, a broken right arm, and a sprained left leg.

His bed was next to mine. Seeing him moaning about the pain made me feel
better about my own injuries. He was a young, funny man.  
He even asked Argosh, after learning he had a wife and child, for advice
on how to win a woman's heart, making the other men laugh.  
One of the women tending to the injuries was apparently his love
interest. Seeing him stiffen like a statue while she treated him made
even Argosh burst out laughing.

He must have been deeply in love, it made me remember my struggles with
my rather insensitive wife. I fell instantly in love with her when she
visited as a servant, but it took five years for her to realize my
feelings. In her mind, we naturally grew close and became aware of each
other's feelings over time. However, she still doesn't understand how
much effort I put into making her realize my feelings.

Thinking of my wife made me think of Anne as well. Anne inherited her
mother's temperament, which was both her strength and her weakness.
Unfortunately, she also inherited my bad traits, and I worried about her
future. I'm happy she's happy now by the Queen's side, but as her
father, I naturally worry about what lies ahead.  
While talking about family matters, my days passed peacefully.

I was allowed to go outside after about a week.  
It seemed that Vinthril and the others had returned around that time.  
Having heard about it, they expressed their deep gratitude to Argosh.

In case of an emergency, it’s apparently the custom for warriors not to
visit the injured. Lila had visited frequently, but none of the warriors
came; the warriors were true to their duty.  
However, when I went outside, many men, young and old, greeted me with
laughter and pats on the back.  
Those who had previously eyed me suspiciously had changed their minds as
well.

Even having nearly died and been injured was a small matter considering
that I was accepted by them. The pain itself felt like a badge of honor,
though I didn't say so. Apparently, there were other villages where
people died.  
For them, that was daily life.

In Alberan, even military personnel are praised for their bravery in
confronting Suiko.  
Even just thrusting a spear is considered a courageous act, and the
general personally awards those who do so.  
If you kill one, the Queen herself gives a reward, which would be enough
to grant you a Rinea title.  
But for them, that was simply the minimum standard.  
The courage to confront Suiko was something they were expected to have.
Remembering the courage I mustered while trembling with fear, I felt I
couldn't boast to them.

Argosh accepted this as a matter of course and returned to his daily
routine.  
He began by lightly swinging his sword in the morning, and then went to
the fields to look at the harvest.  
He harvested the large water sweet potatoes and told Lila that he wanted
everyone in the village to eat them, and she told him that there would
be a feast to celebrate surviving the crisis safely.  
So Argosh also attended the feast.

The men competed in spear and bow skills, and the women dressed lightly
and danced, only during this time.  
They drank, ate meat, and enjoyed the feast.  
Compared to the festivals held in Alberan city, it was quite
small-scale. It was no different from what was held in villages across
the land.

But seeing their joyful laughter, Argosh thought it was just as good as
any city festival.  
He watched the severely injured man spend time with his love interest,
stiffening up, and chuckled wryly when...

"Oi"

A voice called out from behind.  
Turning around, he saw a towering giant.  
It was the man from the other day; he was wearing a Suiko pelt.

"Dukaran-dono. I'm intruding upon your festivities."

Argosh's subordinates looked slightly tense.  
Argosh nodded and shifted slightly to the side; seeing this, they also
shifted their positions.  
Since then, he had hardly spoken to Dukaran.  
Even if he thanked him, Dukaran would dismiss it saying there was no
need. He hadn't approached or spoken to Argosh.

So, when Dukaran came, Argosh was inwardly relieved.  
He poured wine into the empty cup he had brought. The only gift he had
accepted – the same wine was being drunk at various tables.

Dukaran sat down silently and drank the offered wine in one go. Then, he
spoke,

"The wine of the plains isn't bad."

"How about some sweet potatoes for a snack?"

"I've already had some. Not bad, not good either."

"Sweet potatoes are advantageous because they root and grow easily in
barren lands. Although, these are actually prepared as snacks."

Thinly sliced water sweet potatoes lightly fried in oil.  
Masked with the taste of salt and oil, they weren't a bad snack.  
Dukaran took one and ate it while taking the wine bottle. Argosh bowed
slightly and accepted it in his cup.

Dukaran poured wine into his own cup and glared at Argosh, who offered a
toast.  
Then, he briefly raised his cup in a toast-like gesture and took a
sip.  
Argosh chuckled wryly and did the same.

"I'm not admitting anything. Your skill as a warrior is third-rate.  
How did you manage to be so arrogant?  
You were lucky to survive. Pray to Lady Rashelna for your life."

Rashelna is the hunter god worshipped since ancient times in
Kreisharana. It was a belief separate from the Holy Spirit, that had
continued since the days of the plains.  
In Alberan, there is a similar god, Raisena.  
Probably, they share the same origin.

"Yes. If it weren't for Dukaran-dono's spear, the Suiko would have been
a moment faster."

"You should have noticed before you charged. You weren't even aware of
your surroundings.  
If you'd just kept calm, you would have seen me aiming my spear."

" …I apologize."

"Third-rate warriors often mistake recklessness for courage.  
Don't get cocky just because the others praise you. Even just standing
on two feet is something to praise a baby for."

Although he was being scolded, Argosh felt happy nonetheless.  
After all, he was being called a 'third-rate' warrior.

"Leather armor is useless against the Suiko.  
If you must wear armor, use this."

From behind, he grabbed and handed Argosh a steel breastplate.  
Thick, heavy, and without a scratch, it looked brand new.  
Argosh's eyes widened in surprise. Dukaran drank his wine again and
stood up.  
He then took off the Suiko pelt, placed it down, and turned his back.

"Your fieldwork is done, and your wounds are healed. From tomorrow,
instead of a hoe, bring a sword and come to me. I'll teach you how to
wield a real sword, not a decorative one."

"Yes.  
This…"

"It was just a formality I wore.  
Besides, I just delivered the killing blow. The first strike was yours.
Do as you please."

He said that and walked away. Argosh watched him blankly, holding the
Suiko pelt.  
It was heavy, and the fur felt like wire.  
It was strong against blows and cuts, and many warriors liked to wear
it. It seemed that lighter pelts were more common in Kreisharana,
possibly because it was too heavy. Even so, it was valuable. In Alberan,
it was quite expensive, but it was worth more than that.

Argosh chuckled as he watched Dukaran’s back, then bowed his head and
carefully folded the pelt.

"My Lord…"

"I've obtained a new treasure… From tomorrow, I'll go to Dukaran-dono's
place."

" …Yes."

He placed the breastplate next to the folded pelt and smiled quietly.

" …It seems he will teach us the swordsmanship of a true warrior."

One day, I will live up to the expectations of the noble family whose
name I carry like a mark on my eyelids.  
I will truly savor the feeling of having fulfilled my duty.
