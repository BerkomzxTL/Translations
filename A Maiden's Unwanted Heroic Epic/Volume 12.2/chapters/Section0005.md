# Chapter 315 - Responsibility 1

Argosh understood himself to be a truly ordinary person.  
He wasn't inferior to others, but neither was he outstanding.

His younger brother, a year younger, possessed talent that others
envied, unlike himself.  
Argosh had considered that the Giterns family should pass to his
brother, but his father told Argosh that he was to inherit the house. He
also told his brother to help his elder sibling and together protect
Giterns and its people.  
He said that they were not merely two individuals, but one entity:
Giterns.  
His brother rebelled and went to the battlefield seeking advancement.

'I should speak with Father again... At least, I believe you are worthy
to inherit Giterns.'

While he was jealous of his brother's talent, he also admired it. Seeing
his brother made him realize he wasn't capable, and he could accept
relinquishing the family head position.

'Brother, I've made my decision. Don't worry. I will eventually achieve
great feats and return safely. When that time comes, let's have some
good sake here.'

His brother seemed resolute in his decision. Argosh gave up trying to
persuade him and let him go because his brother had talent.  
He thought that, as his brother said, he would achieve great feats and
eventually become a renowned general.

However, his brother died unexpectedly in his first battle. Argosh, who
was no match for his brother, heard he was unfortunately caught up in
the main force of the enemy during the battle with Elderant and was
slain by a powerful enemy warrior, it was said.

'…Do not dream, Argosh. There is plenty to do, plenty demanded of you,
in the time you spend dreaming.  
There are responsibilities that will not end even if you dedicate your
entire life to what is within your reach.'

'Responsibilities...'

'That's right, don't be mistaken. Your life is not for yourself alone.'

Witnessing the abrupt demise of the talent he had admired greatly
affected Argosh afterward.  
There are always those above, and even above them, more. The world was
vast, and he was exceedingly insignificant.

He simply and steadfastly did what he had to do. Within his reach, as
much as he could.  
Just to fulfill his responsibilities as a nobleman.

"――Well, but, I was truly captivated by the Giterns Marquis back then.  
His back, walking resolutely towards the dragon alone…"

"Indeed. For a while after that, all anyone talked about in town was the
Marquis. I even learned a song about it."

"Watch your words here. It wasn't a dragon, but a holy spirit. And, as
I've said many times, it wasn't some heroic act like people say. He was
terrified and his legs were shaking."

As they entered Arna and climbed the mountain path to Kreisharana, the
escort men spoke of Argosh.  
The story of Argosh, who had fearlessly gone to the dragon alone, had
spread from the fort's soldiers to the populace.  
The story grew with each telling, exaggerating the tale into that of a
noble who was not afraid of dragons for the sake of the people.

While being respected by the populace was pleasing, it wasn't desirable
to be glorified beyond what was actually true. Argosh was a
conscientious but timid, ordinary person. He was different from the
heroes who left their names in history; there was such a thing as one's
proper place.

"That's true for anyone. There aren't many people who could walk alone
in such a situation."

"I only fulfilled my duty as a nobleman.  
It's nothing particularly praiseworthy… It's fine to talk about it, but
be careful of your surroundings."

They were escorts he had a long-standing relationship with; he knew them
well. They were skilled and capable, but their tendency to chatter was a
flaw.

"You hardly ever go on this road, but this is still a mountain infested
with magical beasts."

"Yes."

Countless magical beasts inhabited the mountains centered around
Arbyagel.  
Encountering even one of them meant facing death—he felt their lack of
tension and reminded them. A single company of one hundred regular
soldiers could be wiped out by a magical beast.  
Argosh and his ten escorts would have a higher chance of dying.

It was only because of Alberinea that they were able to calmly ascend
the pathless road, hunting magical beasts. Even if it was considered a
relatively safe road, they must not let their guard down.

"Marquis, the sky."

"Hm?"

Appearing in the sky between the trees were large wings. A griffin—a
lion-eagle knight.  
A strong-looking man landed a short distance ahead, raising a strong
wind.

"Giterns-dono, it's been a while."

"Bege-dono… Did you come to greet me?"

"I'm stationed here at the moment. The captain asked me to guide
Giterns-dono upon your arrival."

His speech had a slight accent, but it was Western Common Tongue—one of
those who had visited Alberan with Vinthril recently.

"I'm glad you're safe. I heard that you went to the battlefield…"

"Everyone is—well, one lost their mount, but no one suffered serious
injuries. It's probably thanks to being under Krische-sama's command."

Bege dismounted with a wry smile, calming the horse that showed fear at
the griffin.

"Linz, you lead the way."

Kreisharana's words. With a high-pitched cry that didn't suit its
formidable appearance, the griffin named Linz closed its wings and
walked slightly ahead of Bege.  
As they dismounted and approached, Bege walked beside them.

"It's a steep mountain path. Don't worry about the horses."

"It's been a long time since we last met… It's rude to talk from
horseback. Don't mind it, I'm quite sure-footed. You're good."

He told the escorts who were about to dismount, following Argosh. Then
he looked at the griffin's back. Five feet tall at the shoulder,
graceful blue wings, a lion-like body, and a raptor-like beak.  
The griffin was walking slightly ahead, as instructed.

"However… I thought this before, but it's quite intelligent."

"Slightly more so than a horse…  
It's considered a beast closer to a magical beast. If you train them
from a young age, they can understand human speech to some extent.  
It would be terrible if they were dropped from the sky, so we need them
to understand; otherwise, we'd be in trouble."

"Raising them must be difficult."

"Yes… Her Majesty the Queen is interested, but taming them is one thing,
training them is another. I don't really want to talk about this, but
some resist, and that's a big problem too."

"I imagine."

The griffin was their lifeline.  
There would be resistance to teaching their training and breeding
techniques. He remembered the Queen's face—the beautiful face of a young
girl and her purple eyes.

'Let's start with something light, a cultural exchange. We can provide
anything they're interested in free of charge. If we're to receive
something in return, the top priority should be magic crystals… Let's
leave the griffins as a small wish.'

'A wish… is it?'

'Yes.  
It's less psychologically resistant to ask for magic crystals in
exchange for griffins than to demand only magic crystals, which will be
in increasing demand.  
Well, neither is particularly urgent.  
The important thing is to bridge the gap first, I'll leave it to you.'

He couldn't tell what she saw or what she was thinking. Queen Kreschenta
was undoubtedly a formidable presence, but judging from her behavior
with her sister, she seemed to be quite kind.  
A kindness deserved a kindness—whatever the case, he had to achieve
results since he had been entrusted with this task.

"You said you want to stay in the village this time… Are you interested
in that?"

"That's part of my role, but honestly, I want to experience your culture
firsthand. The gap between Kreisharana and Alberan is vast… I want to
get to know you better before full-scale exchanges begin."

"I see, that's like Giterns-dono. But it must be quite an inconvenient
life compared to the abundant plains life…"

"I understand that.  
Unless I experience it firsthand, I won't be able to see their culture,
the harshness of life, or what they desire."

There would be a great deal of cultural friction.  
Their way of life, everything was different. Even when it came to
exchange, they couldn't even touch each other if they didn't know each
other.  
First, to know—that was the purpose of this trip.

"You're a serious person. It's rude to say this, but you've certainly
changed."

Bege opened his hands in astonishment.  
"Eccentric" was a word he'd heard often.

"That's my responsibility."

Argosh replied with his usual wry smile.

The journey continued for about three days.  
A distance that could be covered in less than half a day with a
griffin's wings. It was inconvenient to keep them company, but it was
better to have a guide, so he accepted their offer.

Along the way, he inquired about how to make a safe bed to avoid magical
beasts. He learned about edible fruits and herbs. He had been taught
survival skills since childhood, in case they lost their griffin in the
mountains.

There were many areas without water sources, and the basic way to stay
hydrated in the mountains was to eat fruit.  
The tockle fruit, which was rich in moisture, was highly valued. It was
mildly sweet, without any strong flavor; the hard, fist-sized fruit
contained plenty of moisture.

There were also reasons to avoid water sources for hydration, as many
magical beasts claimed them as territory. Bege said it was best to avoid
them without a griffin. He wanted them to leave immediately if they saw
fresh, crushed tockle fruit, as the fruit grew on higher branches, and
the only creatures that would eat them were usually magical
beasts—meaning it was their territory.

He was particularly interested in stories about being wary of magical
beasts. He had heard about how to act in the mountains beforehand, from
those knowledgeable about them, but they thought in terms of magical
beasts, not ordinary animals.

For example, ordinary animals fear fire, but magical beasts do not. A
magical beast that knows humans understands that humans are near a
fire.  
Making a fire to avoid ordinary animals is counterproductive; in some
cases, it will attract magical beasts. However, without a fire, other
animals will approach, so it depends on the situation—even ordinary
bears, tigers, and wolves will kill you when they attack.

Therefore, when camping, it was necessary to mix a substance called
guardian incense. The scent supposedly numbs their noses, and unless
they are extremely unlucky, they will not approach the smell.  
However, after they've seen prey, they will approach regardless, so the
fire should be small and in a dug-out hole. At night, it was necessary
not to stand up or show one's head from the bushes, Bege explained.  
Fire could blind night-vision magical beasts, but it wasn't useful for
repelling wolves, it seemed.

He kept notes of these things, adding his own observations, and wrote a
record.  
The long-standing wisdom—the various things made clear the fact that
they built their villages in the territories of magical beasts.  
Bege was always cautious during their mountain trip, talking and
laughing with Argosh and the escorts, but never neglecting his guard.

Bege had been quite friendly since before, and he had become quite close
with the escorts during their previous trip.  
They likely sensed something from his demeanor. They readily obeyed his
instructions and refrained from drinking much at night.

Perhaps this mountain was like a battlefield for them.  
It would be something he'd want to avoid, walking with them after
dismounting from his griffin, but his willingness to accompany them was
deeply appreciated. Aside from Alberinea's Suiko, he had never seen a
magical beast, but seeing one made him realize how fearsome they were.

The sight of Alberinea easily leaping from the mountain-sized dragon's
back.  
He was shocked to see Alberinea, but they were still monsters that could
not be called mere beasts.  
Argosh and Alberinea were different, calmly hunting such monsters and
traveling through the pathless mountains.  
Their lives, living alongside such monsters, must have been harsh.

"Thank you again, Bege-dono. You were a great help."

Argosh thanked him as the entrance to the village came into view.

"It's thanks for the previous guidance. Thanks to you, I had a very
enjoyable trip."

"No, I put you on a dangerous journey… Cax."

"Yes."

The escort, Cax, brought a bottle of alcohol from the carriage.

"It's a small token, hardly worth the favor… It's good liquor. Please
have one."

"I couldn't. Guiding you is my job."

"I learned so much beyond that."

He scratched his head hesitantly, looking around. Then, he spoke in a
whisper.

"Receiving something expensive like this can cause a lot of trouble.  
It's Kreisharana's teaching to value simple living."

"I see…"

"So, I'd appreciate it if I could have it when I visit tonight…"

"Haha, even the liquor-loving Bege-dono has it tough.  
Understood. Then, I'll let you have it then."

And so, he went further with Bege.  
If the men were half-naked, the women were in what looked like
underwear—it would take a while to get used to that.  
Their eyes showed curiosity, slight apprehension, and dislike,
particularly from the men.

"I'm sorry. Apparently, many still oppose exchanges with Alberan…  
Though, if it were Krische-sama…"

"Of course, centuries of separation. It's not something that can be done
overnight."

The village was mostly made of wooden huts, with few earth walls.  
Because the humidity was somewhat high, the eaves were slightly raised,
and every house had a small staircase.  
Children, both boys and girls, were engaged in what looked like
hand-to-hand combat training.  
The work separation seemed to start only after they grew up a little.  
Young men and boys were practicing spear thrusting in a nearby vacant
lot.  
Girls of the same age were sorting mountain vegetables and fruits,
butchering animals, or washing clothes, similar to scenes in any other
village.

The only unusual thing was that almost all the men were training.

"…Are the men of Kreisharana largely divided into warriors and
retainers?"

"Yes. Those over there are retainer apprentices—those who don't become
retainers and are over eighteen can't become warriors or retainers for
life.  
Everyone is desperate."

"What happens if they fail?"

"They become craftsmen. They make weapons, build houses… The problem is
simply that they are unpopular. Many spend their lives unmarried."

Bege explained that those who couldn't fight were considered worthless.

"Things are better now…  
In the past, marriage was forbidden for anyone other than warriors. Now,
if the woman accepts, they can have a wife even if they are retainers or
craftsmen…"

"I see. It's not common."

"The common assessment is that they're gutless and can't even become
retainers. At least, the trials aren't particularly difficult."

Bege pointed at the surrounding forest as he spoke.

"The opportunity comes only once in a lifetime. Before they turn
eighteen, they enter the forest alone and hunt one animal, or three
small ones, and bring them back.  
There's no time limit, you can spend a month doing it if you're
motivated… That's the trial."

"But it's a forest with magical beasts?"

"Those who run away out of fear of death are the ones who abandon their
companions in times of need…  
Those who train their bodies and minds, learn from the great ancestors,
and have the resolve can return nine out of ten times. Of course, some
are unlucky."

He pointed to a hut slightly away from the center of the village.  
While most of the village was made of wood, this one was mainly made of
earth walls.  
The sound of steel being struck could be heard—there were craftsmen
there. He could see a man limping.

"Killed by magical beasts, or having limbs eaten… No matter how much you
train and learn, it's ultimately luck. No one can beat nature. There are
those who are like Alberinea, but… oh, that's the chieftain's house."

It would be a little way from the center of the village, a little back.
Right next to the large wooden structure where the women carry the
butchered game and such. A relatively large structure, though not what
one would call a mansion, it seems to be the chieftain's house.

The only real distinguishing mark is the aged red bands wrapped around
the four corners of the roof.  
It's nothing compared to the houses of nobles; a village chief's
house.  
This is the home of Chieftain Kreisharana.

The population of Kreisharana is, at most, the size of the town of
Alberan—even then, it must be quite frugal.  
Still, hearing that the chieftain lives in a small house that’s hardly
noticeable at first glance, I was somewhat surprised.

The appearance of a house doesn't exist solely for luxury.  
It's to show authority. Many people judge a person's status by the
splendor of their noble mansion, distinguishing those who live there as
special beings.  
Whether they like it or not, they recognize them as beings above
themselves, worthy of admiration.

There is a clear difference in roles and status between nobles and
commoners.  
From their bearing to their attire and their homes, they exude nobility,
and that is why the common people accept obeying the nobles.  
The poor do not fawn over or obey those of their own kind.

But in Kreisharana, they truly place no value whatsoever on outward
displays of nobility.  
Their authority rests entirely on their title, the name of chieftain.  
This is ingrained in the culture of all the people here.  
Just seeing that, I felt a great difference.

"It's been a while, Giterns-dono. Welcome."

A black-haired girl, helping to carry the load among the women, noticed
me and came running.  
Lila-sharana, the sacred spirit priestess of Kreisharana. Like the other
women, she wore simple wrappings and a loincloth.  
She bowed her head, a smile blooming on her face, and I bowed deeply in
return.

"It's been a while, Priestess. …I’d heard, but it's truly surprising to
see someone like you working."

"Yes, except for ceremonies and festivals, I'm no different from anyone
else."

She chuckled, then greeted my guard, Cax.  
Her appearance… Cax seemed at a loss for where to look, bowing and
staring straight ahead, more rigidly than usual, like proper guards.

"I'm preparing tea. The chieftain is inside… you must be tired from your
long journey. Please come in."

"Thank you… However, with this number of people, it might be
inconvenient. Cax, you wait outside for a while."

"Yes."

Lila, with her womanly figure and refined features, wore this attire.
Although she’d worn furs before, it would be a little stimulating for
the people of Alberan. Of course, Cax would have no intention of casting
inappropriate glances at the priestess when greeting the chieftain, but
I wanted to be extra cautious. You can't underestimate unconscious
actions.

"Um, so it's inconvenient…"

"Lila, if that's the case, I'll give a short tour of the village. You
must be nervous in unfamiliar territory… If Giterns-dono agrees, of
course."

Perhaps understanding my intentions, Bege spoke in place of the
surprised Lila, and Argosh bowed.

"Ah, yes. If that's the case… please, Bege."

"Yes."

After thanking him, Bege, as if to say it wasn't a problem, laughed
brightly and took the guards away.  
Lila, smiling as she watched them leave, invited Argosh inside.

I had learned a little about their culture and customs beforehand.  
I removed my sword from my belt, and Lila smiled slightly in surprise as
she received it. I removed my boots and placed them by the entrance,
then stepped onto the wooden floor.  
It wasn’t a culture where you walk around inside the house in boots like
in Alberan, but this custom is common even in rural villages. It wasn’t
anything particularly strange. It's fairly common in lands that don’t
use chairs.

Following her guidance, I went through a sliding door to the next room,
where an old man sat in a formal seated position with both legs folded.
A shaved head and a full white beard.  
He wore baggy trousers and gaiters, and a fur coat was draped over his
shoulders, but beneath it, you could see a body honed as if it belonged
to a much younger man. He was an imposing old man.

The man, who had been reading a wooden tablet, silently turned his gaze
towards me and bowed slightly.  
Unsure what to do, I knelt down and bowed in the same manner.  
Although I had learned some things, there were many aspects of the
etiquette that I didn't know.

"I am Argosh-Wikel-Giterns, Marquis of the Alberan Kingdom, Chieftain
Arkyrens. Thank you for allowing us to stay here."

"I've heard of you from Vinthril.  
I was greatly helped by your sincerity the other day… thus it is
inevitable. One cannot repay kindness with injustice.  
Please, relax… take a seat over there."

"Yes."

I stood up and again knelt on the cushion he indicated.  
Before me, instead of a teacup, sat a simple mug.  
It wasn't tea, but some kind of herbal tea—as I bowed, next came a
mountain of cookies.  
A large bowl, piled high.  
Perhaps this was the Kreisharana way of welcoming guests—I was slightly
perplexed and glanced at Lila, who gave a bashful chuckle.

"I thought everyone would be here, so I, um, made a lot…"

"I-I see… My apologies."

This etiquette is difficult. Some say that as a matter of courtesy, one
should have at least one, while others say that reaching for sweets
before an important discussion is unthinkable.  
Arkyrens silently observed me and sipped his tea, while Lila smiled
expectantly.

Should I start talking or reach for the cookies?  
After a moment's deliberation, I naturally reached for the cookies and
ate one whole.  
Were they made with nuts? They had a unique texture, but the faint
sweetness of honey was soft.

While I ate, Arkyrens remained silent.  
Lila smiled serenely.  
Was this choice correct, or incorrect?—With that question in mind, I
swallowed and gave a calm aristocratic smile.

"How is it?  
It's a recipe I learned from Bery-sama recently.  
I thought you might enjoy it…"

"Yes, it's very good.  
…It reminds me of my recent stay in the royal capital.  
My daughter caused you a great deal of trouble back then…"

"Not at all.  
Ranka… she was very considerate during her stay.  
She’s very kind, much like yourself, Giterns-dono."

"I'm glad to hear that."

Recalling the image of my overzealous daughter, I sincerely said so, and
she smiled wryly to her upper right.  
Arkyrens had a gentle smile on his face—he was watching Lila. I was
relieved—it seemed I had made the right choice.

"…You seem to be just as I'd heard. First, let me express my gratitude
for your long journey."

"No trouble at all. Thanks to Bege’s guidance, it was a journey full of
learning."

"I'm glad to hear you say so. Ideally, we should have welcomed you with
a celebratory feast… but I apologize for the lack of proper
hospitality.  
There are still many who haven't accepted the restoration of diplomatic
relations with Alberan."

"That's only natural. Five hundred years of separation… even with the
sacred spirit and the friendship of Alberinea as a catalyst, we cannot
simply erase the past grievances. I believe it will take at least
several decades."

"I agree.  
And… when I heard your offer, I was honestly grateful."

Arkyrens looked straight at me.  
It wasn't intimidating, but his gaze was full of vigor.

"I've heard about you from Lila, Vinthril, and those who accompanied you
on your recent journey. Seeing you in person, you are just as I'd heard…
a good person."

"No, that's too much praise.  
I caused considerable delays on the journey due to my own shortcomings."

"The same is true on our part… even though we had Alberinea’s
permission, she is such a person.  
Without saying it, we had considerable difficulties with your visit.  
Shedding light on the plains’ customs and etiquette and taking along
these barbaric mountain folk."

"Barbaric…"

Arkyrens softened his eyes and chuckled.

"At least, that’s how many saw us, and we knew that going to
Alberinea.  
Nevertheless, you treated us as guests and spared no effort for us, and
everyone is grateful for that.  
…No matter how humble you are, the beauty of your character transcends
words and adornments."

"…Thank you."

"Yes.  
And such a person has come to this foreign land, alone, to bridge the
gap between our nations, and reached out to us.  
There is nothing more grateful and reassuring. Though there will be many
inconveniences, as chieftain, I will cooperate as much as possible. If
you need anything, come to me anytime."

"Yes…!"

Still kneeling, I bowed deeply.  
Those were gracious words.  
I had sent a letter requesting a stay of a few months to half a year,
but I was only fifty-fifty on whether they would accept.  
But receiving such an endorsement from the chieftain gave me some
reassurance.

"You said you wanted to pitch a tent at the edge of the village… there
is an empty hut.  
It may be cramped for your group, but you may use it during your stay…"

"No, we are foreigners… We want to avoid burdening this land as much as
possible.  
If you’ll just lend us a place, we will live there. As for food, if you
allow us to forage and hunt, we have skilled people with us."

"…I won’t say no… but in Kreisharana, only warriors hunt.  
Men face death, women harvest; that’s our custom.  
I hate to say it, but there will be those who look down on you."

"I also intend to cultivate the sweet potatoes I brought this time.
Eventually, we will bring a scholar specializing in crops… but they will
probably be a man as well.  
Since cultural friction is unavoidable in future exchanges, I want to
experience such things firsthand during this stay."

Arkyrens frowned and pondered.

"I hear that you are a leading nobleman with a long history in the
kingdom.  
It's shameful, but not everyone is faithful to our teachings. There are
many who have trained bodies but immature hearts.  
Among such people, there may be fools who will inflict unbearable
insults upon you."

"Nobility is not about history or name, but about conduct. In the face
of responsibility, there is nothing unbearable.  
…While I appreciate your concern, please don’t worry."

Argosh smiled and looked straight at him.

"If we believe that we will eventually accept all those things, then it
is a small matter. …I pledge my life to make this endeavor a step
towards bridging the gap between our nations, by the Queen and my
name.  
Rest assured."

We gazed at each other for a moment, then Arkyrens chuckled.  
He then nodded deeply and replied, "By the sacred spirit and the sword."

"I promise to do my utmost to meet your commitment.  
If you need anything, or if there are any problems, come to me… Lila,
for now, tell Giterns-dono about the village and the forest."

"Yes, sir! If so, I too, swear on the sacred spirit."

Lila nodded with a charming smile.

"Fufu, please feel free to ask, Giterns-dono. I still haven’t been able
to repay my debt from the other day… Please let me know if there’s
anything you don’t understand or need.  
I’ll try to visit you once a day during your stay."

"Thank you, Priestess."

An innocent, straight smile.  
Only the black hair is similar. But strangely, I smiled, remembering my
daughter, who is far away.
