—-------

The book version of "The Girl's Unwanted Heroic Tale" is now on sale!

To celebrate the New Year, I'm releasing the in-story map I made.  
Most of the locations mentioned in the story should be recognizable...!

・Map (Basic)

This version omits text information.

Circles represent major cities, roughly 100,000 people each.

・Map (Battlefields)

Approximate locations of battlefields.

Battlefields are grouped together, such as the Hopeless Hunting Grounds
(Hilkintos battle) and "The Girl's Unwanted Heroic Tale."

The title choices are purely personal preference.

・Map (Cities)

Approximate locations of cities.

Most cities appearing in the story are included here.

・About the Alberan Kingdom.

The scale isn't perfectly accurate, so it's a rough approximation, but
the land area is about 500,000 square kilometers (approximately 600km
long and 800km wide), slightly smaller than modern-day France.

While the setting is loosely defined, I avoid giving specific numbers,
but considering real-world comparisons, the population is set in the
pre- to mid-Medieval period.

I vaguely thought it was around 3-4 million people before, but
reconsidering the population and soldier ratio, it feels more natural to
have around 5 million, so that's what I'm currently using.

There are many forests, so the population is fairly concentrated in
urban areas.

Thanks to magic, the harvests are good, and it's a relatively prosperous
and relaxed country.

In terms of population:

Elsren \> Gulshan \> Alberan \> Elderant \> Arna

In terms of land area:

Elsren \> Gulshan \> Alberan ≈ Elderant \> Arna

This isn't relevant to the story's entertainment value, but it's just a
general idea!  
Please use it as a reference.
