# Chapter 316 - Responsibility 2

The village of Kreisharana was entirely nestled in the mountains.  
Its rugged terrain and abundance of magical beasts meant that suitable
land for settlement was scarce, resulting in the village being divided
into five distinct, scattered sections.

The leader is the chieftain, who holds considerable power, but the
system is parliamentary. An elders' council, comprised of past and
retired powerful warriors, exists, and is convened for matters
concerning the entire Kreisharana.  
Decisions are made through discussion within the council.  
Even if opinions diverge, there are no votes; the chieftain's opinion
generally prevails. However, if the council disapproves, they can select
a new chieftain, and the matter is settled by a duel between the current
and new candidate.

However, a respected chieftain wouldn't have anyone challenging them.  
This process has rarely been used.  
In this instance of resuming exchanges, although some opinions differed,
Alkyrens's opinion ultimately prevailed.

It's a simple yet effective system.  
While it might be more difficult for a large nation like Alberan, it's
intuitively understandable for a small group where the relationship
between the populace and the authorities is close, like Kreisharana.  
Although there's a risk of division from conflicting opinions, the
system shows greater stability precisely because Kreisharana values
freedom from all desires.

Under the chieftain and elders are the warrior captain, the guardian
captain, and the great warriors.  
Twelve warriors are selected after each succession, with the strongest
becoming the warrior captain and the second strongest, the guardian
captain, who guards the gate to the path of the sacred spirit.  
Bege, our guide, was one of them and a formidable warrior. They
primarily lead the Lion Griffin Cavalry – aerial warriors – and in times
of conflict, command the warriors under the chieftain and warrior
captain.

For them, the aerial warriors riding griffins are objects of respect and
admiration.  
Great warriors who become warrior or guardian captains are always chosen
from among the aerial warriors, but aside from this, there are no other
formal rank distinctions among warriors.  
The only criterion for selection as an aerial warrior is skill in
handling griffins, assuming they meet Kreisharana's standards for
warrior strength. There are warriors with superhuman strength but poor
riding skills, which explains this.  
Generally, adults are valued for their individual strength rather than
whether or not they are aerial warriors, and these differences are
accepted as roles.

Below them are the squires – those considered not yet skilled enough as
warriors.  
However, their quality and training are incomparable to ordinary
soldiers of the kingdom. Even trainees who haven't been recognized as
squires are comparable to noble children raised and trained in martial
families.  
The surprising population ratio of roughly 90% magic possessors makes
Kreisharana, a village the size of a small town, a recognized
independent state. Anyone who knows this would acknowledge it as a
nation with astonishing military strength, even among the surrounding
great powers. Considering its geographical factors, it's easy to imagine
that a small force, less than two battalions, could easily repel an
entire army.

It's believed among them that the dense magical power emitted by the
sacred spirit strongly influences the birth rate of magic possessors,
and this ratio has been increasing year by year. We should bring
scholars specializing in this field – we can surely gain much knowledge
here that's unobtainable in Alberan.  
This place is a treasure trove in an academic sense.

Exchanges with Kreisharana will undoubtedly bring much fruit to the
kingdom. Thinking of that, my role is very important. I wield my hoe,
turning the earth. I wipe the sweat from my brow with a towel.

"My Lord, there's no need for a Marquis to do such menial labor…"

"More hands are better. In this situation, I am the most ignorant and
unhelpful, so I must at least help with manual labor."

One wouldn't be accepted if they were dressed in fine attire.  
Discarding the usual coat, jacket, and shirt, Argosh worked shirtless,
his upper body bare. He was planting the potatoes he brought, though his
guards repeatedly voiced their concerns, even disapproval, at the sight
of this Marquis, a nobleman of a long-standing kingdom, doing such work.

They know that Argosh is unassuming and unlike other nobles; they truly
admire this aspect of their lord.  
However, even they are uncomfortable seeing their respected lord doing
farm work.

"But…"

"What? Working under the sun and sweating is a good experience…it feels
good.  
More importantly, how's it going?"

"Well…yes, it was a little rough, but it's good soil. It's loosened up
considerably, and the roots will take hold and sprout quickly. We can
plant them tomorrow."

Cax replied while still somewhat bewildered. He is one who has served
Argosh for many years as the captain of his guard. He is sharp-witted
and skilled with a sword.  
Because of this, he is well-suited to leading the planting here. The
other three around him are also from rural backgrounds. This time,
unlike usual security details, a select few with specific knowledge of
mountains and fields were chosen.  
The remaining guards are foraging and hunting in the forest.

Argosh initially intended to prepare the field from scratch to avoid
burdening others, but he accepted an offer of a neglected field after
Lila suggested otherwise. It was located on the outskirts of the
village, far from a water source, and considered unproductive, but
whether it has been tended to or not makes a significant difference.  
At Cax’s strong urging, and knowing it is not good to be stubborn, he
decided to use this land.

"But apart from water-drinking potatoes…we won't know about the others
until we plant them. The temperature is considerably different from the
lowlands."

"This is a preliminary test…it doesn't matter if we get no harvest at
all."

Water-drinking potatoes – a type of potato called Galish. They aren't
particularly delicious, but they are called water-drinking potatoes
because they grow even in barren land as long as there is water.  
They are a southern variety and weak against snow in winter, but the
winter in Arbyagel is surprisingly mild. They were chosen after
discussions with scholars and farmers, and there were a few other types
brought as well, but this was the main one.

"But it's hot. It must be the humidity."

"Indeed…before we talk about attire, I understand why these people are
dressed like that."

They intended to avoid summer and choose the snowmelt season, but this
place was a summer mountain. The wind blowing down was pleasant, but
without it, the air felt sticky. If you stayed still, it was bearable,
but when working, you sweat so much that your clothes get soaked. Those
who hesitated to take off their clothes initially followed Argosh’s
lead, mostly due to the heat.

The temperature difference between the lowlands after the snowmelt and
here is significant. It will take some time to get used to, I think, as
I drained the leather waterskin. And I replenish the water in the bucket
that was brought, frowning at how little is left.

"Keep going for a bit. I'll go get water."

"Ah, then I—"

"It's fine, it's fine.  
Wielding a hoe and fetching water are the same kind of work. Let's take
a break when I get back."

I want to tell them to rest, but they are all kind-hearted. They tend to
continue working when Argosh works, unwilling to let him rest alone.
Therefore, the group works and rests together.  
If they had military experience, they would obey orders, but this
kindness, even though sometimes bothersome, is welcome. I always think
I've gathered excellent subordinates.

With his sword at his hip, he shoulders a carrying pole and heads toward
the well. It's a short walk from here to the well, but it's not a great
distance. It's a corner where craftsmen gather.  
The well at the edge was used, but there were already a dozen men there.
Except for about three, they were all young; likely trainees training in
the nearby forest.

He poured water from the well over his head and quenched his thirst.
Several people noticed him, and a large man who seemed to be their
instructor approached, recognizing him.

"You're the man who came from the lowlands."

This is Kreisharana's language, which is close to an archaic dialect of
the kingdom.

"Yes, nice to meet you. My name is Argosh Giterns."

Thanks to the teacher he had diligently studied with since the tour, he
has a fair grasp of their language. Archaic language is originally the
prototype of Western Common speech – there are some differences, but the
sentence structure is similar, and is not that difficult compared to the
vastly different culture of the Shan language.

They were surprised that he replied clearly in their language. While
raising one eyebrow, he smiled.

"I'm the warrior Dukaran. I heard that you came from the lowlands and
are working the fields like a woman...it seems the rumors are true."

The boys behind him chuckled.  
He wasn't being welcomed. The intention to ridicule was clear, but
Argosh smiled unperturbed.

"That's right, Dukaran-sama. It's unusual in Kreisharana, but it's
common in the lowlands.  
I hope you'll bear with it for a while."

He wasn't expecting to be welcomed as a guest.  
He had anticipated that there would be people who would act this way. He
is being welcomed much more favorably than he had imagined, and it does
not particularly bother him.

The large man, Dukaran, approached Argosh. Argosh's height is neither
tall nor short, but Dukaran is nearly seven feet tall. He is powerfully
built, exuding the strong pressure characteristic of a strong warrior.
Argosh has trained himself, but he is no match for this man.  
Dukaran's height is comparable to Argosh's, but he is taller than anyone
Argosh has seen since arriving in the village, including those who had
accompanied him on his journey.

His hair and beard are roughly unkempt.  
His deeply lined face has sunken eyes that are sharp.

"I thought you were some weakling, but you seem to have trained
considerably. Are you the leader of the people from the lowlands who
have visited this time?"

"Yes, I humbly accept that title. I have been entrusted by Her Majesty
the Queen with the future exchanges between our two countries; I would
appreciate it if you would know my name."

"Ho.  
But mere names are meaningless. In Kreisharana, what matters is the
skill of a warrior. I would like to know your skill."

"!"

He released the carrying pole and quickly stepped back. Dukaran's drawn
scimitar sliced through the air where Argosh had been standing.

"Whether or not I remember your name depends on that. …It's quite
ornate, but is the sword at your hip just for show? Draw your sword."

"Please forgive me. It's certainly not just for show, but it's not
something to be casually drawn in a place like this."

"Are you deaf? I told you to draw your sword. Or are the people of the
lowlands cowardly enough to not draw their swords even when treated with
such scorn?"

What should I do? I can't possibly draw my sword in earnest. I
repeatedly told my subordinates to avoid violence, but it would be
unthinkable for me to draw my sword and engage him in a fight when
provoked. That strike was merely a provocation; he swung it knowing that
Argosh would dodge.

He considers the intention behind Dukaran's words.  
As Argosh has understood, Dukaran has some idea of Argosh's abilities
from that brief moment.  
At best, it is a draw; at worst, Argosh would lose in a single
exchange.  
Understanding this, drawing one's sword out of pride is an easy choice.

It is certain that Dukaran does not think well of this exchange. For
Dukaran, Argosh is an easy opponent to defeat.  
His purpose is to easily defeat Argosh and mock him. In either case,
there is no way that Dukaran would applaud someone foolish enough to
fight out of pride in a fight they know they will lose.

Fighting or running away is the same—drawing my sword here would only be
self-satisfaction. A coward who runs away when mocked by an opponent he
can't beat, and self-defense to avoid being called that. A fight to tell
himself that he fought against an opponent he could not win, for honor.

However, a nobleman's sword is not meant to protect such pride.

"If we were to face each other, I fully understand your strength,
Dukaran-sama. I can only fight you for one exchange, and no more. You
also understand this, without needing to fight. I can't find any meaning
or reason to do so here."

At the very least, the Giterns sword, inherited from distant ancestors,
is not meant to be drawn for such trivial reasons.

"Boring.  
It seems that you are truly a cowardly bunch."

"Everyone is a coward… but if you would teach me, I would appreciate the
opportunity. I will also make time for it again."

"What's the point of teaching a coward? It's a waste of time."

"What are you doing?!"

A voice rings out, and he looks up. A girl on a griffin, from the
direction of the village.

"…Miss Lila."

Lila, with a basket of fruit, had a severe expression. She clicked her
tongue, and Dukaran scratched his head.

"Drawing your sword at a guest in such a place… Dukaran, what's the
meaning of this?"

"It was the result of my attempt to reach out… however, it seems it was
worthless."

"I understand that you don't agree with the exchange with Alberan. But a
warrior of your caliber, being swayed by momentary emotions, in such a
manner…what do you intend to teach them by doing this?"

Approaching on her griffin, she points to the boys behind him.  
She jumps off and, while telling the griffin not to eat it, puts down
the basket of fruit and bows to Argosh.

"I'm sorry, Giterns-dono. …For showing you such an embarrassing sight."

"No. I understand that many people do not approve of this matter.  
It's not appropriate for the Priestess to bow.  
But Kreisharana values strength…it is only natural that you would want
to test me."

"But…"

Dukaran turns his back and tells the boys in Kreisharana's language.

"Come on, let's go.  
Back to training."

"Dukaran!"

While shouldering his small scimitar, he looks at Argosh.

"What's the point of exchanging words with such cowards? It will only
corrupt Kreisharana…please keep those brats away from them. If one
rotten thing mixes in, it will spoil the rest."

Lila calls out his name again, but Dukaran leaves without looking back.
While some glanced at Lila, they eventually followed Dukaran.

"…I'm sorry."

"Don't worry about it. I anticipated this to some extent…past grudges
are deep-rooted. I believe that we can gradually become closer over the
next few decades."

"…Yes."

Dukaran is one of the warriors, second only to the guardian captain in
Kreisharana. Although not a griffin rider, he is respected by everyone
in Kreisharana and is known as a hero who once hunted a Suiko alone.

"…Even though he's a strict person, he's usually admired…he's not a bad
person. It's just that he's originally opposed to the current policies
of Kreisharana, and this matter has aggravated it…"

"…I see."

While eating the fruit brought by Lila, Argosh sat side-by-side in front
of the field, taking a break and listening. His subordinates didn't
speak, but they listened intently. They probably sensed that there had
been a problem.

"There's no need for the Shrine Maiden to worry so much.  
The resumption of this exchange, initiated suddenly with Alberinea as
the catalyst... it was inevitable."

Dukaran is a staunch conservative. He doesn't chase after those who
leave, and through the exchange with Arna, he allows the blending of
cultures. Unlike Alkylens and Vinthril, who originally possessed more
conciliatory philosophies, he prioritizes protecting the long-standing
traditions of Kreisharana.

Kreisharana has strict rules.  
It's said that those who long for the lowlands and flee the mountains to
the plains due to their interaction with Arna, a lowland country, are
not few.  
Especially in Kreisharana, where warriors are highly valued—those who
couldn't even become attendants, not due to injury, illness, or physical
reasons, but for mental reasons, are treated as cowards throughout their
lives in the village.  
While I hear that this has softened considerably now, it certainly can't
be called a good life.

Those who leave have reasons for leaving their homeland. Alkylens
believed that eliminating the causes of this, for the survival of the
village, was necessary; he wanted to give those who couldn't become
attendants further opportunities. People grow. If someone acknowledges
their cowardice, trains their body and mind, and wishes to challenge the
trials again, that determination should be respected and accepted.

However, conservatives like Dukaran oppose this. They believe that the
value lies in the single opportunity of a lifetime, the same as in
actual battle.  
The essence of the trial lies in passing through a pseudo-life-or-death
experience; giving a second chance distorts that determination and
creates a sense of complacency—thinking they can just try again next
time. Can a warrior who passes the trial with such ambiguous
determination truly be called a warrior—can you entrust your back to
them in a life-or-death situation? Even if the village survives for a
thousand years that way, wouldn't it be a different country, not
Kreisharana?  
They questioned whether that was how they wanted to ensure the village's
survival.

Both arguments are understandable, and several discussions had taken
place when Alberinea arrived. And triggered by that, the resumption of
the exchange was decided. It's no wonder that the rift deepened.

"If Alberinea were here, perhaps she might solve it in an unexpected
way..."

"That...fufufu, that may be so."

Lila shrugs and smiles wryly. She was a whirlwind of a presence that
swept everyone around her. Despite being incredibly gentle and
childlike, she befriended a dragon, bridged a gap of hundreds of years,
and easily defeated invasions from the three great nations. She doesn't
even wear the armor she maintained just in case, the recent turmoil is a
distant past—a calm atmosphere flows as if nothing happened.

If she were here instead of me, she probably would have solved
everything with her unreasonable methods. At least, no one would
complain to Alberinea, and few would even dare to.  
Everyone would realize that if she tilted her head in bewilderment, a
childlike logic would be the answer to an adult's rational argument.

If you want something, challenge the dragon.  
She would say, “Making amends for old grudges is a good thing,” and “If
they attack, defeat them.” She was such an unreasonable being. While
sweeping everyone up in her wake, she would solve everything, so it
seems.

"Kukuku, it's wishful thinking. However, this is the right way.  
Relying entirely on Alberinea means we can't have exchanges without her
intervention... the fact that a path has been created is more than
enough. ...Don't worry, I intend to dedicate the next few decades to
thinking about both countries."

"Giterns-dono..."

"There may be such problems in the future, but don't worry. In a future
where both countries can join hands, such problems will surely become
just a small, funny story of the past."

Lila looks at me intently, smiles, and nods.

"Thank you. Hearing you say that truly... if I were more like Her
Majesty the Queen, deserving of more respect, that would be better, but
I am still lacking..."

"What are you saying? The Shrine Maiden is more than enough... I was
saved thanks to the Shrine Maiden just now. Rather, we are putting a lot
of burden on the Shrine Maiden with our affairs."

"No, that's not true. When there are no ceremonies, I take care of these
children and help with other tasks... actually, I have the least to do
in the village."

While saying this, Lila picks a fruit and gives it to the griffin behind
her. With a characteristic, high-pitched chirp, the griffin crushes it
and happily swallows it.

"Speaking of which... do the women take care of the griffins?"

"Yes. Women usually take care of them until they reach a certain size.
Warriors are often too strict in their training. Baby griffins are
especially clingy, and if they don't get enough attention or are treated
too harshly, they get sulky very quickly..."

She smiles wryly and tickles the griffin's neck.  
The griffin rests its chin on Lila's shoulder in a clingy manner,
chirping, "Kyururu."

"Warriors actually ride them when they can understand words to some
extent, and after they grow up.  
After a mount is decided, the warrior usually stays at the breeding
facility for about half a year, living with the griffin. Sometimes a
month is enough, sometimes it takes nearly a year... there is quite a
bit of individual variation, of course."

"I see, it seems much more difficult than with horses..."

"Yes. Once they become adults, they tend to become more aggressive...
and you have to train them strictly, so it's quite difficult.  
You can get seriously injured if you anger them."

My brother broke his arm once, Lila says, recalling the event.

"Even the warrior chief?"

"Yes. The Littgund he's riding now was apparently particularly
aggressive... and kicked him.  
I was still a child, but I remember him laughing when I was worried.  
He said that if he could ride that one, he'd be the strongest."

She smiles, nuzzling the griffin.

"Since you are entrusting your life to your partner, you must face them
with your whole being, understand each other, and accept each other.  
A griffin rider is someone who exchanges feelings and souls with their
beloved mount. That's what it is... and there are many parallels."

"Yes... that's exactly the case now."

She nods and stands up.

"I'm fully prepared to break an arm or two.  
Right now, we are like griffins to each other... if you think of what
just happened as a step towards understanding each other, it's nothing
serious."

He calls to his subordinates, "Let's continue," smiles at Lila, and
offers his right hand. Lila takes it and stands up.

"I may be troubling the Shrine Maiden for a while..."

"No, it's my pleasure. ...fufufu, I understand why Her Majesty the Queen
chose Giterns-dono."

"...?"

"She must have thought that she could trust Giterns-dono."

"Haha... I find that rather difficult to answer."

From the diplomatic front, the exchange with Kreisharana was left
entirely to me—how does that Queen actually see me?  
I want to believe that I haven't been seen negatively, that I have at
least a minimum level of trust, but it wouldn't be surprising if it were
simply because my territory is close to Kreisharana. Or perhaps she is
extremely insightful—that Alberinea's sister.  
At the very least, it's difficult for Argosh to decipher her inner
workings.

Lila shakes her head, laughs, and bows deeply.

"Thank you for your continued support, Giterns-dono."

"Yes, likewise... for the future of both countries."

The night of the visit to the Kreisharana capital—in the mansion's
bathhouse.

"How is it, Kreschenta-sama?"

"Mmm... it's not bad..."

Krische on her right, Kreschenta on her left.  
The red-haired servant immersed in the bath looks at the two relaxing
with languid smiles, and smiles wryly. Then, as if an idea struck her,
she asks:

"What are your intentions regarding Kreisharana?"

"Fuh... they're more foolish than I imagined.  
Just make them happy, and if I can get the griffins and magic crystals,
that's enough for me."

"That's rude. Aren't they respectable people?"

"Talking to them gave me a headache.  
Do they have muscles in their brains...?  
I wasted my time treating them seriously."

Kreschenta says listlessly, "Whatever."

"Giterns-dono seems to like them. It's nearby, and once things settle
down, I might as well leave it to them.  
He seems like a good person, and he's perfect for the Kreisharana people
who have absolutely no negotiating skills."

"Fufu, their atmosphere was similar to Ranka. They seemed kind."

"It's troublesome if they're similar to Ranka in weird ways.  
But even if I get them angry, they'll just hide in their lizard
mountains, so it doesn't really matter.  
If I tease them a bit, they'll probably work hard and manage somehow...
shoulder."

Berry massages Kreschenta's shoulder as requested.  
Although her shoulders are soft and show no sign of stiffness,
Kreschenta often enjoys massages.

"Don't call them lizards. You shouldn't say things like that."

"That's right, Kreschenta.  
Regalave-san is a bit different from a lizard.  
They have big flapping wings, and their necks are very long."

"Krische-sama, even if you say such things..."

"...?"

"N-no..."

Berry says, "It's nothing," with a wry smile.  
Kreschenta opens and closes her eyelids sleepily, yawns slightly, and
glares at Berry.

"More importantly, I'm very tired today.  
You wouldn't understand, but diplomatic work is extremely difficult.
During my stay, your duty is to make sure I can rest more than usual as
a servant."

"Of course. I will do my best to help you do your difficult work."

"Good to know..."

Drowsily, drowsily, in the comfortable bath.  
He never learns that the exchange with Kreisharana was ultimately left
entirely to Argosh Giterns.
