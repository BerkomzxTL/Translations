# Chapter 342 - Charm 1

It was when my younger sister, Berry, was only four years old.

"Nee-san..."

A girl with long, red hair – Berry – held Lazura's homework.  
She had left it in her room when she visited before dinner. The
parchment was densely filled with mathematical formulas. Berry sat on
the bed, gazing at them and tilting her head.

"Hee hee, it's completely beyond Berry, who only just learned numbers,
right?"

"Yes, it's difficult."

Lazura sat beside her, smiling proudly. She excelled in academics, even
surprising her teacher. She was given problems several levels beyond her
current understanding, and at the very least, Lazura considered herself
exceptionally gifted – a genius, even.

Her half-sister was also a clever child, similar to herself, but surely
she wouldn't understand problems like this.  
With a chuckle, she raised a finger and said:

"Simply put, it's about adding and subtracting numbers using these
formulas, and figuring out the answer.  
By making it more complex, it becomes like this..."

"Ah, so that's how it is."

Truly, geniuses do exist.  
Learning this early was fortunate for Lazura.

"This symbol means to increase the number, and this one means to
decrease it. This shows how many of the left-hand numbers there are, and
this is the reverse…right?"

"Huh?  
Uh, yes…y-yes, but…"

"This combination is for finding this symbol…this division probably
shows the order of calculations, and then this…"

Without paying attention to the dumbfounded Lazura, she smoothly
explained her interpretation of the symbols used in the equation. It was
the solution Lazura had been taught, but Berry seemed unconvinced,
furrowing her brow slightly and tilting her head.

"–I thought that was the case, but there are two things I don't
understand. If I follow this line of thinking, the resulting number is
always different…"

"Wh-which ones…?"

"These two."

Lazura snatched the parchment and examined the formulas she had
written.  
After careful inspection, she realized it was a slight calculation error
on her part – it took her a while to understand that Berry had pointed
it out.

A calculation mistake – they happened occasionally. More than that,
Lazura was astonished that her seven-year-younger sister had pointed it
out.  
Her sister, who had only recently learned numbers and letters, had
effortlessly found the pattern in only twenty problems and easily
identified Lazura's mathematical error.

"Even changing the order didn't work, so I thought there might be a
bigger mistake…"

"Y-yes. But your answer is correct."

"Correct…?"

"The answer you came up with is 7 and 83, right?"

"Yes. Um…"

"He he, I just tested it. To see if Berry could actually find the
mistake."

Berry tilted her cute face quizzically, then smiled. "I see," she said,
clapping her hands together, looking slightly pleased – her red hair,
the same as Lazura's, swaying gently.

Lazura had considered herself a highly capable person. But a genius, she
realized, was someone like her sister.  
She could find patterns without learning and solve complex equations
effortlessly.  
Ordinary people simply saw things differently.

Lazura was intelligent, but not a genius.  
Her arrogant self-esteem, based on comparisons to others, had been
shattered by her little sister, and she realized early on that this was
a stroke of luck for her.

The world was much broader than she had thought, and she was merely a
tiny individual.

My father had two wives. This wasn't unusual for noble families; the
Argan family was an old one. Many nobles valued their long history, and
even in a Baron's family, such matters weren't uncommon. Considering the
goal of producing an heir, it wasn't excessive.

It seemed that couples of noble birth often found it difficult to have
children, and the Argan family was no exception. Because of this, large
noble families might have four or five wives, and if a wife was blessed
with many children in her marriage, some would be adopted into the
husband's family and become heirs.  
An heir was a matter of life and death for a noble family. To put it
bluntly, noble society functioned on a system of mutual exchange of
children.

However, the relationships between wives were typically not very
harmonious. There was a difference in treatment between the legal wife
and the concubine, and it was natural to want your own children to
inherit the family. Some people couldn't accept the fact that their
husband loved someone else.

Fortunately, my two mothers had a very good relationship.  
My mother, who gave birth to Lazura, died in a riding accident, but my
other mother raised Lazura as if she were her own child, even though
Lazura wasn't her biological daughter.  
Lazura grew up calling this intelligent and kind woman "mother," and she
always spoke fondly of her real mother, saying she was like a wonderful
older sister.

The first child of the Argan family. Everyone doted on Lazura, the only
child of her father, and she received a great deal of affection from the
adults, making her a very happy child.  
Surrounded by love, she grew up healthily, and those days were filled
with happiness.

When Lazura was six, her stepmother finally conceived, and her sister,
Berry, was born. However, there wasn't universal rejoicing because Berry
fell ill immediately after birth and was on the brink of death. Even
after overcoming this, she frequently fell ill, requiring a doctor's
visit once a month.  
Her mother, who had been sickly to begin with, also fell ill after
childbirth and died within three years.  
To prevent the introduction of evil spirits, Berry's face was rarely
seen.  
Because Lazura began her studies, she only has a handful of memories of
spending time with her sister after her birth.

Lazura seemed to have been a very energetic girl, but her sister was the
opposite. She was taciturn from childhood, rarely speaking and having an
expressionless or severe face.  
She never smiled like a child and spent all day looking out the window.

When asked about her health, she always replied, "I'm fine."  
Even when she clearly didn't look well, her answer was always "I'm
fine." From the age of two or three, she probably had some understanding
of her condition.  
She pretended to be fine because she didn't want to worry others – she
simply didn't show it on her face.  
Her taciturn nature was simply to hide her suffering.

The servants were concerned that Berry might be unwell, but Lazura
didn't think so.  
Having spent most of her life in bed, suffering from illness, and having
been told that her mother had died while she was ill. If she had spent
her days smiling, that would have been unnatural.

Even when she realized that her sister was far more intelligent than
herself, she didn't feel envy or jealousy. This was because she had seen
Berry and the way others looked at her. Being highly intelligent was, in
a way, very unfortunate.  
While Lazura was at an age where she could be carefree and innocent,
Berry couldn't enjoy that, had to be considerate, and was even
considered strange for not being childlike.

After seeing her sister's smile, Lazura started visiting her room
frequently and began talking to her more. Her sister's surroundings
weren't good.  
She felt that she, as an older sister, should change things.

"...I tried talking, as you suggested, Nee-san, but I didn't know what
to say. Since you always clean my room, I thought I'd talk about that… I
felt there was always a lot of wasted effort, so I thought that if we
did this, it would be faster…"

"I-I see…"

"Then I seem to have angered Celis…"

However, things didn't always go smoothly.  
When advised to talk to other people, she took it to extremes. She even
instructed older servants on their work, which was quite troublesome.

Celis, who was already a difficult servant, was furious.  
Even for an ojou-sama, her comments were insulting, and Celis was
furious, demanding a change of roles.  
Berry's words were probably not wrong, but most people would be annoyed
if a five-year-old criticized their work.  
Simply blaming Celis would be cruel.

"Did I say something to anger her?"

"That's not quite it… I don't know how to say it. It's probably a matter
of how you say it."

"How you say it…"

"Yes.  
While Celis's methods might have been inefficient, she has been trying
hard to make you comfortable in your room, right?"

"Um… yes."

Berry nodded from her bed, tilting her head.

"If you tell them their work is inefficient, it's natural for them to be
upset. Celis may have been inefficient, but she might have been working
hard for you…"

"…I see…?"

"When you convey something, you must consider how the other person will
receive it."

Sitting beside her, I traced my index finger across her pink lips.  
The touch was incredibly soft, everything smooth as porcelain.

"I told you to try talking, but don't rush. When you want to convey
something with your lovely mouth, consider how the other person will
receive those words. You can do it, Berry."

"It's difficult."

"It's okay, you're very clever. …This is your older sister's spell."

"A spell…"

As I rubbed my finger against her lips, she looked at me with soft eyes
and large pupils, slightly ticklish.  
She was a beautiful child like a doll.  
Her unchildlike, emotionless expression might be off-putting.  
When she smiles, she's so lovely, Lazura thought.

"Yes.  
So Berry can get along with others… he he, it's a prayer.  
Since you're so cute, I want others to see how cute you are."

"Huh…"

Berry tilted her head and traced her lips, and Lazura chuckled,
wondering if that was a bit too difficult to grasp.

"It's really just a small thing. If you had said things differently,
Celis might not have gotten angry…For example, did you say thank you for
always cleaning your room?"

"…No."

"That's it. Do you say hello properly?"

"…No."

"Start with small things. Like 'good morning' or 'nice weather'."

When I stroked her head, she tilted her head in confusion and lowered
her eyes.  
When I asked what was wrong, she looked at me – tracing her lips with
her fingertip as she pondered.

"That…"

"What?"

"Um, unlike you, Nee-san, everyone always seems busy…so I thought
pointless conversations were bothersome."

"…Oh, um…"

Hearing that, I rubbed my temples.  
It seems my sister thought I was an utterly idle person.

"Even I'm quite busy, you know. I have a lot of lessons, and I'm meeting
you in the gaps of my incredibly busy schedule."

"…What for?"

Berry asked, curiously.  
She genuinely asked that question. It's something that others wouldn't
even question.

"If you're busy, you don't have to come. I'm fine, and I don't want to
bother you…"

"It's not bothersome.  
Your older sister comes to see her cute younger sister because she wants
to relax while admiring her."

"Relax…"

"Yes. Being a sister means doting on your younger sibling,
condescendingly teaching them various things, and enjoying it
one-sidedly. You don't have to be considerate, I come because I want to,
so you mustn't ask 'why'. Understand?"

I leaned in and told her, and she nodded with a quizzical look.
