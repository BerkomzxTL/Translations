# Chapter 337 - Crescent Moon at Dawn 6

The Unification War is over, and it’s been a while since we returned to
the capital.  
We’ve gathered in the reception room of an old mansion in the capital’s
lower town.  
Everyone here holds some kind of position within the Black Flag Special
Forces.

“A covert unit?”

“That’s right.”

When I asked, Mia nodded.

“Using Black Flag personnel, Krische-sama wants to establish a unit
prioritizing information gathering and espionage. The name is…”

“Prepare to be amazed.  
A unit that solves all sorts of problems, the Kurofuyu-tai Papashutan…
also known as Kuroshutan!”

The name, which clearly reveals its creator, met with weary sighs and
exchanged glances.

“From what Usa-chan said, it's like an expanded version of the Kuro
Mimi-tai that Daz and the others ran. We’ve unified the continent, but
various problems will arise, so they'll move across the continent,
nipping those problems in the bud.”

“Something like that. This mansion will be our base of operations.  
I’ll be the captain and in charge of logistics, while Kahlua will be the
vice-captain and head of the field operations.  
For a while, I'd like you to act as a kind of advisor and help guide
us.”

Mia announced, and the captain smiled and nodded.  
Since the end of the Unification War, the captain seemed even older.

“This is my last job as a military officer.  
Ideally, I’d stay until the very end, but…”

“It’s more than enough, sir.  
Krische-sama told me not to overwork you either.”

Mia’s words made us laugh. Even during the Unification War, Krische-sama
was very concerned about the captain.

‘Bald Eagle, eat properly and go to bed early. Don’t stay up late. Mia,
if the Bald Eagle gets sick, it's your fault.’

‘Eh…?’

‘Keep an eye on him.’

I don’t know how many times I heard that exchange.

“…But, well, Krische-sama has a lot on her mind, and we haven't been
fully briefed on the details yet. For now, she wants to recruit
volunteers.”

“…Volunteers?”

“Yeah. The continent is vast, and more people are always welcome,
but…the war is over. Krische-sama said not to force anyone.”

Mia said happily.

“The Kurofuyu-tai worked hard and delivered more than expected, so
Krische doesn’t want to push them too hard—that’s what she said.”

With those words, I felt my shoulders relax. It was a typically Krische
thing to say.

“Krische-sama plans to announce this next month when the Black Flag
Special Forces disbands.  
But she wants to establish the basic framework before telling everyone,
so she gathered those of us she thinks can lead today.  
We’d be happy if you join, of course, but you two were talking about
opening a shop, weren’t you?”

“That’s right, but…”

I exchanged glances with Beltz.  
In fact, we had just recently gone to look at some land.

A small inn with meals.  
We originally wanted a place that served only breakfast, lunch, and
dinner, but the city has various restrictions on land use depending on
the type of business.  
Basically, they want you to minimize land use and only use what's
necessary.

There's no problem if you’re running a typical shop or restaurant, but
what Beltz and I had in mind wasn't a small shop; we wanted something
large enough for hundreds of former soldiers to gather.  
A simple restaurant wouldn't get approved, so we decided to set it up as
an inn.

The capital is lenient regarding inns. Apparently, especially in the
lower town, inns are encouraged to increase the flow of people, and
taxes are lower than for apartment buildings.  
It aligns with our goal of having a restaurant, and an inn isn’t bad
either.

We had been making the rounds, briefly greeting shops that supply
ingredients and doing other things.  
Nothing was finalized yet, and we hadn't signed any contracts. We could
afford a slight delay, but it was a difficult decision.

“By the way, will this job last forever?”

When Beltz asked, Mia shook her head.

“No.  
They'll let you go after about ten years.  
Remember Tenkyoku?”

“Huh?  
Oh…”

“It's supposed to cover this planet in magical energy in about that
time. Once that happens, Krische-sama and Her Majesty can pretty much do
anything they want.”

“She’s becoming a real god now.”

I said, dumbfounded. Anyone who fought in the Veslea War should
understand that there's nothing Krische-sama can't do if she sets her
mind to it. If she can do anything, she really can do anything.

“Exactly.  
That's why, unless you’re willing to commit immediately, think about it.
Krische-sama will be here next week, so you can tell her your decision
then.”

We were at a nearby tavern. Beltz, Tagel, and I were at a corner table,
enjoying sausages and cheese with wine.

“I’m sorry, but…I don’t think I can participate.”

“…Tagel?”

“I’ve made my wife and children anxious enough.  
I've told them this is the last one, that I'll take over my
father-in-law's bakery after I retire…  
If a rebellion breaks out and they need my help, I will, of course, draw
my sword for Krische-sama… but this isn’t that kind of situation.”

Tagel said, spearing a sausage with a fork.

“And unlike the battlefield, this work will inevitably attract
resentment.  
I'd be worried if something were to happen to my family because of it… I
just can’t participate.”

“Well, it can’t be helped. Don't worry too much about it.”

“Yeah.  
We need you to bake bread for our shop.”

I said, and Tagel nodded, putting a sausage in his mouth.  
He washed it down with wine and asked.

“What about you two? You were making preparations, weren’t you?”

“That’s the thing.  
A few years is one thing, but ten years… Koza, what do you think?”

“I’ve given it some thought… and I think we can just run our shop.”

“…?”

I said, moistening my tongue with wine.

“The capital is vast; there’s no reason to have just one base, right?  
Our shop will be the secondary base, while that place serves as the
official primary base.  
We may not travel as much, but we can gather information about the
capital from drunken rants.  
Krische-sama is not very perceptive when it comes to people's feelings,
so she probably won’t think of that.”

“…I see.”

“We can be more like collaborators than members of this Kuroshutan
unit.  
We run the shop, provide them with a place, pick up rumors…  
I think we can be somewhat useful in that way.”

I looked at Tagel.  
“I understand your concerns, but I don’t think there are any people who
would dare to harm the families of former soldiers in Krische-sama's
very territory.  
She is a genuine noblewoman, a true countess even if she’s from a
generation that's only been recently titled noble. It would take a great
deal for someone to act against her family. Any incident would be a big
deal; the risk is too great.”

“I said ‘just in case.’  
It’s just that, as peace-loving citizens, we don't want to attract
unnecessary hatred. Unlike you, I've lived a respectable life.”

“Ha! It's my fault I was raised in the back alleys.”

“Stop fighting, you two.”

Beltz said exasperatedly and nodded.

“Your idea isn’t bad.”

“Right?  
Once we finish that work, we can focus on our shop. I feel a little bad
about not helping them at all and just doing what I want.”

“That's what I was also worried about… but this is a good compromise.
Shall we tell Krische-sama?”

“Yes.”

The following week, Krische-sama appeared before us and gave us an
explanation.  
Having heard some of it from Mia, no one looked confused.

After listening to Krische-sama's explanation, Beltz and I stepped
forward.

“This is what we were thinking…”

We’d discussed it with Mia and the others and had worked out the details
to some extent.  
We thought we’d get an immediate yes, but Krische-sama, sitting on the
sofa, looked troubled, sipping tea. Beltz and I exchanged glances at the
lack of reaction.

“Um…Krische-sama, is there a problem?”

“No, there isn't really a problem… but you two want to open a restaurant
that serves delicious food, right?”

“Yes, well…”

“Then, I think it would be better for you to focus on that.”

She was absolutely right.  
I wondered if our compromise hadn’t been understood. As I was
contemplating this, Krische-sama gazed at the cookies on the table and
said nostalgically.

“It was a long time ago. I was talking with Berry about a hypothetical
situation.”

“…A hypothetical?”

“Yes.  
I wished the Christand family were merchants. If they were, Krische and
Berry would’ve been at peace, unaffected by the war. I think our lives
would've been so much fun.”

She picked up a honey-colored cookie and took a bite, smiling happily.

“Berry told me that if I had to think about hypotheticals, it’s better
to think about future ones… sometimes, we talked about those kinds of
dreams.  
For example, Berry said that someday she wanted to open a restaurant,
like you two.”

Then, she closed her eyes quietly,

“We would secretly make all kinds of dishes, and serve them to all sorts
of people. Krische and Berry would cook, and we’d get Kreschenta and
Selene to help, and Anne and the others could be the servers…  
Just imagining it makes it seem so much fun.”

She touched the magic crystal necklace inside her clothes.  
I had heard from Kahlua that Berry-sama had died a long time ago, but
her soul had been brought back.  
Or rather, it was impossible to hide that from those who worried about
Krische-sama.  
When Krische-sama appeared before us after returning from the battle
with Veslea, she was surprisingly cheerful.

Berry’s soul was still sleeping in the magic crystal around her neck.  
She must have been envisioning that image.

Opening her eyes, she turned her violet eyes towards us.  
Her eyes, like jewels—those inorganic eyes—somehow lacked the coldness
they once possessed.

“I think the dream of Koza and Beltz to open a restaurant that serves
delicious food is a wonderful dream.  
But if you do it, don't do it half-heartedly. Do it with your whole
heart, and only think about making the people who eat your food happy… I
want you to do it that way.”

“…Krische-sama”

“Kuroshutan will be fine as long as there’s enough people, so don’t
worry about it.”

Krische-sama smiled and said.

“I will wholeheartedly support you two, since both of you were so
dedicated to cooking.”

She said she’d come to eat once the restaurant opened, saying nothing
about interfering with their plans.

Because Krische-sama said that, everyone around us got excited and
started handing over money as a contribution to the restaurant.  
The Black Flag Special Forces earned more than normal soldiers, and we
also received lump-sum bonuses several times, but these guys are a bunch
of simpletons who don’t know how to spend money. Only a few thought
about having a comfortable life; the rest splurged on their future
tavern.

Because those guys were such fools, Beltz and I were forced to build a
lavish inn that makes extravagant use of land in the capital.  
Complete amateurs, people who had never run a business, opening a
ridiculously large restaurant as their first venture.

“Oh man, we’ve started something…”

Beltz muttered, dumbfounded, arms crossed on the street.  
A huge amount of materials were being transported one after another to
the empty lot in the middle of the main street, and dozens of craftsmen
were digging holes and processing materials for the pillars.

“We’ve started something… but are these guys building a fortress in the
middle of the city?  
It's too big.  
Are we sure we can handle this? We’re half amateurs.”

“Don’t say that, Beltz.  
We can't back out now.”

It had started as a much lighter idea. When we retire, we'll chip in
money and build a place where the members of the squad can easily come
to drink, a place like that. It was supposed to be a hobby, something we
would do leisurely, as long as the shop didn’t go bankrupt. But by the
time we were ready to open the shop, it had become something far more
ambitious.

‘Oh, Koza. I heard that the architect hasn’t been decided yet.’

‘Eh, yes… well…’

‘Hehe, perfect timing.  
The other day, I had the opportunity to chat with a scholar who studies
architecture, and I casually mentioned it… and…’

Krische-sama brought a famous architect who is commissioned by the royal
family and other great nobles.  
She said it was a small token of gratitude for the advice she’d
received, and he agreed to design the shop for free. That story spread
to various guilds. We didn't even have to go around begging for help.  
People were coming to our small house daily saying, “We'll handle the
construction. We’ll show you our best work.”

Alberinea even brought a renowned architect.  
Everyone must have thought it was a chance to make a name for
themselves.  
Our small dream, the little shop that was supposed to be a leisurely
retirement project, was turning into a treasure chest of a building
constructed by the best architect and craftsmen in the capital. It was
all too much.

Krische-sama was so carefree,

‘It looks like it will become a wonderful shop.’

She smiled, but her good intentions were somehow malicious.  
Everything should be proportionate, and she didn’t understand that.

We couldn't say we were just doing this as a hobby, and we couldn't
stain the faces of all these people who are working so hard.  
We knew we had to do it, but the atmosphere was still heavy.

“Things are going well so far.”

“…? Ah, I can see.  
They're good craftsmen. Their movements are fluid and efficient.”

The man in charge of the project spoke to me.  
He wasn’t young, but not old either.  
He looked to be in his mid-forties — a young foreman.

“I've seen many construction projects on the battlefield… but being able
to do this without creating a hurried atmosphere is a sign of true
mastery.  
Keep it up, take it easy.”

The man smiled and nodded, saying thank you.

“It’s turned into something quite big, but… as promised, it's a great
thing to be building this place with you good craftsmen. If you work too
hard, it’ll make it hard for us to just run the shop.”

“Haha, but since you’re former members of the Black Flag Special Forces,
we can’t slack off. You are our heroes.  
Many famous people were there, but you chose us, and we are truly
honored.”

“It’s just a shop for commoners, so that’s why we chose your place,
because you would be familiar with working with commoners.  
We appreciate it too.”

Many people had offered to help, so choosing who to entrust the
construction to was difficult, but in the end, we chose the group we had
initially contacted.  
The first reason was that craftsmen who work with merchants and
commoners in the lower town would be more understanding. We didn’t want
a building for the nobility or a luxury inn.  
We got advice from the architect, who usually works with nobles, which
helped a lot.

“Furthermore, the real heroes are Krische-sama. Kahlua and people like
her, they’re the real powerhouses. And as for me, and this guy here,
we're just veterans.  
Of course, we did our work, but being called heroes is embarrassing.”

Beltz chuckled and nodded in agreement, and the man shook his head.

“No, of course, Alberinea-sama's achievements are part of it… but my
best friend was saved by members of the Black Flag Special Forces.”

“…?”

“During the Disintegration War.  
He was in a desperate situation in the forest, about to be killed, when
the Black Flag Special Forces company led by Alberinea-sama arrived and
cut down the enemy like the wind.  
When he came back, he was so excited, and he kept telling me the story.”

The man said nostalgically, looking at me.

“How many times did that happen on the battlefield?  
You must have saved countless allies in desperate situations.”

“Well, that’s…”

“Each of those countless lives had friends, family, lovers. Among the
craftsmen here, there are people like me, and if you include my
acquaintances, there are probably more people who are somehow connected
to you than not.”

“You are undoubtedly heroes to us.”  
Saying that, he looked at the working craftsmen and smiled.

“The Crescent Moon at Dawn is a wonderful name.  
With peace arriving, this will truly be your dawn.”

“…”

“The long night is over…  
many will come to this place, to the heroes, to express their gratitude
for last night.  
That’s why we can’t slack off.”

The man returned to the craftsmen.  
I watched him for a while and sighed.

“The walls are closing in, Beltz.”

“That’s right… this is a hero's shop, but we can't let them say the food
is bad.”

“We intended to do it casually, but how did it turn out this way?  
This is…”

Having been manipulated by a crazy princess for decades, this was simply
our fate, and I didn't even feel like complaining.

That's how it is, and Krische-sama makes us accept it.

“…Let's make it the best shop, Beltz.”

“…Yeah.”

The path was already decided, and it wouldn't change.
