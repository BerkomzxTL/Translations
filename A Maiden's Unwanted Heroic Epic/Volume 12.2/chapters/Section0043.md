# Chapter 353 - Krische's Krische: Sunset

—Afternoon.

"If you think that Krische-sama wouldn't be in the kitchen even at
lunchtime..."

"...How annoying."

In front of Selene's workshop, on a table in the garden, sits a basket
and a tea set.  
Two girls, one with gold and the other with silver hair, both slightly
disheveled, eat sandwiches, one in a bad mood, the other in a good mood.
Selene, her cheeks flushed, pours tea, glaring meaningfully at the
red-haired servant. Krische, happily smiling, satisfies her hunger.

"Onee-sama, what do you think? I made these sandwiches, you know."

"Hehe...They're delicious. The sauce has a nice kick."

Kreschenta pushes a chair closer and places various colorful sandwiches
in front of Krische.  
She rubs against Krische like a dog wagging its tail, begging for
praise, and Krische strokes her head, nodding as she looks at the
sandwiches.

The vibrant colors peek out from the cross-section.  
Even Berry wouldn't be able to match Kreschenta's skill in presentation
and visual appeal, a cook who says so herself.  
Sandwiches, a simple dish of filling between bread, but the presentation
is masterful. Usually a frivolous, sloppy, irresponsible, silly, and
clingy younger sister, but when it comes to cooking, she's truly
impressive.

It's not about the how, but the simple, delicious impression it gives
even at just a glance. And the taste doesn't disappoint. Colorful
sandwiches with meat and vegetables, fried foods, eggs, and fruit. The
afternoon hunger is filled with happiness.

"Onee-sama, try this one next."

Krische takes another sandwich, chews, and nods. A delicate soup
suggested by Krische in the morning, and a simple, direct sandwich at
noon. It was a truly good flow.  
This means there's plenty of room for a rich and creamy pumpkin gratin
for dinner.

"Sigh, if you just scold the ojou-sama a little, she only gets
noisy...You cover your ears so you don't hear inconvenient words, that's
why you think of yourself as a sensible person and lecture others."

"A-anyway...The frequency is completely different between you and
me...It's mostly all your fault."

"...Mine?"

Selene blushes and looks away.

"A-anyway, I admit fault this time. But that doesn't mean your usual
life is healthy, and whether it's forgivable is no.  
You need to reflect a little."

"I'm troubled. I'm trying my best to endure and reflect every day..."

"You're too lenient with yourself in terms of endurance and reflection."

"The ojou-sama also makes excuses every time something happens.  
Strict with others and lenient with yourself; I don't think it's
something to be praised..."

"I don't want to hear it from you!"

Seeing this, Kreschenta sighs, saying, "Here we go again," with a weary
expression. Krische laughs and strokes her sister's head.

"Ojou-sama, even if I were to concede that I'm lenient with myself... I
wouldn't put myself on a pedestal and treat others harshly like you do.
I at least have the right to offer criticism—"

"No! Even if everyone in the world had the right to complain to me, you
absolutely don't have the right to!"

"...Is that so? No, as you say, perhaps I truly don't have such a
right..."

Berry sadly shakes her head.

"That the ojou-sama has become someone who scolds others with such
emotion, that she has become so twisted...it is the responsibility of
me, her tutor...It's all my fault."

"You're a genius at making people angry..."

"Well, to be called a genius is embarrassing..."

"I'm not praising you! You know what you're doing!"

While listening to this exchange, Krische eats sandwiches and drinks
tea. The fight between the two (sometimes resulting in the tragic
omission of Krische's food) is enjoyable and heartwarming.

Selene always says she isn't having fun, that she's not doing it
willingly, but somehow it always looks like she's enjoying herself.  
Thinking about it, it's strange. She scowls at Berry, and it looks like
she's angry no matter how you look at it, yet somehow it looks fun.

In the past, it was all as it seemed, all as it was heard. If she
laughed, it meant she was laughing, and if she was angry, it meant she
was angry. Krische was a simple person, so she could only understand
simply.

Fun was just fun, happiness was happiness, unpleasantness was
unpleasantness, and she didn't know about the subtle differences in
these emotions, and she probably wasn't very interested. She felt and
accepted everything vaguely, and recognized what she couldn't
understand.

It was probably when Grace protected her from the thieves.  
She accepted strange things as they were, and then came to the mansion,

—That's what she calls sadness.

It was Berry who gave answers to various mysteries. Berry gave names to
Krische's emotions one by one, gave her the opportunity to name them,
and the world became vast and complex. The time spent on "I don't
understand" became enjoyable. No matter how difficult or
incomprehensible the problem was, it felt like she could understand if
she asked Berry, and that time spent racking her brains and seeking
answers was pleasant.

The human heart is like a soup you can't taste. Various ingredients are
dissolved, and only the colored surface and aroma are visible. Yellow,
amber, brown, and white, you can't tell what kind of soup it is just by
looking.  
But if you understand each ingredient mixed in there, you could imagine
what it tastes like.

Looking at, stirring, an unknown soup that will never be tasted. Berry
taught Krische that such time could be enjoyable.

"What are you laughing at?"

"Uuu..."

Selene pinches Krische's cheek and glares at her.

"Please don't take your anger out on Krische just because you're about
to lose in a petty argument."

"Yes, ojou-sama, taking your anger out on someone isn't good."

"Uuniii..."

Kreschenta hugs Krische tightly and pulls her closer, stretching her
cheek even further,

"It's not taking my anger out on you, it's this idiot who started it
all."

Krische leans against Kreschenta from the force of being released,
rubbing her cheek.

"Uuu... That, Krische thinks she received the punishment Selene said she
would..."

"Hmm?  
So you're saying you kept me company as punishment?"

"Th-that's not it...U-um..."

As Krische avoids Selene's glare, Berry nods understandingly. Sitting
down in a chair, she leans close to Selene, smiling as if peering into
her face.

"Fufu, I think I have a rough idea."

"...Stop making that infuriating face."

Berry chuckles, shaking her shoulders, strokes Selene's cheek and kisses
her. Selene blushes, glaring with a grumpy expression, and Berry traces
her lips with her finger.

"It's innate. ...It's just being natural.  
Why don't you relax a little? If you're envious, try loosening up a
bit?"

"Listen..."

"As I've said many times since then, there's no such thing as winning or
losing, is there?  
Trivial orders are, literally, trivial."

"From the perspective of someone at the top of a trivial order, that's
how it would seem, I suppose. I'm not going to do as you say, forever
and ever."

Selene says grumpily, while Berry laughs in contrast.

"Then, as a servant, is it my duty to be envied forever by such a
stubborn Ojou-sama?  
It seems we will have an endless relationship, even beyond a thousand,
ten thousand, a billion years."

"You've got that time now, I'll make you howl someday."

"Oh, I look forward to it."

Berry smiles softly at the defiant Selene.

As if it were none of her business.  
Krische smiles as she listens to the conversation, and Kreschenta
watches with a weary look.

The sun begins to set, and after finishing tea, Selene returns to the
workshop with a grumpy but good-humored expression. Krische and the
others head towards the farm stretching behind the house. Kreschenta,
who fell asleep mid-conversation, sleeps soundly in Krische's arms in
the clear sunshine.

"In terms of type, even the same human beings have quite different
orientations. Yes...The Ojou-sama is, so to speak, someone who loves to
give it her all."

"Someone who loves to give it her all..."

"Yes, she places value on the very act of exerting her strength."

Berry makes several water cats with a flick of her finger, watching the
surrounding fruit trees and smiling.  
The sprites moving around her feet and surroundings jump and rejoice
when they see the water cats.

"The process is the goal, not the result.  
For the Ojou-sama, the greatest pleasure is to challenge a goal that she
cannot reach even after giving it her all.  
She approaches crafts knowing it's something she struggles with because
the act of challenging itself is the purpose."

"...Krische sees."

"Fufu, as Krische-sama says, if she focused on one thing without looking
away, she could have made a wonderful knife, but if she sees an
interesting challenge, she'll jump around. Time is eternal, she uses
that excuse to have a lot of fun."

Berry chuckles softly.

"While often challenging me to a match, what the Ojou-sama seeks is not
victory, but the process. She isn't seeking victory, so it's a head-on
match, openly stated. For example, even though she knows she'll win if
she uses scissors, she desperately wants to challenge my paper with her
fist."

She wraps her fist in her palm with a wry smile.

"The Ojou-sama's enjoyment isn't in beating me with a stone fist; it's
in challenging me with it, so it is my role to show her paper every time
she challenges me. She sulks and complains, including her regret at
losing – that whole process is what she enjoys."

"Hmm, Krische kind of gets that."

Krische nods.  
She challenges in incomprehensible matches, loses, and each time Selene
gets angry or sulks, but a few days later she is energetic, saying she
will definitely win the next match.  
Her appearance is always fun to see.  
Selene is certainly that kind of person.

"Of course, the Ojou-sama might say she wants a draw once in a while,
but...the Berry that the Ojou-sama wants is surely a Berry that will
relentlessly show paper. Even if I were to honestly engage in a
fistfight, and she won, she wouldn't be satisfied."

Krische considers this.  
From what she's seen so far, Berry has been winning as she should, and
Selene has been losing as she should. Berry makes thorough preparations
to win, setting up layers of traps over decades, even guiding the
content of the match, while Selene charges into the traps like a boar.
She seems to be aware of the traps but leaps into them knowingly.
Tactically, it's the worst.

However, the reason she challenges head-on is that she wants to defeat
Berry, who sets up traps, head-on.  
She has often said so.

Now, imagine if Berry engaged in a match without setting any traps.  
If Selene won, imagining her expression... She can only imagine a grumpy
or dissatisfied face.  
She wouldn't be joyfully celebrating.

"In that respect...fufu, you're similar to Kreschenta-sama."

"Kreschenta?"

Berry tickles Kreschenta's nose playfully. Kreschenta frowns and
squirms.

"Like Kreschenta-sama who says she's great while wanting to be treated
like a child, the Ojou-sama wants to win while wanting to lose...It's
all backward."

It's cute, though, Berry chuckles, shaking her shoulders. Watching
Berry, Krische smiles quietly.

Fifteen years of life makes one a social adult.  
A thousand years, and everyone can be called an adult.  
But even now, Selene is more of a sister, and Kreschenta is a younger
sister.  
Berry, on the other hand, has been an adult since Krische met her.  
It seems like they see things a little differently.

Or what they try to see, where they try to stand.

"...Hehe, Krische might be like that too."

"Well,"

They lean closer, and Krische gets her head stroked and rubs against
Berry's hand.

"Krische wants to be a fine servant like Berry, but Krische loves being
pampered like this... In front of Berry, Krische will always be a
child."

It's not that she doesn't want to be an adult.  
But it felt good to be treated like a child, to be spoiled.  
Probably Selene and Kreschenta feel the same, she somehow knows it.  
A strange feeling, difficult to put into words.

Berry traces her lips, thinks for a moment, and speaks gently.

"Fufu, adults are ultimately the accumulation of childhood. ...A part of
the child remains in the heart forever.  
For example, even I, who praises you, would be a stubborn little sister
who can't be honest if I met my nee-san again, a child. ...It doesn't
change no matter how old you get."

"Is that how it is?"

"I think so. I'll treat my nee-san as an older sister, and my nee-san
will treat me as a younger sister."

With long eyelashes hiding her light brown eyes, Berry smiles happily.

"If Krische-sama met Gallen-sama, your parents, and Gala-sama now, what
would happen?  
Would you still say you're an equal adult?"

"...No."

"Gallen-sama will treat you as a beloved granddaughter, your parents and
Gala-sama as a beloved daughter. If you both find that comfortable, that
will naturally become the way things are."

Then, slightly ahead of Krische, Berry turns around with a slight sway
of her skirt.

"My eternal goal is to walk one step ahead of Krische-sama, pretending
to be an adult."

"Ah..."

Reaching out and stretching, she gently strokes Krische's head.

"I don't want to be overtaken, so please rely on me a lot and let me
spoil you."

Krische stares intently at the smiling Berry and nods.

"Selene always says it, but Berry is a little sly."

"Winning as you should win is the family motto of the Christand
family.  
As your tutor, I must use any means necessary, including underhanded
tactics, to avoid losing to the strong Krische-sama."

"...Hehe."

Berry strokes Krische's cheek, then removes her hand and gestures
towards the surrounding fields.

"As a first step, let's have tonight's dinner. Which pumpkin should we
use?"

"Eh?"

They had arrived at the pumpkin patch during their conversation.  
Surprised by the question, Berry tilts her head.

"I thought you were in the mood for pumpkin, but maybe I was wrong?"

"N-no, Krische was about to say that..."

"That's good. Fufu, if we're making gratin, a small, sweet one is best."

She folds her skirt above her knees and kneels down, placing her hands
on a small pumpkin. Realizing that Berry has seen through her, Krische
blushes and looks confused.

"Um, Krische was looking forward to eating pumpkins so much...?"

"Yes...It's half deduction, half intuition."

Berry puts her hand to her mouth, shakes her shoulders, and holds up the
pumpkin.

"It seemed like Krische-sama was making a pumpkin face."

Krische avoids eye contact, and looks at the smiling Berry and the
pumpkin.  
Berry is still a little sly, she thinks, pouting.

"...Even without any help, Berry wouldn't be overtaken by Krische."

"Well, I'm just doing my best to stretch my legs."

No matter how hard she runs, Berry would always be one step ahead.  
Even if she stopped, one step ahead. Always one step ahead of Krische.  
Even if she goes behind or sideways, one step ahead.  
At a distance she can almost reach, always waiting, always giving.  
For all eternity, that day will never come.

While saying that she's the same, Berry is the adult, and Krische is the
child.  
She offers a hand before she reaches out and calls it stretching.

"Fufu, let's wake Kreschenta-sama and have a pumpkin competition.  
The winner is the one who finds the most delicious-looking pumpkin."

"...Yes."

Berry's most sly thing is that she always gives an excuse to lose.  
Today, tomorrow, and the day after, she will undoubtedly be spoiled.

Thinking such things, Krische sometimes sees the sunset.
