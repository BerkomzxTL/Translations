# Chapter 343 - Charm 2

When Lazura was born, this mansion was quite lively.  
Her father, two mothers, were always around, showering her with
affection.  
Meals and baths, in the beginning, were enjoyed with her parents—a
normal daily life, but something her younger sister, Berry, never
experienced.

Her father loved Lazura and cared for Berry. He brought in various
doctors and even some questionable sorcerers for Berry and his second
wife, but this put a strain on their finances, leading him to be
constantly away from home.  
This unfortunately had negative consequences.

Her stepmother's illness and Berry's frail health were, in a way,
inevitable. However, Lazura knew some servants whispered that "the Argan
family declined after Berry-sama was born," and as a clever child, she
must have sensed the underlying animosity.

"I see… that is indeed worrying."

"Yes. I've been wondering what I can do…"

Speaking in the garden was a blond young man, Bogan of the Christand
family, long-time associates of the Argan family, and now its head.
Lazura hadn't seen him since her stepmother's funeral.  
He had become much more robust.

Previously, he had been a slender, beautiful young man, but now he was
taller, more muscular, having a warrior's air about him.  
Having completed his first battle, his eyes seemed sharper, yet his
gentle demeanor remained.

"…I'm sorry, Bogan-sama must be going through much more. I heard your
mother is still bedridden from the shock."

"The Christand are a martial family. Don't worry about it.  
My father and the others had a noble end, befitting a nobleman. There's
no need to grieve, and I've successfully succeeded to the title with His
Majesty's permission, a weight lifted from my shoulders. Listening to
your troubles is a good diversion for me."

Bogan smiled.

"And on the battlefield, I met the invaluable Captain Gallen. He's
neither a noble nor a magic user, but he will undoubtedly become a
general one day.  
Following him is a sure bet. Not everything is bad. My father, rather
than grieving, would rejoice in such encounters and laugh, enjoying the
present moment."

Bogan, who spoke those words sincerely, was a truly strong person.  
The war with Elderant, which lasted from several years ago until
recently, had been incredibly harsh, she'd heard.  
They had ultimately repelled the invasion and achieved peace, but many
soldiers had died.  
Even among their acquaintances, some mourned the loss of their sons in
the war, and Bogan’s father and older brother had also died—only he,
stationed elsewhere, survived from the Christand family.

Yet, his eyes shone brightly, devoid of any darkness. He was strong and
charismatic. If they were closer in age, there might have been talk of a
marriage proposal, but Lazura was only twelve, and Bogan was a grown
man.

Furthermore, even if he were a civilian noble, a military noble with his
rank fighting on the front lines was different.  
His high risk of death made giving him a daughter in marriage a daunting
prospect, and even though the Christand family had been associated with
theirs for generations, her father would never want that. Becoming a
widow would limit her options, and while marrying him might have been a
possibility before his brother's death, as the head of the Christand
family, he could not be a son-in-law.  
If such a man were her future—a faint romantic feeling was tinged with
resignation.

"I'm fine.  
More importantly… your sister. Even if she's frail, staying in her room
for years must be hard.  
How about letting her learn something alongside you?"

"Let her learn…"

"Of course, starting with something she can do in her room… for example,
even just listening in on your lessons would be fine. Meeting, talking,
and listening to unfamiliar people and feeling the outside air might
make a difference.  
They say illness is a matter of the mind… and in fact, for us magic
users, the impact of the mind on the body is strong. If she develops an
interest in the outside world, her health might naturally improve."

"I see…"

Indeed, staying cooped up in that room wouldn't do.  
Instead of only herself and the mansion's servants, arranging for her to
meet a tutor might be an option.

"Closed rooms grow mold, and stagnant water rots.  
Without change, things only worsen.  
I can't guarantee a solution to her problem, but the role of those
around her is to open a window and let the air in."

"Yes…"

"What, a bright girl like you worrying like this. If you are by her
side, everything will be alright.  
Those who guide others must always smile. That's not just for soldiers."

He stroked her head, smiling and nodding.

"Yes.  
You may be right… I will try my best."

"Ah. I should get going. My leave is over… and I hear Elsren is making
unsettling moves. I must train harder to make up for the rest."

"Will there be another war?"

"Most likely, in the near future… but don't worry. As I said, my Century
is the best. I'll definitely return alive and visit again."

"Yes. I'll be waiting."

She replied, and he gave a powerful smile and a salute by pointing his
thumb to his chest.

Their next meeting was almost four years later.

Indeed, Berry needed a chance to experience the outside world.  
Perhaps she could be shown something beyond the view from her window.

Anxiously worried about bothering her, Lazura forcibly brought Berry out
of her room and sat her next to her during her lessons.  
Being far apart in age, Lazura’s lessons were quite advanced.  
Berry would certainly find them difficult, Lazura thought, and decided
to tutor her, but the difference in their abilities was cruel.

By the first day of math, Berry was already the one teaching, and she
quickly surpassed Lazura in language and law. During homework time,
Lazura became the student, being taught by her younger sister.  
The day Lazura taught her a board game, Berry became the one showing
consideration for her older sister.

Even secretly studying to save face, Berry was still ahead. Lazura's
plan to help her sister study was quickly abandoned; it took only three
months to accept this.  
There are always people you can't beat, no matter how hard you try.  
How many people in the kingdom could surpass her sister in
intelligence?  
Considering this, competing seemed ridiculous, and she easily gave up
that competition.

But, as Bogan said, Berry’s expression gradually brightened.  
Subdued, quiet, her mouth softened—a soft smile, beautiful and lovely.
When Lazura appeared, her eyes would gently soften, like a bud revealing
its inner petals.

"What are you reading?"

"A book I borrowed from Loubel-san the other day."

A little over a year later.  
She had grown taller, but her bed was still her usual spot.  
With a book spread on her lap, she skillfully spun a coin with her left
fingers.  
A pastime—she often did this when deep in thought.

The coin spun brightly between her fingers.  
Lazura had initially taught her to show off, but Berry quickly mastered
it, spinning it effortlessly even while reading.

Berry was not only intelligent and skillful; she had an incredible focus
on learning. The day Lazura taught her the coin trick, she spent the
whole night spinning coins.

"…I couldn't help but feel bothered by not being able to do it well."

The next day, Berry, who had a fever, apologized to Lazura while she
nursed her, leaving Lazura dumbfounded.  
Sometimes Lazura wondered if Berry even knew about boredom or tiredness.

Studying and practicing is a series of hardships.  
Of course, there are fun times, and results are rewarding, but the
hardship usually lasts longer.  
But Berry would simply immerse herself in her struggles.  
It wasn't just effort, something different.

She probably wasn't doing it for enjoyment, and she didn't seem to have
a goal.  
She just did it to become capable, to understand, that was all.  
Like eating because you're hungry—perhaps such desires were less
important to Berry.

Another book lay on her bedside table, her father's collection on the
inscription of magic crystals.  
The biggest change recently was Berry's initiative to go outside her
room.  
Just to get books from her father's study, but a significant step, a
good change.

Loubel was a tutor who visited the mansion.  
A mathematics tutor, but also a magician, who had studied intensively
with a master in the royal capital, and had published several books
related to magic.  
The book Berry possessed was written by him.

Mathematics and magic seemed completely different but were quite closely
related. He highly valued Berry's mathematical talent and
enthusiastically taught her the basics of magical inscription, saying it
would be interesting if she was interested. Her frail body presented
many difficulties, but the path of scholarship was open to everyone. He
encouraged her, saying that many scholars and magicians had achieved
greatness despite their poor health, and this was a major reason for
Berry’s recent bright demeanor.

Before, he praised Lazura quite often, but now he was focused on
Berry—Lazura felt a little disappointed, but it was strange.  
Seeing her sister's talent valued like this was somehow gratifying.

Berry's gaze fell on the book, her usual state.  
It was as if the world had shrunk to just the book and herself as she
turned the pages, studying the descriptions of the rituals.  
Her face when immersed in something.  
She was doing this while calmly spinning a coin, something beyond
Lazura's understanding.

"Ah…"

"Since nee-san came, it's time to stop."

Taking the book and the coin, Berry looked surprised. Lazura glared at
her.

"You weren't staying up late, were you?"

"Um…"

Berry avoided her gaze.  
Lazura sighed.  
She then looked at the page Berry had been reading and frowned.  
It was a level of ritual description that Lazura, who only knew the
basics, couldn't understand at all.

"…I was a little curious."

"Of course, you would be curious about everything.  
I wonder how you can stare at this incomprehensible formula all day."

"Incomprehensible…"

"It is for your older sister. Loubel-san didn't tell you to memorize it,
did he? He just showed you that these advanced formulas exist, right?
Are you the type that can't rest until you have solved everything that
piques your curiosity?"

"Not to that extent…"

Berry spoke hesitantly, but Lazura thought it quite possible.  
A single word, "curious," made her immerse herself without restraint.  
Sighing again, Berry traced her lips with her fingertip, seeming to
think. Then, she looked up at Lazura anxiously.

"Are… are you angry?"

"I'm not angry, I'm scolding you."

Lazura sat on the bed and stroked her head, and Berry looked relieved.

"I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.  
Studying hard is good, and it's wonderful, but everything in moderation.
Eat plenty of food, and sleep properly, and then study, and I’ll be at
ease. That’s what matters."

Berry nodded, and Lazura smiled, stroking her cheek.  
Soft, smooth—tracing her lips with her thumb, she leaned closer and
continued.

"I'm not angry.  
… I scold you because you are important to me. Do you understand?"

Berry nodded again, gazing at Lazura's finger and hand tracing her lip,
her eyes narrowing.  
Lowering her long eyelashes, she gently leaned her cheek against her
palm.  
The gesture, almost a plea for affection, was unbearably endearing.
Lazura kissed her forehead and smiled.  
Taking off her shoes, she got on the bed and lifted Berry's light body
onto her lap.

"You are the cutest sister in the world.  
Of course, I have my likes and dislikes, but even if I hated everyone in
the world, I would never hate you… so rest assured."

"Yes…"

Lazura gently hugged her small, slender body, pressing her cheek against
her head.  
Berry relaxed and leaned against her. She never asked, but she felt
secure when Lazura did this.

A child who dislikes being pampered.  
It's common for children to feel like the world belongs to them.  
Their wants are met, they're comforted when they cry, and gently cared
for when they're in pain.  
But for Berry, Lazura came much later in the line of things.

Her immersion to the point of illness might stem from this.  
Even normal desires she couldn't suppress were put aside for something
else. A single word, "curious," or "I don't understand," would push
those desires to the back.  
Tiredness or sleepiness came only at the very end.  
She would immerse herself until she lost consciousness. Perhaps her
senses had become numb from always being in pain since birth.  
She underestimated herself far too much.

Enjoying the feel of her long, smooth hair, Lazura said,

"You can be more spoiled, Berry. I want to spoil you so much, until it's
overflowing."

"Overflowing…"

"Yes, overflowing.  
Younger sisters must obey their older sisters.  
I want to pamper you, so you just have to obey without thinking, don't
you like it?"

Berry again traced her lips with her fingertip. After a moment, she
softly whispered, "No," and reached behind her.  
She gently pulled Lazura's head closer and rubbed her cheek against
hers.  
Lazura chuckled at her sister's actions and asked,

"So, what were you curious about?"

"The ritual inscription in a book similar to the one called 'The Mystic
Thief’ from Father's library was different, and I was thinking about
their differences. Both use multiple magic crystals in a linked system…
like the mechanism used in bath conduits."

"A bath?"

"Yes. It's a structure that combines pressure changes to draw water,
temperature changes, and monitoring...  
the bath is just an example, the ritual has many applications… but the
different approaches bothered me…"

Then Berry started to explain her analysis.  
Berry's discussion, not even seven years old, was that of a scholar.  
Lazura only understood the basics; the specifics were beyond her
comprehension. But Berry seemed so happy, Lazura couldn't stop her, and
she just nodded and stroked her head.

Berry's mother—Lazura's stepmother—had a similar aura.  
When alone, she would always read books in a sunny spot.  
Those books were probably hers.  
Her father enjoyed books, but he wasn't interested in magic.

The sight of her stepmother quietly tracing words with her intelligent
eyes was beautiful, even to Lazura's childish eyes. When Lazura asked
silly questions, her stepmother would always smile gently and answer
them fluently.  
To young Lazura, she seemed to know everything in the world.  
Lazura, who didn't like studying, became motivated because she admired
her stepmother.

Berry probably had little memory of her mother.  
But their mannerisms were strikingly similar, and Lazura couldn't help
but feel they were mother and daughter.  
She playfully twirled Berry’s smooth, long hair and pressed her lips
against it.  
Her sister was simply beautiful.  
If she could just focus on the outside world a little more, if something
about her changed just a little, she would surely become a wonderful
woman like her mother.

"……I couldn't do anything motherly for that child,"

Before she died, my stepmother quietly wept in a barely audible voice.  
I want to tell her someday that there's no need for regret.  
I want to say that my little sister grew into a wonderful woman, so much
like you.

"Um, so... earlier... uh..."

"Are you sleepy?"

Berry blushed slightly, and Lazura chuckled wryly.

"Staying up so late, tsk tsk."

"Oh, um..."

While saying this, Lazura laid her down on the bed and nestled beside
her.  
Gently hugging her sister, she yawned softly.

"I'm tired from listening to your complicated stories too.  
As punishment, you'll be sentenced to a cuddle-sleep... you have to
accompany your nee-san's nap until I say it's okay."

Meeting her gaze, Berry looked a little embarrassed.  
She touched her lips with her fingers—a habitual gesture—and nodded.

"Yes, nee-san."

"Very well."

Berry snuggled closer, resting her face on Lazura's chest.  
Closing her eyes, she soon began to snore.  
She must have been very sleepy.

"Silly girl,"

Lazura laughed softly at her sister and, hugging her close, closed her
eyes.  
Her sister's body was always strangely warm.

A few days later, the old scholar—the tutor, Loubel—came.

Berry, who seemed to have been looking forward to it, returned his book,
saying she learned a lot. Loubel laughed heartily, saying that was
wonderful.  
He chuckled, saying that Berry's questions were about to end the lesson,
and went out of the room to ask the servants to prepare some cookies.  
When he returned to the room a short while later, Berry's question time
continued.

"I think this formula can also be simplified in this way... is there
some reason for this?"

While startled and watching her, Loubel looked at the formula Berry had
written on the parchment with a slightly stern face.  
But after a while, he nodded and smiled.

"No, this book was written a long time ago. At the time, I couldn't yet
refine the formula to that extent.  
...But still, that kind of thinking at your age is truly amazing."

"Thank you."

Seeing him stroking Berry's head, Lazura breathed a sigh of relief.  
It seemed to be a discussion about the efficiency of the formula.  
She thought that a scholar who is eager to learn probably wouldn't get
angry at such a point.  
She had never seen the elderly scholar Loubel get angry since their
first meeting, and she thought of him as a kind person who highly valued
her sister, making her relieved.

Perhaps she should have paid more attention at that time.  
You never know where you shouldn't touch a person.

Berry's questions continued for a while, all about formulas.  
It was probably just like when she pointed out Lazura's calculation
mistakes; it was without malice. She just wondered, and asked because
she wondered.  
That's all it was.

My sister, for better or worse, never looked down on others.  
What she noticed, others also noticed, and what she understood, others
could understand.  
I think she vaguely thought about things that way.  
A benevolent interpretation that she was doing this for some reason.  
But depending on the person, this could be taken as being mocked.  
Even a simple, little mistake was a question for my sister. Because she
didn't make mistakes.

Lazura had resigned herself to it.  
Her sister was a genius, far smarter than herself.  
She accepted it with a mixture of exasperation and decided not to
compete.  
But of course, there are people in the world who can't do that.  
Even Lazura didn't completely lack such feelings.  
If something were even slightly different, her feelings towards her
sister would have been completely different.  
Her sister's talent unconsciously instilled inferiority in others.

And sometimes inferiority turns into hatred, and easily changes into
disgust and malice.

"The Mystic Thief?"

"Yes. It's a work by Rigals-sama that was in Father's study... It
describes a compound formula similar to yours.  
The approach to the interlinking part of the magic crystals is quite
different, so I was wondering... did you do it on purpose, sir?"

"On purpose...?"

"You seem to use only easily understood basic formulas. It was easy for
me to understand too, so I wondered if it was intended as a beginner's
textbook."

She continued, opening Loubel's book.  
With an enjoyable smile, her intelligent eyes were immersed in her work.

"For example, this page could be written in three lines using the
applied formula like Rigals-sama, and this part too.  
The magic efficiency is also significantly different...  
Is the reason for using the basic formula here to ensure redundancy
rather than efficiency?"

"A beginner's textbook..."

It sounded like his tone had changed, and Lazura, who had been looking
down at the arithmetic book, looked up.  
Loubel was smiling quietly, but the atmosphere was clearly different.

"Sir...?"

"So, you think Rigals' description is superior, and mine is inferior?"

"Uh... um... I..."

"What do you think?"

His eyes and tone were like a glare.  
Berry flinched, and Lazura froze.

"Is that it? Tell me.  
You're clever, so you must think my formulas are clumsy, right?  
Unlike that man's work, my book is just a beginner's textbook!"

"…"

He swept the books off the desk and shouted.  
Standing up, Lazura hurriedly hugged the frightened Berry.

"You're mocking me, aren't you?  
Just like him, you looked down on me and laughed?  
That even such a simple thing is beyond me, a second-rate magician."

"S-Sir, Berry didn't mean to—"

"What is it!?"

Loubel slammed his fist on the desk, making Berry stiffen, and Lazura
tightened her hold.

"Oh, that's right, you're right, I am second-rate!  
I was mocked and ran back to my hometown, only capable of becoming a
children's teacher!  
You must find it comical, a genius like you.  
Even my only merit, my intelligence, is only this much, and the research
I dedicated years to is just a children's textbook to you."

His usual smiling face showed an unimaginable anger.  
Loubel peered into Berry's face and asked.

"Find it funny?  
While calling me 'Sir', you were mocking me in your heart?  
Say whatever you want, I'll agree with you…!"

"N-No…"

Tears welled up in her voice, and she shook her head.  
Loubel, seeing that, turned away, his breathing ragged, his eyes
downcast.

"...I suppose someone like me, second-rate, shouldn't be teaching
someone like you. I'll take my leave."

Saying that, he left the room.  
Lazura could only watch him go, could only hug her sister, who covered
her face.

Probably, no one was at fault.  
Even so, things like that happen.
