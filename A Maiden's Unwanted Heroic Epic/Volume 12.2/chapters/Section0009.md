# Chapter 319 - Responsibility 5

Suiko spends most of its time sleeping.  
When it senses something, it wakes from its characteristically light
sleep, but generally, it's only active during the day if it's extremely
hungry.  
They have excellent night vision and possess frighteningly superior
hearing and sense of smell, allowing them to hunt even under a cloudy
new moon.

They are most active after dusk, for about two hours, some time after
diurnal animals have begun to sleep.  
They roam for several hours searching for prey, and after satisfying
their hunger, they sleep again in the same spot.  
They often sleep under trees to avoid rain, but they don't seem to
actively hide.

Suiko is the king of the forest.  
Almost nothing in the forest would dare attack them except for their own
kind.  
It is said that many magical beasts once inhabited this area, but their
presence drove most to other lands or they were killed.  
Only the Ranka and Ran'yoku remain.

Except for dragons, the Ran'yoku are at the apex of this mountain range,
but at all times, only one bird flies in the sky.  
This is probably due to the vastness of their territory—if two were
present at the same time, it's thought they would fight, one being
killed or the other fleeing.  
Therefore, they are like a natural disaster, having no direct impact on
the power dynamics of this land.

Even Suiko hunts the Ranka at the risk of their lives.  
They often acknowledge each other but maintain a distance, protecting
their respective territories.  
The territories of magical beasts are vast—in this mountain range, these
two species of magical beasts broadly dominate and fill the land, and
within the gaps, the Kreisharana have built their village.

Problems always arise when this balance is disrupted.  
For example, if a hungry Suiko from a neighboring mountain attacks a
Ranka, the resulting imbalance ripples outwards, affecting the
surrounding village.  
A single distortion becomes a large wave, impacting all these
mountains.  
Those most affected are the inhabitants of Kreisharana, who live in the
gaps between their territories.

Three days ago, there was a report of a Ranka rampaging a little to the
west.  
The Shishiwashi cavalry searches for Suiko around the village and Ranka
further away.  
The Ranka, said to have reached heights of sixty feet in the past, is
nearly twice as large as the massive Suiko.  
Their territories are ideal landmarks; when they and the Suiko fight,
the surrounding trees are inevitably knocked down, making it immediately
apparent.

Further west—many beasts fled from the Ran'yoku flying in the sky and
began encroaching on other territories.  
The movement of magical beasts is particularly rapid, and the spread of
disturbance is proportional to it.

The entire village is tense, and the women are now sleeping in the
warehouses.  
They are not gathering or hunting, and even cooking and eating are done
centrally in the village.  
Even Lila and some of the women who usually care for and ride griffins
are taking to the air during the day, ensuring someone is always in the
sky.

However, even this seems normal for the people of Kreisharana.  
Neither men nor women show fear or trembling; they laugh and spend their
time as usual.  
They say they will celebrate once this passes, and in their free time,
the women are making costumes and decorations for the feast, while the
men are discussing which woman to confess their feelings to at the next
feast.

This is quite different from the atmosphere of a village at war.  
While traveling through villages, I used to soothe anxious residents,
assuring them that everything would be alright, but these people are not
afraid of the imminent attack by magical beasts. They accept the danger
of death as a part of their lives.  
That is the strength of Kreisharana.

As Argosh awoke at dusk and was eating, Lila offered him a piece of
fruit.  
He accepted it with thanks and sat down next to the log he was using as
a chair.

"The fields, the flowers were beautiful weren't they?"

"Ah, yes... yes. Many seem to like them."

Surprised by her calm demeanor in the face of the impending magical
beast attack, he replied. The mizu nomi imo (water drinking potato)
blooms many lovely light purple flowers, and many people enjoy them.

"...You seemed to be picking flowers, what were you doing?"

"Reducing their number makes the potatoes larger at harvest time.  
If they bear fruit, it seems the nutrients are absorbed by the fruit...
it's the wisdom of our ancestors. Here they don't thin out plants
much..."

"Yes, only those that have failed, I suppose."

"Not just potatoes, but also fruits and other vegetables; in some
places, some plants are thinned out before they mature to produce larger
and tastier ones. That way, the remaining plants put their energy into
growth. …The fruit you tasted on the plains was sweet, wasn't it?"

"Yes, very much so…I was surprised."

Lila confessed shyly. Remembering Lila's face as she ate the fruit with
a happy smile, Argosh also smiled wryly.

"Those were grown this way. The price of the same fruit changes greatly
depending on this. Thinning out poorly grown or small ones, putting
energy into the better ones...ah, I see."

"...?"

"There's a commonality."

Thinning out the weak and timid, leaving only the strong.  
Kreisharana’s way is just like the fruit grown in the kingdom.

Conversely, in Kreisharana, quantity over quality. They do not thin out
plants; valuing abundant harvests.

"Their ways are the opposite, yet curiously, their cultivation methods
are the reverse.  
The cultivation method of selecting good fruit by thinning is closer to
Kreisharana's way of life.  
Discarding the weak and thus the strong Kreisharana people are just like
those fruits grown in the kingdom."

That's why they can live in this land, he said.

"Having seen the people here since I came, what surprised me most was
their strength.  
Just as the priestess was surprised by the sweetness of the fruit, so
was I.  
Even now, with the terror of death so close, they all laugh and spend
their time normally."

"Not everyone is without fear... Isn't that true of Giterns-sama as
well?"

"I am a noble. …I am not allowed to stop in fear. Encouraging those who
are afraid and protecting them is my duty."

However, he chuckled wryly.

"There are no such people here. I understand that warriors are like
that, but even the women they protect accept fear as a matter of course,
and yet they laugh.  
It wouldn't be like that in Alberan."

"Death is close at hand. …It is also proof that Alberan is a peaceful
and good country."

Lowering her voice so that it would not be heard by others, Lila said.

"I saw Alberan’s prosperity with my own eyes. There are wars instead of
magical beasts, but usually, without experiencing this kind of fear,
many people, regardless of strong or weak, are accepted and live
happily."

Lila looks at the fruit in her hand.  
It was harvested in Kreisharana's fields.  
Similar ones are grown in Alberan, but they are smaller and less sweet.

"...I was born and raised here, and I like this life. But I'm sure I
would have accepted the same life and lived happily if I had been born
in Alberan. …Character-wise, I might have been even more accustomed to
it."

Lila chuckled softly.

"Some are born strong like my brother, and some are not. Many people say
that effort is all it takes, but having that kind of mindset from
childhood is also a kind of nature. A person called a cowardly
war-averse person may, from another perspective, be a kind and caring
person; similarly, that is also a kind of nature, I think."

She continued, playing with the fruit in her hand.

"Just because they don't fit the ideal image presented here, if they
were born in another land, that person might have been the ideal person
in that culture.  
Thinking about that makes me sad, so I…I wish for a future where such
people can live happily."

"...The priestess is a kind person."

"N-no, I…"

"When I was the priestess's age, I only thought about myself."

She smiled wryly.  
Indeed, that is the nature of this young priestess. However, I am
immature, Lila shook her head from side to side.

"Even if I think for the sake of others and the future, in the end, it's
for my own sake…I only think that it would be good if I were in a
comfortable place. That's why I don't have a clear will or purpose, I'm
weak and indecisive…and easily swayed."

Since becoming a priestess, she said, lowering her eyes and laughing.

"The previous priestess was a wonderful person.  
Stately, yet gentle, and respected by everyone from the heart…"

"...Yes."

"She was a person who embodied the ideal of Kreisharana, and everyone
said that everyone should strive to be like her."

But she continued.

"No one wanted to succeed her.  
Reverencing the holy spirit and devoting one's life to training is said
to be the most wonderful and ideal job, but when the opportunity came,
no one volunteered."

"...That's how it is."

There are no plays, no entertainers visit, and there are no books to
indulge in. In Alberan, for example, building wealth, gaining fame and
power might be great pleasures.

But that wasn't here. In this environment where there is no other
entertainment to refine oneself, getting married to a beloved person,
starting a family, and having children would be the greatest joy of
living.  
Not many people would accept giving up that future.

"The reason I became a priestess was just stubbornness. I sincerely
admired the way of the previous priestess, but I didn't want to see my
pathetic self fearing to follow the same path...deep down, I can't say
that I didn't expect someone else to volunteer."

Lila was a beautiful girl.  
On top of that, she was kind, hardworking, and compassionate—if she
wished, such happiness would have been promised to her future.  
She was not yet twenty years old, and at that time, she was probably
just over ten.  
At an age when she was falling in love with love, it's easy to imagine
how painful it was for her to give it up herself.

"And so, I became a priestess in name only, thinking that even if I
became a priestess, I would change, but even now, I remain unchanged.
I'm just pretending to be a Holy Spirit Priestess…I can't say I'm a
great person."

The way Lila spoke with shame was too pure. Beautiful, I think
sincerely.

"My father said that a person only needs to fulfill one duty."

"Duty…"

"Yes. Regardless of their innate position or talent, there is only one
thing a person should do in their lifetime. To grow good crops, to
support their family, to fight on the battlefield and risk their lives…
whatever it may be, as long as a person has pride in their duty, there
is no distinction between high and low."

It's all part of a larger process, Argosh said.

"Our time is short in the long view of history.  
One person earnestly lives a single life, and yet, in the view of
history, it's a tiny event that is barely noticeable. Of course, like
Her Majesty the Queen and Alberinea, there are those who leave a firm
name in history and change its course… but not everyone."

"...Yes."

"A single lifetime is limited.  
Therefore, to do what one can, to do one's given role with all one's
might...that is a person's duty. And one can contemplate the conclusion
of that when one is on their deathbed, he told me."

Even now, I don't know if I can overcome this lifetime. My father was
such a great man.  
He might just have been a country noble in the world’s view. He wasn't a
genius overflowing with rare talent, nor was he a special being. But my
father was the greatest being to me, more than anyone else.

"I am still immature. Weak and cowardly, having lived for a much longer
time than the priestess, I am often lost and at my wit's end, making
mistakes every day.  
But that is also part of the process…It is too early for me, who is
immature, to seek results."

From my father's point of view, I am still a young man.  
I will be until the day I die. Perhaps in our shared blood, my father is
scolding his foolish son.

"People start with appearances. And the content is something that is
poured into a vessel. The priestess, who walks with the image of the
great predecessor in her mind's eye, will surely become a suitable
person over time.  
The ideal is the guideline that decides the shape of one’s vessel."

"...Yes."

"The same goes for me…my path to become the ideal self who would be
recognized by my great father and beloved brother.  
For the priestess, it is the duty of the Holy Spirit Priestess, for me,
it is the duty of a noble. …Surely everyone is like that, your father
and your brother are the same."

Lila pondered for a while, then chuckled, shaking her shoulders.

"My brother often said similar things. …He said that he was honing
himself daily in order to make his vessel a larger one."

"Yes.  
Surely, a high ideal…it's like having the form of the Holy Spirit
enshrined in one's heart. …Likewise, the priestess will eventually…"

"...Thank you."

Lila nodded quietly. Then she smiled wryly again.

"I'm sorry. I seemed to have caused you more trouble than I should
have."

"No. Thanks to you, I've been able to relax a bit…I’ve been tense lately
thinking only about the attacks. It was helpful. The priestess must also
be tired…please rest a little."

"...Yes."

—People start with appearances.  
Watching her bow her head and leave, he smiled wryly.  
It was a phrase as if to convince herself that would be enough.

—I heard the voices of the Ranka and Suiko at night.  
A roar that shook the air threatened the forest's silence.

"Cax, Daebel's squad, get to the roof!"

"Yes!"

The sound of the tiger's bell resounded.  
Checking the flag of the seventh turret from the high platform of the
turret, I gave instructions to the subordinates who had gathered.  
Eleven people on the turret is too cramped—the positions had been
decided beforehand.

But it was a terrifying roar.  
I was used to the Suiko's distant roar, but the terror of the Suiko's
roar at close range was completely different.  
The scream-like voice and ground-shaking sound, and the sight of giant
trees being broken one after another were visible from this height.

The Suiko was attacking the Ranka. And clearly, it was heading towards
us, cutting down the trees.

Bege and the Shishiwashi cavalry were already above it, and several more
were on this turret.  
Including Lila, women who were used to riding griffins also took to the
sky to monitor the situation.

"—It's coming!"

Cutting through the western forest.  
What emerged was the Ranka.  
Imposing horns jutted out from among the trees, and the hut-like giant
body ran wildly.  
A spear like a twig was sticking out of its back, but it didn't seem to
mind.

The gigantic body of the monster, visible even from a distance, easily
crushed the seventh turret, and the men on the turret were seen tumbling
from the collapsing turret. The men waiting at the edge of the forest
threw countless spears.  
Even those did not kill it; the Ranka charged on.

What emerged from behind it was also a monster. The Suiko, roaring
loudly, avoided the spears of the magic possessors, and when one of the
men was knocked away by its huge body, he rolled about sixty feet.  
An unbelievable distance.

He glances at the surrounding guards.  
Their bodies are tense, their lips blue even in the firelight.  
No wonder.  
They were all excellent, but only amongst men.  
The magical beast was a monster that could easily wipe out a century.

"Don't worry. Compared to a holy spirit, it's just a beast,"

"My Lord..."

"Just follow the training. Even if we fight, it's just to buy time...
The warriors of Kreisharana are brave warriors who do not fear magical
beasts. We just need to follow the training."

He smiles and pats the men on their shoulders, forcefully concealing his
own trembling.  
Then, including the men on the rooftops, he speaks.

"Let me say this beforehand! Even if you suffer grievous injuries,
losing limbs, Giterns will never forget your service! I swear on the
name of Argosh Wikel Giterns that I will give you a reward worthy of
your merit! Don't worry about your families falling into poverty, I will
take care of everything!!"

He raises his voice, asking if they understand. The men stamp their
heels and place their hands on their chests. Argosh also performs a
return salute.

"There's nothing to fear, it's just a big cat and deer! It's nothing
that surpasses man!"

Following the charging Ranka, the men run, and the Suiko also runs
beside it.  
While being struck by countless spears, the Ranka shows no sign of
stopping. A literal monster. And the Suiko seemed to be using the
Ranka's massive body as a shield to dodge the spears.

He recalls the Suiko that Alberinea kept.  
It was probably quite intelligent. He had heard that, but it exceeded
his imagination—the idea of using its own prey as a shield for the enemy
was extraordinary.

A voice rings out, ordering them to stop, but the Ranka charges on.  
He clenches his fist. Bad luck. It intended to pierce through the center
of the village.

Houses were no obstacle. The Ranka advanced without hesitation—cutting
down houses and causing angry screams to echo. The Ranka's speed was
such that even the pursuing warriors couldn't keep up, and the warriors
on the central watchtower began to jump down with spears in hand.

"Locke! You stay! The other two go to the empty watchtower!"

"Yes!"

Inexperienced and lacking in strength—they would only hinder the
fight.  
The two immediately descended from the tower and went to another.
Meanwhile, Bege and others jumped in front of the charging Ranka,
diverting it away from the warehouse where the women were sheltered.

The Ranka passed the warehouse, heading to the northeast forest. Just as
he felt relieved, he saw the debris from the houses destroyed by the
Ranka hit the warehouse.

"Keep watch! Cax, Devel! Come!!"

He shouts, jumps down from the tower, and runs to the warehouse. A large
hole in the warehouse wall—looking inside, he sees children, old people,
and women holding spears.  
There were also young men, probably craftsmen. The elderly and young
men, along with some of the women, were holding spears.

"Are there any injuries!?"

"Minor injuries. What's outside?"

The elder, Beekils, answered.  
His flesh was torn, and his life was nearly at an end.  
The old man, who should have been lying down even during the meeting,
stood perfectly in front of the hole, holding his spear. His eyes and
posture radiated the spirit of a valiant warrior.

"The Ranka has detoured slightly north, the Suiko is around it... The
warriors are pursuing it, Elder."

"The watchtower?"

"My men are in the open watchtower."

".....Thank you."

He coughs and falls to his knees. Argosh quickly supports him.

"Devel, your squad will also guard here until the situation calms down.
…Those who can hold a spear, please gather. We will create a makeshift
wall."

They exchange glances for a moment, then take their spears and go to the
hole.  
At the same time, Argosh entrusts Beekils to a woman who approaches.  
His mental strength was amazing.  
Even though he could barely stand, he held his spear to protect those
behind him.

"Devel, form a makeshift phalanx."

"Yes!"

"Those with spears, stand behind these people, and thrust your spears
through the gaps in their bodies. If we create a wall without gaps with
spears, at least they won't get in from here."

".....As this... person says..."

Beekils coughs and looks at Argosh.

"....Thank you."

"Thank you? …It's only natural."

Devel and the others hold their spears, and those behind them thrust
their spearheads through the gaps.  
As he watches, he hears the sound of griffin wings—it was Lila.

"Giterns-dono, how are the people inside?"

"They seem to be safe, a few minor injuries.  
There are no major problems for now."

"That's good…"

He nods to Lila, who breathes a sigh of relief in front of the
warehouse—in the central square. Then he looks beside him.

"Cax, climb another empty watchtower. Go quickly."

"As ordered, let's go!"

Watching Cax and the others run, Argosh asks Lila.

"The Ranka and the Suiko?"

"Northeast—both towards the second watchtower. The warriors are chasing
them, so probably—"

Just as she was about to finish her sentence, the bell rings again from
the west.

"My Lord! Another Suiko is coming through the previous path!"

"…"

"Escape quickly!"

He looks west—it was quite a distance away, but he realized it because
he saw the gleam of its eyes shining even in the night.  
He instinctively understood that it recognized Argosh.  
A chilling cold ran down his spine.

To his immediate left is the warehouse—the figures of Devel and the
others holding spears. The Suiko, having found its prey, will
undoubtedly come here.  
If Argosh hides here, the Suiko will naturally follow him through this
path and realize that there are people here. In that case, which will it
target?

"Priestess, to the sky."

"But—"

"If I die, please tell my wife that her husband fought bravely and
died."

"…"

After a brief pause, the sound of griffin wings.

"...Understood, may you be safe."

Suppressing his trembling, he picks up and grips the wine bottle hanging
from his waist.  
Then, from his left hip, he draws his ancestral sword. The Giterns'
heirloom sword, passed down for generations, was polished to perfection
with almost no flaws. It had been passed down like this for three
hundred years.

This sword was the symbol of Giterns. The Giterns were not a warrior
family, and they did not value wielding a sword for honor.  
This was merely a symbol of protection for the weak. Drawing and
wielding this sword was only done when the head of the family would
stake their life to fulfill their duty.

"...Giterns-dono"

"Rest assured, I will definitely buy time."

He tells Devel, who is holding his spear, and takes a half-sword stance.
With light, running steps—but with surprising speed—he faces the
approaching Suiko, aware of it, and takes a deep breath. Tension
shallows the breath, loosening the stiffness of his stance, he takes a
deep breath and slowly exhales.

He closed his eyes for a moment.  
He imagined the beautiful sword wielded by his younger brother. The
Giterns' sword, chasing after the ideals his brother spoke of. He prayed
that the sword always reflected in his eyelids would overlap with this
one in his hand just at this moment.

Opening his eyes, he faced the Suiko that had already completely started
its dash.

"...That is my duty."

To be the ideal nobleman his younger brother loved.
