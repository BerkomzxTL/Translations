# Chapter 335 - Crescent Moon at Dawn 4

We must have done the right thing, a small rebellion born of good
intentions.  
But to put it into words, we usurped command and retreated on our own.

Probably, everyone thought this was a bad situation.

After such a battle, nobody complained when training resumed three days
later, everyone earnestly dedicated themselves to it.  
Of course, after experiencing the harshness of real combat.  
The deaths of our comrades were a factor, but above all else, it was
because of Krische-sama.

In that battle, we gained a hazy understanding of Krische-sama as a
person, but simultaneously, there was no room to doubt her terrifying
nature.  
For Krische-sama, killing people was like mowing grass.  
She regarded enemies as little more than talking weeds, devoid of mercy,
hesitation, or compassion.  
Her fundamental way of thinking was completely different.

Including myself, most of us had accumulated a fair amount of
experience. We knew ruthless villains, but I had never seen someone who
could take a human life with such indifference.

It was certainly an act of good will.  
But whether that young lady would understand it is highly
questionable.  
Of course, we also made significant contributions.  
We didn't think we would be executed, but even so, deep down we were
devising escape plans, just in case.

About a week later, Krische-sama visited.

“—Well, Krische had various complaints, but I'm letting this matter go.”

Those words filled us with immense relief.  
To receive a reward on top of that, everyone was overjoyed.  
Well, our contributions… considering everything, that kind of reward was
only to be expected, but we thought we might get killed if things went
south.  
The fact that we received a reward instead of punishment was reason
enough to celebrate.

I even joined the discussion about what to do with the unit emblem,
throwing in ideas.  
About half the unit participated, suggesting various designs.

The density of time, you could say.  
The experience of fighting together on the battlefield truly closes the
distance between people.  
People have different preferences, and there will always be someone you
don't get along with. But even with those who you would never share a
drink with in normal circumstances, we could laugh together, shoulder to
shoulder; that's what comrades are.  
And for better or worse, the Century had all sorts of people.

For example, those who were farmers or whatever, those who never held a
sword, would stick together.  
Those of us who were bodyguards or lived by our fists would stick
together. It was only natural, since we didn’t have much in common.
During training, we were quite divided, but that changed drastically
before and after the battle.

The battlefield reveals true character.  
The fellows who always acted superior turned out to be cowards,
stumbling around nervously, while those skinny, timid kids we thought
were pathetic ended up protecting others.  
It was as tough a fight as it gets, but everyone was a lifesaver for
someone else. Seeing the bully and the victim laughing together,
side-by-side, I thought this wasn't so bad.

I had this strange pride, this idea that I had made my way through the
world solely on my strength.  
Compared to those foolish fellows, I was pretty impressive—a lone wolf
who didn’t need others. Even if I died alone somewhere, it was my way of
life, my kind of life. Not a bad life, I thought.

But why did someone who could be so proud of that lifestyle even join
the army? Now I think that subconsciously, I yearned for that kind of
community.  
I suspect that was true for many others too.  
There were many like me.

Making friends for a night over drinks, buying love for a night with
money, turning into fleeting foam with the break of dawn.  
Yesterday and today are different worlds, but we repeat similar days.  
A month ahead is shrouded in darkness; imagining the future depresses
me, so I spend each day indulging in fleeting distractions. I craved
something certain in my uncertain life, which is why we gathered here.

We endured incomprehensible training under a commanding officer who was
a genius lunatic. Every day, we cursed while training and fighting with
our lives on the line.

But we were making a big fuss over something as trivial as choosing a
unit emblem. I whispered to myself, "Why are we getting so worked up
over this silly thing?" Yet, strangely, I didn't feel bad.

"—What about the moon?"

I don't remember who said it.  
Someone said that Krische meant the crescent moon.  
He was a knowledgeable guy; it was probably Burza or someone like him.

I closed my eyes and looked at the moon behind my eyelids.  
It was so cold it felt like I would freeze, yet it was definitely the
queen of the night, illuminating the world.  
A gentle guiding light at the end of a dark path.  
The waning crescent moon overlapped with the image of the Ojou-sama from
the other day, and faintly, the image of us following her.

"Then the unit flag will be black," someone said.

"Those who carry the moon—The Black Century is the darkness illuminated
by it," someone said.

"Not bad," everyone laughed and nodded in agreement.

It was after the battle with Kuraray Marcellus.  
That's when Kahlua brought the princess to the impromptu victory
celebration. I thought she was a brazen woman, but she was beyond
reckless.

Krische-sama looked utterly displeased at being carried in.  
When she was seated on Kahlua's lap, she silently surveyed her
surroundings. As always, her expression was impassive, making it
impossible to tell what she was thinking. That changed when she started
peeling fruit, as instructed by a soldier.

A drunken party.  
Although I wondered what they were thinking, ordering the commander to
peel fruit, surprisingly, Krische-sama smiled, her eyes narrowed in a
soft expression. Even though she was being made to peel fruit, she
seemed quite happy.

Krische-sama is beautiful.  
Anyone who sees her would agree. Her Majesty is her spitting image;
Selene-sama is also beautiful, and the servants of Christand are all
beautiful, but Krische-sama was more captivating, exuding a
fantastically beautiful aura.

They say a person's heart shows in their appearance.  
Probably that's the case.  
Those with spiteful natures have spiteful faces, and those who are timid
have timid faces.  
I think in Krische-sama's case, her purity is radiating from within.

Moonlight and blazing bonfires.  
Soldiers illuminated by them.  
Her peeling fruit in the center suited the scene perfectly. I had seen
her cut down dozens of people, including the general, in an instant
during the day, yet it felt like a dream.

The peeling work continued for some time before Kahlua called a stop,
leading into a discussion about Krische-sama, the enigmatic Ojou-sama of
Christand.  
Everyone was loosened up, tipsy from alcohol.  
Everyone was eager to hear what would come out of her mouth. Curiosity,
I suppose.

Less than a year since her first battle.  
Even at that time, she likely killed over a thousand people with her own
hands, taking that many lives and causing misery to tens of times more
people, including their families, lovers, and friends.  
It was only natural that people were interested in Krische-sama's
story.  
Of course, I was one of them.

"It's war, so it can't be helped," countless people would say. I usually
think the same, but I still have a bit of guilt, remembering those
things at night before bed, as is natural for a human being.  
Weighing the value of my life against that of the people I killed,
thinking about whether I had the right to live after taking their lives.
I think that everyone does that.  
Before joining the army, especially when I was feeling down, such
thoughts would cross my mind.

Killing a person means taking the life of someone who is the same as
you.  
No matter how you spin it, you cannot deny that.  
That's why I think justifications are necessary for killing people.

For the country, for comrades, for family.  
You had to kill them.  
To think, it couldn't be helped.

Some people can continue killing for their own sake, but those people
must be utter fools or madmen.  
Normal people are not like that, and they get tired eventually.

I was interested in Krische-sama's justification.  
What justification did this girl use to take over a thousand lives?  
How did she escape the guilt?

I suspected it wasn't for her own sake.  
If you were with her at Bernaich, anyone would understand.  
She wouldn't sacrifice herself for her own sake.

Though she is undoubtedly insane, I expected there to be a good reason.

"—I clean the mansion, take care of the garden, cook with Berry, eat,
drink tea… I live like that every day."

It was a bit of a letdown. Krische-sama wasn't a righteous person who
fights with any kind of justification. She didn't care about killing a
thousand people, she wasn't interested in those she killed, nor did she
recognize any value in them.

She speaks her mind and acts as she pleases.  
Many people call Krische-sama a child, but I think it's a little
different.  
Her way of thinking is simply much simpler than ours—she is just
extreme, to the point that she can kill a thousand people without
hesitation just to have a peaceful and happy life.

Honestly, I was horrified.

It's such a small wish. I think most people would pity her, calling her
pitiful and virtuous.  
But conversely, it's terrifying to think that someone would kill so many
people without hesitation just for such insignificant happiness.
Krische-sama—nothing short of a complete lunatic.

Probably everything other than her happiness is unimportant to her. And
she doesn't allow anything that threatens her happiness.  
That applies to herself as well, the battle of Bernaich was a result of
this.  
Thinking that she was useless and hated by Selene-sama, she drove
herself to the brink of death, killing hundreds of people, so she is
clearly not right in the head.

Some people would get angry if you called Krische-sama insane, but
that's still how I see her.  
Without a doubt, Krische-sama was abnormal; she was the type of person
who should be called insane.  
If someone who can render everything else worthless for the sake of
their beloved "simple daily life" isn't insane, then what is?

I think that love, in the end, is about discrimination.  
No one criticizes the desire to make someone happy, but the world is
complicated.  
Making someone happy can lead to making someone else sad.  
Normal people waver over the scales in their minds every time such a
thing happens, but Krische-sama probably doesn't worry about such
things.

Things are always clear to her; it's either 1 or 0.  
Simple, extreme, and without hesitation.

I don't know anyone as loving as Krische-sama.  
I don't know anyone as sincere, honest, and pure as her. I find her way
of being fundamentally beautiful.

But righteous people are much dirtier.  
They care about other people's opinions, desperately trying not to be
ridiculed, bound by various constraints, struggling and flailing, living
miserably.  
Even so, they desperately try to hide their ugliness and strive to live.
That's what it means to be human.

A princess who can trample on others without even knowing the meaning of
struggle and remain beautiful. If you tell us that's the right way to
be, then what are we?  
Thinking that way, Krische-sama was definitely mad.

"Actually, Berry can talk to cats."

"Cats?"

"Yes. When she was watering the orchard, a cat wandered into the garden
and Berry suddenly went 'meow' and started talking to it. Then Berry
translated the cat's words for Krische and taught her how to talk to
cats, and now Krische is trying to talk to cats whenever she sees one…"

No climax, no punchline. Krische-sama only talks about trivial things
that happened in her mansion. Even if you listen to it while drinking,
you won't even crack a smile. She doesn't consider our feelings at all.
We were forced to listen to all these so-called "fun" stories, and the
alcohol we drank was terrible. However, we couldn't complain, just
listen, myself included.

As they say, the name reflects the person, and Krische-sama was truly
like that. The moon, shining equally on everything from a place we
couldn't reach.  
If it's in the sky, it makes sense, but to insist that she is human and
yet blatantly discriminate, that is the height of injustice.

The stars in the sky had faded, and the moon was alone.  
The sky around the moon was blue, painting a small portion of the dark
night sky.

Perhaps, without it, it would be a lonely scene.

That's why a madman is okay, if there's only one.  
When dawn breaks, they naturally fade and disappear, blending into the
sky.

"Beltz, let's wake up early tomorrow."

"Coincidence, I was thinking the same thing."

"We had such terrible sake tonight.  
We need a palate cleanser."

"Indeed."

When we talked about the unit flag, my mind was already made up; that
day was merely confirmation.

To find out why we should carry the moon until dawn.
