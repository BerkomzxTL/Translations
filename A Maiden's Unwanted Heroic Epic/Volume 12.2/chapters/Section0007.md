# Chapter 317 - Responsibility 3

The five villages of Kreisharana are quite far apart.  
While the lack of a suitable area for concentrated settlement is one
reason, the main reason is to disperse the risk.  
Even the Suiko and Ranka are relatively benign among magical beasts.  
In the depths of this mountain range, however, there exist monsters
called Stormwings, which can cause storms and wipe out entire villages
with a single wingbeat.  
It's said that they once nearly destroyed Kreisharana, even with its
strong warriors defending it, and the scattering of the villages
happened afterward.  
Two of the seven villages that existed at the time are said to have been
destroyed by them.

The villages are separated by rugged mountains teeming with magical
beasts. Therefore, communication between villages is carried out by
griffins, with little human travel, mostly limited to exchanges between
warriors.

The timing was unfortunate, as apparently the warrior chief, Vinthril,
was touring the villages with griffins, acting as a proxy for the
chieftain, Arkylens.

“Long time no see, Giterns-dono.”

One night, about three weeks after Argosh arrived, seated around a
campfire under a magic lantern— upon seeing the face that appeared,
Argosh stood up and bowed his head.

“Vinthril-dono, long time no see.”

A sharp, handsome face—long, well-trained limbs. It was Vinthril, the
Kreisharana warrior chief.  
His subordinates, who were drinking, also straightened up, with Bege
even jumping to attention.

“Y-you’re already back…?”

“I heard Giterns-dono had arrived, so I expedited my schedule a bit.
I’ve heard, Bege, that you’ve been spending almost every day drinking at
Giterns-dono’s place.”

“It’s not that I’ve been hanging around… only every two or three days.”

“A warrior of your caliber behaving like that? Tomorrow, show me your
spear. I want to check if you’ve gotten rusty.”

“Y-yes sir…”

They had just been talking about how they wanted to have a final drink
in the next two or three days before Vinthril’s return.  
Seeing Bege scratching his head like a child caught doing mischief,
Argosh and the others laughed.

“My apologies, he's skilled but also a big drinker.  
We’ve caused you trouble.”

“Not at all. Bege-dono has been very considerate of Kreisharana… We’re
the ones who should be thanking him… and it was we who invited him to
have a chat.”

“Ah… Giterns-dono is truly a kind person.”

“That’s… truly the case.”

When Argosh offered some wine, Vinthril smiled wryly and nodded.  
After Argosh handed him a goblet and poured him some wine, they toasted
to their reunion.

For a while, they drank and talked about their recent journeys and
battles.  
A little over a year had passed, including the Five Great Nations War.
They hadn’t seen each other since Argosh had brought them to the
capital.  
Argosh had already greeted most of his acquaintances, including Bege,
and everyone was friendly; Vinthril also smiled continuously and engaged
in conversation.

“I heard from Lila. It seems Dukaran was rather rude… Before listening
to his side of the story, I wanted to speak with Giterns-dono first.”

After a while, Vinthril brought this up.  
This was probably the main reason for his visit—Argosh felt quite cared
for by both Lila and Vinthril.

“It wasn’t that rude. Considering the circumstances… I understand that
some people are hesitant about this exchange. I think it’s unavoidable.”

Argosh replied with the same words he had told Lila, smiling faintly.

“Besides, I hear that Dukaran-dono is one of the most respected warriors
in Kreisharana. I need to gain their recognition first before this
exchange can go smoothly. It wasn't a fight, and this is also part of
the exchange… please be patient.”

“I thought Giterns-dono would say something like that… You’re going to
have a hard time.  
There are other problems in the village, making things even more
complicated.”

“Haha, please don't worry about me. If I need help, I’ll ask for it
then.”

Argosh took a sip of wine and said, “It’s difficult.”

“Everyone wants a better future, but our methods and goals differ. Each
time, I wonder what the right answer is. I’ve also been struggling with
how to govern my territory… I’ve reached conclusions that can’t be
called right or wrong, and I’ve been repeating this self-questioning
every day. That hasn’t changed.”

If you help one place, another place suffers. It’s hard to balance
things and prosper the territory, but financial wealth doesn’t
necessarily translate to happiness.

“A future where everyone is happy is ideal.  
But who is ‘everyone’?”

Vinthril straightened his posture slightly, and the others followed
suit. They gazed at Argos, who was looking down at his goblet.

“…Everyone, you say?”

“Yes. No two people are the same, yet we tend to group them together.  
I’ve spent time and effort traveling around my territory, trying to
understand each person… and even then, I can’t say I truly understand
them.”

Argosh chuckled wryly. “Probably only a tiny bit.”

“Even as a father, I wonder where my daughter’s happiness lies. I ponder
what would be the best way, and all those options seem both right and
wrong. I constantly question whether I even have the right to make any
choice, lost in my confusion… Even though I believe this exchange will
benefit both sides, if you ask me if I’m certain, I can’t definitively
say yes.”

The reason why Argosh isn't angry at Dukaran's behavior is this.  
It might benefit Alberan. However, if you ask him if this exchange will
truly lead to a brighter future for Kreisharana, he can’t confidently
say yes.

“I’ve read books and invited scholars, gaining knowledge of history,
culture, and some academic subjects. But it’s just theory. I don’t know
what makes the people of Kreisharana laugh, rejoice, get angry, or
grieve… I don’t understand anything. If I, who doesn't understand their
culture, were to talk about a better future for both countries, no one
would listen.”

He took another sip of wine and continued.

“First, I need to learn and understand Kreisharana culture firsthand. If
we find common ground… I believe that’s what I should be focusing on for
now.”

Argosh looked up, gazed at the quiet tent, and shifted his eyes
nervously.

“Oh, my apologies, I get talkative when I drink.”

“No. I share the same concerns. …And Giterns-dono is my mentor—your
words are truly insightful.”

“Mentor…?”

“Giterns-dono governs a population that surpasses even the entire
country. To guide them in a positive direction is something to be proud
of.”

“I’m an incompetent person… I just run around clumsily.  
I’m where I am today thanks to many people who helped me. To be praised
by a distinguished person like Vinthril-dono is overwhelming.”

“Perhaps that is the point.”

“…?”

“It's a bad habit of mine… I pride myself on winning the position of
warrior chief through my own efforts, and arrogantly believe I can lead
everyone in the direction I believe is correct.”

“Considering your position, it is not something bad, though...”

Vinthril chuckled wryly.

“Compared to Krische-sama, I’m like a baby.  
There are great heroes like Kolke-dono in the world. I should know how
insignificant I am, yet I, as warrior chief, was about to rebuke Dukaran
for his rudeness.  
It would probably have led to pointless arguments and given Giterns-dono
more reason to dislike us.”

Vinthril took a sip of wine and looked down. Then, he looked straight at
Argos.

“I don’t think Giterns-dono is an ordinary person. But I want to learn
your ability to laugh at your own incompetence.  
While I preach to others as warrior chief, I lack the strength to accept
my own shortcomings.”

Vinthril's eyes held a strong, almost intimidating aura. It wasn't
intentional, but that strength and stern self-discipline, reminiscent of
the harsh Arbyagel mountain range, illuminated his eyes.  
The old Argosh would have been intimidated by the strength in those
eyes.  
The reason he doesn't show such weakness now is because he’s become more
skilled at diplomacy, able to brush things off—and he can objectively
observe his own feelings of envy.

“My strength is perhaps more of resignation. Seeing the people of
Kreisharana reminds me of my younger brother.”

“Your brother?”

“Yes. He was gifted, strict with himself, noble, and kind… a person with
such qualities that I, as a noble, would envy. But he died young in his
first battle.”

Argosh doesn't consider himself hardworking.  
His brother was far more dedicated to self-improvement.  
Where Argosh learned one thing, his brother learned two. Even with such
talent, he always strived to learn more.  
He quickly surpassed Argosh.

Even after Argosh was chosen to inherit the family, his brother never
complained. He respected Argosh and always showed his affection, which
Argosh remembers fondly.

“After inheriting the family and the territory, whenever I have
problems, I always think: if my brother were here, he would have done
better. To fill that gap, I run around clumsily, just pretending to do
my duty… When someone as direct as Vinthril-dono points that out, I feel
a bit ashamed.”

If his brother were alive, if he had inherited the family, if he were
here… he wouldn't have been insulted by Dukaran, he would have acted
properly. Dukaran certainly would not have dared to call him cowardly.
Strength resides in the eyes.  
Like Alberinea and the queen, like the people of Kreisharana, the eyes
tell whether it's genuine or fake.  
Argos's eyes could be intimidating.

“At least to me, that doesn't seem to be a false front.”

Vinthril smiled.

“Strength isn’t just one thing.  
Well-trained skills and physique are strength, but possessing sincerity
and a gentle heart like Giterns-dono’s is also strength… Do you really
think Krische-sama is the only reason for this exchange?”

“…?”

“Not everyone who went on that journey agreed with the exchange.  
Even though they did it for our ally, Krische-sama, many were against
the exchange with Alberan…  
Seeing your consideration and concern for us, many decided to
participate. This includes Bege.”

Bege scratched his head. Argosh stared at him in surprise. Bege had been
the first to approach Argosh among those who had been on the journey.

“What the warrior chief said… actually, most of us didn’t really care
about the exchange with Alberan. Most of us were there because of
Krische-sama and out of curiosity. For Giterns-dono, it was the sudden
arrival of barbarians… but if you receive such hospitality, you'll
change your view of the people of the plains.”

“…Bege-dono.”

“I’m not saying the journey was perfect… but it wasn’t Giterns-dono’s
fault.  
Personally, Giterns-dono was the reason I came. If it were someone else,
things would have turned out differently. They’d probably still be
complaining like Dukaran’s older brother.”

Bege drank his wine a little sheepishly.

“It doesn’t matter what we think of Alberan… a person who changes the
minds of people who couldn't care less during a journey must be a
remarkable person. At least I think Giterns-dono deserves respect.  
We barbarians just lack the insight… if that’s what Giterns-dono thinks…
that’s fine too…”

“That’s not true…”

Argosh hurriedly denied it.  
Bege chuckled, sounding manly.

“I like that about Giterns-dono, but you should have more confidence.  
You’re where you are today because of you… no one else could have done
this. At least, that’s what I think.”

“…Thank you.”

“Besides, the warrior chief and Lila-sama are worried, but Dukaran’s
older brother is just stubborn.  
Once he starts talking to Argosh Giterns-dono instead of that arrogant
noble from Alberan, the problem will be solved easily…  
Beauty is something even the holy spirit can't grasp.”

“He’s not a bad person,” said Bege, pouring himself more wine.  
Vinthril, looking exasperated, offered his own cup to be refilled.

“…You talk too easily.”

“Giterns-dono isn't the kind of person to worry about such things.  
He’s more worried about others worrying about him, isn't he? Isn't that
right?”

Argosh smiled ambiguously.  
Vinthril chuckled wryly.

“I… knew that Giterns-dono was that kind of person.”

“Yes, yes. I'm very grateful for your feelings.”

“…No, I apologize.  
I understand it’s difficult considering your position.”

Vinthril looked at his goblet, deep in thought.

“Just like Bege said, he’s not a bad man. He’s strict with himself and
others, respected by many as a warrior among warriors. He's one of the
people I respect… but because of things in the past, he’s a little too
harsh, I’d say.”

“Things from the past…?”

“Yes. It's a lame excuse, but…”

A month and a half had passed since Argosh arrived in Kreisharana. The
water yams had taken root in the fields, their vines spreading around
them.  
They grew remarkably fast, probably due to the atmosphere and the dragon
magic permeating it.

Thanks to Vinthril, Lila, and Bege, Argosh and his companions were
gradually being accepted.  
People greeted them when they met and would even talk to them.  
Argosh had opportunities to speak about the kingdom in front of several
people, but people were hesitant to openly express their longing for the
plains.  
The responses weren’t very good, so he mainly talked about stories from
Alberan.

Stories like The Maiden of Liberis, old tales, were easily accepted by
the people of Kreisharana.  
Even though hundreds of years separated them, both the kingdom and
Kreisharana respected warriors, and since they were both human, they had
something in common. Argosh recalled the face of the daughter who
repeatedly asked for more stories, her eyes sparkling at the unfamiliar
tales.  
Though Argosh's storytelling wasn't great, he was glad for the attentive
audience who responded to his stories.

Not everyone accepts me.  
Sometimes mischievous children threw mud balls at me, and there were
those, regardless of age or gender, who didn't like the people of the
lowlands.  
The village of Dukaran—not that large—sometimes crossed my path, but I
was mostly ignored.  
However, I occasionally felt gazes from afar, suggesting they weren't
entirely uninterested.

Whether it's aversion or any other emotion, if they direct some feeling
towards me, it might eventually turn into goodwill. It means I'm
recognized as a human being.  
When I was younger and traveled around, many people saw Argosh as a
nobleman, creating a wall between noble and commoner, keeping their
distance.

As one nobleman among many—while perceived that way, everyone responded
formally, never revealing their true feelings.  
But as that perception shifted from the role of nobleman to Argosh the
person, they gradually opened up to me.  
If they are directing some emotion towards Argosh the individual, not
just a lowland nobleman, that’s not a bad thing.

I didn't think I needed to do anything immediately. Gradually, that
interest would hopefully lead to an interest in me personally, and
whether it's aversion or dissatisfaction, they would hopefully engage in
conversation and interaction. Until then, I would patiently wait with an
open heart, simply fulfilling my duties as usual. Openly and without
fear, as a nobleman should be.

I wake up in the morning, swing my sword, have breakfast, and tend the
fields. I visit various parts of the village, learn and record the
culture and customs of Kreisharana, finding similarities and
differences. Then, occasionally gathering people, I tell them stories
and customs of Alberan, and have dinner.  
At night, I share drinks or herbal tea with anyone who visits my tent,
sleep, and wake up again to swing my sword—Argosh swings his sword every
morning.

It started as effort, and now it's habit.

Since I could wield a sword, I’ve honed my skills daily, surpassing
many. I was the one who first taught my younger brother how to use a
sword. Whether or not he goes to war, a nobleman must not neglect sword
training, as he may need to be a shield for the weak. I pompously
repeated the words of the Zain swordsmanship instructor, who
occasionally invited me, teaching my brother how to hold and swing a
sword, and instilling the right mindset.

It wasn't just the sword.  
I taught my brother, who looked up to me with respectful eyes, aspects
of what it meant to be a nobleman that I myself didn't fully understand,
boasting about my advantage of being the elder brother.

Because a nobleman stands above the people, they must be worthy of that
position. They must hone their minds and bodies through greater training
than the people, serve the king rather than their desires, and dedicate
themselves wholeheartedly to the responsibility of extending the great
king's protection to all the weak.  
It's the beauty of that existence that allows us to call ourselves
noblemen—words from my father, other noblemen, and those I respected,
which I repeated as if they were my own.

My brother listened to my description of the ideal nobleman every day,
repeating it and striving tirelessly to approach that ideal—when did I
become afraid of him?  
At some point, I stopped swinging my sword to become the ideal nobleman,
instead, I swung it so I wouldn’t lose to my brother.  
Every moment spent studying, everything, was to avoid being scorned or
underestimated by my brother.

After I realized I couldn't beat him, I pretended to be an understanding
brother.  
I lavishly praised my brother, laughing at his accomplishments, making
it appear as if I possessed greater capacity.  
I certainly loved him.  
But every time we met, a deep inferiority complex welled up inside me.  
When I saw him, something seemed to grip my heart.

I was scared of my brother's admiring gaze. When I was told he would
become the head of the family, I was afraid that his gaze would one day
turn to disappointment.  
I wondered what he would think of a weaker brother becoming the head of
the family, while he supported him. When he declared his intention to
become a soldier—I felt a sense of relief. I thought if he were far
away, this feeling might ease.

—I realized this only after losing him. It was as if I had lost even the
signposts that were clearly visible before. At some point, I realized I
was swinging my sword just to not lose to my brother, and I was lost. I
had forgotten why I swung my sword.

I remembered my brother’s face, saying that I was a model nobleman, that
he respected me, and I remembered all the pompous things I had said, and
I felt ashamed of myself. Since then, I have never stopped. I swung my
sword to become the nobleman I had spoken to him about.

It wasn't for superiority or to show off, nor to protect some petty
pride. It didn’t matter whether I would ever swing it again in the
future.  
As a nobleman, I must not neglect sword training, as I may need to be a
shield for the weak. I swung the sword to not betray the words I had
told him.  
To be able to confidently give the same answer to the brother who died
believing those words, I swung the sword. To be able to answer him as an
elder brother, that he had served the people and fulfilled the duties of
a nobleman, I swung the sword.

In the past, it was an effort. To rise above, not to lose, not to be
underestimated.  
I swung the sword as if to escape something.

After realizing it, it became a habit. Like waking up to the cold water,
or stretching lightly as soon as you wake up. I swung the sword to be
the nobleman my brother loved.

It wasn't a competition, a comparison, or to strive for greatness.
Swinging a sword befits a nobleman's morning. Because I thought so, I
naturally picked up my sword in the morning.

"Good morning."

"Ah, good morning."

In the lowlands, the sun rises just before dawn—that’s when Argosh wakes
up.  
In this mountainous region, the rising sun is obscured by mountains, the
sky is still close to night, and they appear from their tents only after
the sun illuminates half the sky. With slightly sleepy faces, they pick
up their swords and line up.

I hadn’t established any specific rules. Except for breakfast duty, they
have free time until breakfast. It’s a stressful environment—I told them
to relax, but unknowingly, they too started to attend the morning
training. At first, they each practiced casually; as the number of
people increased, they began to ask for my instructions, and it became
like training.

"From a cross-slash to a horizontal slash, from a cross-slash to an
upward slash, twenty each to the left and right, thirty thrusts with a
step-in, thirty thrusts with the reverse grip. Then, as usual, we move
on to spears."

"Yes."

"Take it slow for the first ten repetitions, carefully checking your
movements. Let's begin."

I clap my hands, and each of them begins swinging their swords. The
important thing is to make it instinctive. The more you try to swing
fast, the more you focus on your arms. With centrifugal force, you can
swing the sword with your arms alone, but you can’t swing it slowly with
just your arms.  
Unless you use your whole body, you can’t create a beautiful sword
flash, and you can’t convey the weight of the sword. Whether or not they
possess magic, the basic body movements are the same.

Without giving any particular orders, each person quietly practices.
Half of them couldn’t handle magic, and even among those who could,
there are differences in sword proficiency, skill, and magic handling.
While it looks better to have them swing their swords in unison, this
method makes the differences between them clearer.

"Trollus, you're tensing your shoulders. The key is your torso."

"Yes."

I swing my sword to demonstrate.  
The cross-slash to horizontal slash, the upward slash to thrust,
repeated tens of thousands of times. A natural flow of movement, free of
wasted motion, performed slowly.

"The rope that extends from your spine—that's your arm.  
Swing the sword tied to the end of that rope with your body movements.  
Keep that in mind and relax your shoulders.  
Tensing your arms hinders the transmission of power to the sword.”

"…Thank you."

"The arm's role is to guide the power transmitted from your legs and
torso. …Think of it like the reins of a horse."

"Reins…"

"You may be the one guiding it, but the horse is the one running. No
matter how much force you put on the reins to make it turn right or
left, it's meaningless. You can't overcome a resistant horse with just
brute strength. The important thing is to guide the horse smoothly to
the intended destination… The horse is your legs and torso strength.
You're so skilled at horsemanship, you should understand that."

I laugh, pat Trollus on the shoulder, and then move on to the others.
Teaching others enhances my own training.  
Vague understanding deepens when I translate it into words that I can
convey to others.  
I see many things I couldn't see back when I was swinging my sword just
to beat my brother.

I’m sure my brother never lost sight of it from childhood.  
I think he swung his sword as a nobleman, not recklessly.  
All those unbelievable efforts were merely habits to him. He must have
truly believed that it was what a nobleman should do, and I am utterly
ashamed of my own fear.

My brother never swung his sword for comparison. That is why he looked
up to me, his elder brother Argosh, with respect.

"…?"

Just as the training shifted from swords to spears, a commotion arose
from the village.  
I tilted my head, and then saw griffons taking flight.

I listened closely, and heard a distant bell.  
And in the west—smoke rose into the sky, like a column or something.

"…What happened?"

"It seems something did. Cax, training is suspended; stop cooking
breakfast for now.  
And everyone, prepare your equipment so that you can equip it at any
time."

"Yes!  
Understood.  
Breakfast will be fruit for now."

Some village must have been attacked—anyway, it doesn’t call for
immediate action, but in a place like this…we’d better be more vigilant
than usual.

Just in case, I put on the simple gauntlets and breastplate I had
brought. A griffin appeared from the sky, and Bege, with a serious
expression, was riding it.

"Word came that a Stormwing flew west."

"Stormwing…"

It was a giant eagle beast.  
As its name suggests, it's a monstrous bird that can unleash storms with
a single flap of its wings. It is the most feared beast in this land.  
Even griffons avoid it, and its raging winds render even javelins
ineffective. It cuts down forests and devours even other beasts—a
monster among monsters.

"It’s an insurmountable monster. I hope it won’t come this close to the
Holy Spirits; but in any case, the whole mountain will be in turmoil for
a while. For now, let’s bring Giterns-dono here; the tribal chiefs will
hold a meeting."

"Understood. Cax, I leave the rest to you."

"Ha!"

As I spoke, I felt a chill run down my spine. The Stormwing itself is a
terrifying creature. Even other beasts turn their backs on the
Stormwing.  
The beasts will wreak havoc on other territories as they flee, and that
will spread chain-reaction throughout the mountains—and among those
affected will naturally be the territory where these mountain dwellers
live.

Meanwhile, at that time—

"How is it? Today's dessert?"

"Hmm, it's quite good…"

"Fufu, thank you."

Kreschenta, in her nightclothes, sat on Berry's lap, arms crossed, her
back resting against her ample bosom, only her mouth moving. The knives
and forks were fully automatic—because Kreschenta had just woken up.

"You're really unkempt in the mornings. Even if your work is from noon,
you should at least change clothes, shouldn't you?"

"Well, you were quite busy yesterday… You must be tired."

"I'm tired…"

"You use that to spoil yourself…"

She sleepily blinked, stifling a yawn. Anne and Elvena giggled,
shoulders shaking, and Krische moved her chair closer, looking envious.

"Um, Berry, Krische too, that…"

"Krische, you even indulge like that, so she's like this.  
Do you understand?"

"Eh…?"

"Fufu, you mustn't tease Krische-sama. Krische-sama, here you go."

"Hehe, ahhh…"

"You…"

Unaware of the distant problems, the mansion remained peaceful as ever.
