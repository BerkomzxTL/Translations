# Chapter 355 - The Mad Rabbit's Twirl-Slash Top

“You see, you circle around like this, \*kurukuru\*, then you swiftly
strike, \*shutto\*.  
It’s \*kurukuru shutto\*.”

“….Y-yes.  
\*Kurukuru\*… then \*shutto\*?”

This took place in the year 29 of the Unified Calendar, in the Royal
Capital, at the Black Flag Swordsmanship Dojo.

The reason why Boji, a student, was listening to this incomprehensible
explanation goes back a week.

The Black Flag Swordsmanship Dojo was built in the Royal Capital fifteen
years ago.  
Boji, a boy at the time, was the first to decide to join.  
His reasons were that it was a dojo founded by the heroes of the
commoners—former members of the Black Flag Special Forces whom Boji
admired—and that it was located near his home.

While many learned the reality of harsh training and quit, Boji attended
almost every day for fifteen years, honing his skills and eventually
becoming an assistant instructor, guiding younger students.  
He now possessed swordsmanship that could easily defeat ordinary
soldiers, his skill even surpassing some of the unit members. He
continued his relentless training because he knew there were always
those stronger than him.

He had inherent talent and had mastered the use of what was called
magic.  
Because of this, he understood the immense heights he still had to
reach.  
He was still inferior to the highly skilled instructors, such as Kahlua,
the head instructor known as the Black Cat of Alberinea, who was like a
cloud in the distant sky.  
And the Black Flag Swordsmanship Dojo, while still immature as a kendo
dojo, also focused on practical combat techniques, offering a vast
amount of knowledge.  
His time spent there was central to Boji's life.

However, Boji had a recent worry. It concerned Saranis, his lover, a
customer who visited his family's bakery every morning.  
Six months ago he asked her on a date, confessed his feelings, and
recently proposed marriage. She tearfully accepted, but then came the
problem.

Saranis was the daughter of a noble family.  
Her grandfather, who raised her after she lost her parents at a young
age, was a strict old man who had trained in the military from the age
of fifteen.  
After hearing various stories from Saranis, Boji was challenged to a
sword fight and was repeatedly defeated three times before being sent
away, as the discussion became impossible. The grandfather was a Major
General in the military; he had once been stripped of his title due to a
subordinate's misconduct, demoted to a Centurion, and then regained his
rank through meritorious service. He was a true warrior, whose skills
had been honed on the battlefield. Boji was powerless against his sword.

Naturally, he consulted the instructors.  
That night, at the dojo, they listened to his story with laughter,
encouraging the dejected Boji.

"Hmm, but Major General Baurlzon… I think I've heard that name before."

"Major General Baurlzon?"

Then, Mia, the director, appeared.  
Along with Kahlua, the head instructor, she was a youthful
chestnut-haired woman who didn't look her age.  
She was the head of the Black Flag Special Forces and the director of
the dojo – the top person in charge – yet she was treated rather
casually by the members.  
She was always busy and constantly had tasks piled on her. Though over
seventy, she appeared young and had a charming aura, lacking any real
sense of authority.

"Oh, Mia, are you finished with work?"

"….Finished for today. I'm stuck with paperwork while Kahlua and the
others have all the fun."

"That's not finished, that's slacking—"

"Shut up. ….What about this person?"

Kahlua and the others summarized Boji’s story for Mia, who looked
troubled.  
She frowned, her eyes showing pity as she looked at Boji, then at
Kahlua.

"....If I recall correctly, Major General Baurlzon is the person that
Krische-sama punished."

"Usa-chan… ah, the person who mass-produced limb-severings with the
Jarea-Gashea."

"Probably. I think the Major General at that time was named Baurlzon,
and he was pardoned for his later achievements or something."

"Limb-severing… is that right?"

"Yes, yes, a Centurion unit attacked a village and did terrible things,
so as a warning, Usa-chan dismembered every single one of the hundred
men on the spot.  
It was during the Elsren Dismemberment War."

The word "rabbit" brought to mind a girl who frequently appeared in an
apron dress.  
A silver-haired, fairy-like beauty. She always brought homemade cookies,
making her popular with the children as the "cookie onee-san" rather
than Alberinea.  
Boji, too, once felt that way, as the title of "Alberinea," the name
synonymous with the legendary "Heavenly Sword,"  
and the kingdom's unparalleled master swordsman had long been considered
separate personas. Now, he had no doubts about her true identity, but
these stories still caused some confusion due to the gap between her
legend and her actual personality.

"Officially, it was a war to liberate the people from the oppressive
Elsren, so she was even more merciless. Well, Usa-chan never really
understood the word mercy… It was a horrible sight.  
In front of 20,000 people, she used the Jarea-Gashea to cut off the arms
and legs of each person in an assembly line fashion, saying, 'Okay, next
person.'"

"….Indeed, that's a sight one can't forget."

Zarka, a tough-looking instructor with a scarred left eye, nodded, and
the other men agreed.

"Really, Usa-chan's a bit… mentally unwell. Even when she smiled and
said, 'Going smoothly,' I didn't know what to reply."

"I don't want to remember that."

Mia sighed.  
Boji shuddered as he imagined the young, lovely princess smiling while
watching the limb-severings, and this image, strangely, felt perfectly
accurate.  
In ordinary interaction, she seemed as kind and gentle as her appearance
suggested, unusually humble and approachable for her position.  
She was probably that way; sincere and kind to everyone. But after
having once received her instruction, he had understood that the "Cruel
Alberinea" of the legends was also true.

She described, for example, a foot stomping technique: lightly stepping
on the knee to easily break it; explaining that areas lacking bones were
easy to cut, that when stabbing the chest, it was better to have the
opponent lying down because of the ribs, and that the neck could be
easily crushed with bare hands, and that even with a helmet, the brain
could be easily reached from under the chin, and so on.  
She presented this practical human-destruction course with a smile, and
the image was not unlike a child casually tearing the limbs off an
insect.

"Anyway… Major General Baurlzon was almost executed as a warning, so
maybe he harbored resentment towards Krische-sama. Since this is the
Black Flag Special Forces dojo, he might even have it in for us…"

"E-executed…?"

"Yes, the responsibility of Major General Baurlzon, who failed to
control his subordinates, was heavy. …But, he seemed to be greatly
loved, and several other Centurions and Major Generals pleaded on his
behalf, and as a result, he was stripped of his title and demoted.  
The problematic Centurion unit was newly formed, and their Centurion had
just died in battle, and the new Centurion had just been appointed. "

Mia muttered, recalling the events, crossing her arms.

"....Krische-sama probably wanted to severely punish him because it was
early in the war…but for the one targeted, it would be hard to accept."

Indeed, the situation seemed bad.  
Boji's face turned pale, and Mia frantically shook her head.

"W-well, it's just speculation, it's possible we're overthinking things,
she might not have any such intentions."

"Y-yes… I hope so…"

"Hmm, well, Usa-chan's policies were fairly consistent, and if he was so
beloved, he probably wouldn't hold a grudge… However, whether Usa-chan
herself felt that way or not, the story of how her hometown was attacked
by bandits ands he lost her foster parents is quite famous."

"….Is that so?"

Kahlua nodded.

"She's always been incredibly strict about violence against civilians,
always resulting in immediate execution.  
I think some of that stems from things that happened in her past.…"

"I see…"

"Well, I don't know if that's right, but for those not involved, that’s
a pretty easy reason to accept. ….Of course, the person who almost got
executed would be furious, but considering the timing, the heavy
punishment did have some justification."

"….Hearing all this, being a soldier seems really tough."

A Major General commands a thousand men.  
A thousand. Not ten or twenty. There are bound to be troublemakers and
hopeless individuals.  
With a newly formed unit, there wouldn't have been time to fully assess
them, and even more so if the Centurion was newly promoted.  
If that person was bad, it was a tragedy, and being told to die for that
was incredibly unjust.

"Well, the battlefield is fundamentally unjust. Winning the war is the
top priority, lives are cheap, and if a superior officer tells a soldier
to die, they die; and if a soldier makes a mistake, the superior officer
is told to die along with them."

Kahlua said nonchalantly.

"We had it easier under Usa-chan, but everyone is always under the
stress of possibly dying tomorrow, so everyone gets reckless, and that's
why such strict measures are needed to keep things in order."

Boji understood what she meant.  
The military was an organization based on violence—some joined
willingly, but many joined due to poverty or unemployment, and some were
bandits.  
In the worst case, many soldiers were low-quality expendable items,
tools used until they broke.  
Rather than preaching morality to people who might die tomorrow,
instilling fear was much more efficient and less troublesome.  
The military organization sacrificed many things people valued to win.

"The fact that there weren't many civilian casualties during that
invasion is partly because Usa-chan punished those who were involved so
harshly… 'Kill ten to save a hundred' is a legitimate military strategy.
Someone who worked their way up to Major General would surely understand
such a harsh logic."

Asked about what kind of person he was, Boji thought for a moment.

"I haven't spoken to him for long, but… from my girlfriend Saranis, I
hear that he's very serious and doesn't tolerate dishonesty. The
impression I got was the same."

"Then maybe you're overthinking things… maybe Boji simply wasn't good
enough for his granddaughter.  
The requirements seem rather high… Shericia, what do you think?  
As someone who would also be judging."

"U-uh…"

Shericia, who had been listening intently, blushed and avoided eye
contact.  
She was a rising star at the Black Flag Swordsmanship Dojo, quickly
rising to the rank of assistant instructor.  
This genius swordsman, with a lovely appearance but capable of handling
a sharp sword freely, stuttered with a reaction appropriate for her age.

"I-I… that is, it’s not like that…"

"She said she only cares about men stronger than her, so it's pretty
much the same."

"Listen… you know who's to blame.  
Kahlua egged them on for fun, so they both couldn't back down.  
Kyuris is a bit foolish too…"

Mia said, exasperated.  
Apparently, Shericia had a half-official relationship with a young man
named Kyuris, with their families approving, but their relationship
wasn't progressing. However, to Boji, it was an endearing worry, as it
was clear to everyone that they were in love, with both parents being
supportive.

"Shericia should have Mia's level of foolishness or something.  
Do you know? When Mia confessed to me…  
W-what!?"

"....Kahlua, if you tell that story, I’ll seriously get angry."

"W-wait, my hair… I think you're already angry."

"Shut up."

Mia grabbed Kahlua's long hair, Kahlua glared resentfully at Mia, and
everyone except the blushing Shericia burst into laughter. Mia let go,
sighed, and looked at Boji.

"Anyway… if he's like that, it's unavoidable, and you'll just have to
keep challenging him until he accepts you. Even if you can't win, he
might approve if he sees your growth and says, 'Alright, if you're that
determined, I'll entrust my daughter to you.' "

"Yes… Is that the most direct approach?"

"Indeed… Well, I can understand the feeling of wanting to say, 'I won't
let you have my daughter!' If you're serious, you'll eventually get his
approval. If I had a daughter instead of a son, that’s exactly what I’d
say."

"It would be nice to be as straightforward as Zarka. …Either way, it's
all about training.  
It can't be helped, I'll lend a hand."

Kahlua stood up and went to the wall, tossing a wooden sword to Boji and
said with a smile.

"Come at me from anywhere you like.  
Onee-san will personally give you gentle instruction on swordsmanship."

"Thank you…"

"Kahlua, how long are you going to act like an onee-san?"

"Mia is a fool.  
Beauties are always onee-sans."

Everyone at the Black Flag Swordsmanship Dojo was kind and easygoing.  
They were the heroes of the kingdom, worthy of song, but they were
completely unpretentious, kind and helpful, often spending their free
time helping Boji train.

However, swords aren't something you master overnight. Boji had been
having trouble progressing, and one girl was called in to help him.

“You see, you circle around like this, \*kurukuru\*, then you swiftly
strike, \*shutto\*.  
It’s \*kurukuru shutto\*.”

“….Y-yes.  
\*Kurukuru\*… then \*shutto\*?”

It was Krische-Alberinea-Christand, the great hero whose name was known
by all. Instead of her usual apron dress, she was wearing a white dress
with black lines.  
She truly looked like a princess—a noble figure between high society and
fantasy.

However, this royal sister Alberinea possessed incredibly nimble
footwork.

Kahlua had asked her, and she readily agreed to teach Boji
swordsmanship. It seemed strange that she would appear at the dojo
bearing a basket of cookies, but it was quite intimidating to have a
royal princess make a special appearance for a commoner like Boji. Boji
used to think of her as just the "cookie onee-san," but as an adult, he
was more aware of things like social standing and decorum. However,
Alberinea remained unchanged.

The children, who only knew her as the "cookie onee-san," were stunned
by Alberinea's swordsmanship. Even children could tell at a glance.  
With a wooden sword, her movements were like a graceful dance.  
Soft, smooth, seamless, and yet freezingly sharp, without a single
wasted motion. A seemingly evaded attack would suddenly appear at the
next spot, resting right next to her neck.  
Facing her, one wouldn't even be able to comprehend what was happening.

Alberinea was truly a wielder of the Heavenly Sword.

What she was teaching was a circling movement.  
She would swing her sword from the right, and while maintaining
momentum, move past the opponent’s right side to their back, then
swiftly turn around.  
The moment she circled, she moved into an attacking position, and
instantly dealt a final blow from behind.

To get past the opponent’s side, she kept her stance low, but the key
was her unique footwork.  
Her light steps controlled the momentum, making her movements look like
a dance rather than a fight.

“Hmm, it feels like \*ton, tat, donn\*.”

“T… \*ton, tat, don\*?”

“No. The last part isn’t \*don\*, it’s \*donn\*.  
\*Donn\* is the \*donn\* of the stepping in.”

"—I don't understand at all."

I desperately try to suppress the feeling of giving up welling up
inside.  
Seeing Boji like this, Kahlua offers a helping hand.

"Ah, basically, when you try to slip past someone's side with a
rightward horizontal slash, you almost fall over from the momentum,
right?"

"Y-yes..."

"In that state, where you're about to fall while sideways, you kick the
ground again to forcibly readjust your posture..."

Then she slowly demonstrated it in front of me.  
First, the step forward and the rightward slash.  
If you let yourself go with the momentum, your body naturally rotates
counter-clockwise while moving forward.  
Normally, you would counteract that inertia the moment you withdraw your
sword, eliminating any opening. But this sword utilizes that inertia.

Just before falling, Kahlua lightly kicked the floor with her right
foot, accelerating the rotation while inverting behind him—firmly
absorbing the forward momentum with both feet and crouching.

With her behind Boji, she was already in a perfect stance for a strike.

"If you stop the forward momentum with both feet, your landing posture
becomes your strike stance.  
Then, if you jump, you can land a blow on an opponent trying to turn
towards you.  
Basically, including the initial step, you kick the ground three
times... Minimizing movements to complete an attack, a circling
maneuver, and the next attack. That's the Usagi-ryu (Rabbit style)
swordsmanship, the secret technique 'Kurukuru Shutt'!"

"I see..."

"If you master this, I'll make you the third Usagi-ryu swordsmanship
master, my successor, and the grandmaster of this place."

"Is...is it really that difficult...?"

Chuckling, Kahlua patted Boji on the shoulder.

"Well, only top-tier swordsmen like me can use it unconsciously...But,
if you just focus on the execution, you might be able to do it with
practice.  
Shericia can do it, right?"

"Huh?  
Ah...I wouldn't say I can..."

Shericia, who had been watching from beside Kurisu, stood up and
apologetically held her wooden sword in front of Boji.

Then, lowering her stance, a sharp rightward slash. Boji instinctively
dodged, and as he tried to turn around, Shericia, already in a striking
stance behind him, launched a thrust—Boji, stumbling, reflexively raised
his wooden sword to block. Shericia lost her balance, there was no
follow-up attack, and she said apologetically,

"It's still...a work in progress..."

"Shericia's 'ton-ton-don' is good. It's 'ton-ta-don'.  
The 'ta' is too heavy and slow, which is why it could be blocked."

"Yes, I'll practice more..."

Nodding to Shericia, who bowed her head, I understood. Shericia was
gifted with swordsmanship talent. I would be surpassed eventually, but
she's not even 20 yet, and currently, Boji is superior.

But the chill Boji felt just now...If it had been even a moment faster,
it couldn't have been blocked. It's a deadly magic sword, once you've
dodged the rightward slash with bodywork.

"Generally, losing your balance is bad, but intentionally destabilizing
yourself within your control is fine.  
Right on the verge of falling..."

Once again, Krische stood before Boji.  
It wasn't an incredibly fast sword, yet, before Boji knew it, a
horizontal slash was right in front of him.  
He had no choice but to kick the ground to dodge—

"And spin around and swiftly strike the neck."

Before he could even land, he already felt the wooden sword on the back
of his neck. Even knowing it was coming, Boji couldn't react.

"You just need to make a half-inch cut on the side of the neck.  
After that, it's super easy. It's from behind...it doesn't have to be a
thrust; anything will do, but since Krische values her sword, she
recommends the neck.  
The armpit is also good; it makes blood flow."

"Y-yes..."

Despite being a wooden sword, the pressure was terrifying.  
Normally, he would be dead before he could even utter a gasp. Even the
chill came a beat late, and when the wooden sword left Boji’s neck, he
let out a sigh of relief.

She had been on the battlefield long ago—around the time Boji was
born.  
It was a world he only knew through imagination, but seeing her sword
made it clear why the warriors of that time all feared her.

A deadly footwork technique with a ridiculous name. But it's not a
secret technique of a school of swordsmanship like Zain's. This is
merely a small fragment of her swordsmanship.

Perhaps what he was seeing was the ultimate sword everyone sought.  
Changing his mindset, Boji prepared himself again to copy the footwork.

—The rematch was a month later.
