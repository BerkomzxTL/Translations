# Chapter 318 - Responsibility 4

The only entrance to the village, which continues from Arna, is located
to the northeast.  
To the southeast flows a stream, where fields are located, and the women
often work by the stream during the day.  
Warrior training takes place in the north and northwest, which is toward
the Sacred Spirit's restricted area.  
Slightly further south and west are the craftsmen's quarters, and near
them are the Argosh tents and fields.

Dwellings are relatively concentrated in the center, but the distance
between each house is greater than in a typical village.  
Apparently, this is mainly to ensure visibility in case of a monster
attack; the fence surrounding the village is simple and ineffective
against monsters.  
Instead, there are significantly more watchtowers than in an ordinary
village.  
Located in the center of the village is an exceptionally sturdy
warehouse.  
This serves as a refuge in times of emergency, and next to it, alongside
the chieftain's house, is a large assembly hall.

The meetings held there resemble military strategy sessions.  
The tense, heavy atmosphere is very similar.  
If war breaks out with Elderant, the area managed by the Giterns family
will become one of the northern army's supply bases.  
The same was true during the recent Great War—most of those present were
Arna's soldiers, but their bearing is unmistakably that of warriors.

They readily sacrifice their lives for their goals. At least,
experienced soldiers are like that.  
Their world is completely different from those who live daily lives like
the Argoshes.  
Even if they possessed the strength of Dukaran, it wouldn't matter.  
Their words and actions carry an unspoken weight, an unquantifiable
pressure stemming from the determination dwelling within them.

If they can achieve their objective, they don't mind sacrificing
hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of lives for their own.  
The atmosphere exuded by those who bear such a heavy responsibility so
naturally. No amount of training or swordsmanship can compare to that.  
The reason Argosh didn't show fear upon entering the room with Bege was
due to his long life and cunning.

I recall the face of the girl who was given the rank of marshal at the
young age of fifteen.  
In the civil war, she succeeded her father and led the Christand army,
defeating the king's brother, Gildanstein—Selene Christand.

She's not, at least, a possessor of supernatural abilities like the
Queen or Alberinea.  
Despite this, she holds the marshal's position, commanding the entire
kingdom's army, simply through sheer determination, appearing dignified
and smiling. Although I only exchanged greetings with her a few times
during my recent stay, knowing that such a person exists in the world
makes one reflect on their own life.

I feel a cold sweat on my back, but I walk and sit with dignity as a
nobleman of the kingdom.  
Argosh is far too ordinary compared to those people.  
But in this place, Argosh is the representative of all the nobles in the
kingdom, and he cannot afford to show any behavior that would bring
shame upon them.  
Argosh's every word and action must not tarnish the reputation of the
noble figures deserving of respect from all.

I silently adjust my breathing, straighten my posture, and bow slightly
to the Alkyrens seated in front.

On a slightly raised platform.  
Seated in front are Alkyrens, Vinthril, and Lila.  
A slender old man is also seated in a comfortable chair; presumably,
that's the previous chieftain, Elder Beecils.  
I hear he has been quite ill for several years, but his gaze at Argosh
is still as sharp as a warrior's, and he was talking to Alkyrens about
something.

Argosh is seated to the left, a little distance from the line of
warriors.  
This must be the guest's seat.  
There seems to be a certain order in the line, and the men who were with
me the other day are mostly in the front—the further forward one sits,
the more obvious their aura of dominance.

"...It seems that enough have gathered."

After a while, Alkyrens speaks gravely.

"I believe you've already heard, but a Stormwing took flight in the
west. The reason we've gathered you all here is to discuss our response.
In the worst-case scenario—considering the possibility of it flying
here—we want to exchange opinions here. ...Elder."

Bald with a long white beard reaching his chest.  
Beecils sits up slightly and speaks.

"...As you may have heard, only those like myself and Alkyrens have seen
a Stormwing.  
First, without exaggeration, we must let you all know what kind of
monster it is."

His raspy voice reverberates through the assembly hall.  
And Beecils begins to speak.

Stormwing—a giant eagle monster.  
Even without spreading its wings, it possesses a physique comparable to
a Ranka, and its wings can create winds strong enough to destroy a hut
with a single flap.  
Its winds lift not only trees but even Suikos into the air, easily
carrying even a Ranka-sized body.  
Even Griffins, who control the skies, cannot resist this wind, and it
has claimed many Lion-Griffin knights.

The last time was about sixty years ago.  
A Stormwing only flies for a few days, or at most a few weeks. The
reason they can live here despite this monstrous creature is due to its
short active period.  
It usually rests quietly on the peaks of the harsh mountains. The
reasons for this are unknown, as is why the Stormwing, which can go
without hunting for so many years, chooses to hunt at certain times.  
However, it is a monstrous creature akin to a natural disaster which,
once it takes to the skies, brings great calamity.

In the history of Kreisharana, the Stormwing has only been slain once.  
Three hundred Lion-Griffin knights attacked it, and two-thirds of them
were lost.  
Since then, including sixty years ago, they have repelled the Stormwing
three times, but suffered significant losses each time.  
Sixty years ago, about forty out of one hundred and twenty Lion-Griffin
knights were lost.

In Kreisharana, both Griffins and their riders are extremely valuable.  
Considering that the current total number throughout Kreisharana is
about one hundred and fifty knights, it was almost a total war.  
They avoid being caught overhead and fly above the Stormwing, hitting it
with javelins in the swirling winds, or resorting to desperate suicide
attacks.  
Hoping that the threatened Stormwing will flee.

"Considering the possibility that it might head this way in the worst
case, there's no alternative to using Lion-Griffin knights to counter
it.  
Leaving behind the guardians of the restricted area and a few knights,
the rest will depart for the village of Rosarenu in the west today.
...Vinthril, who will remain?"

Alkyrens asks, and Vinthril looks at Bege.

"Bege, you'll be in charge of the village skies."

"Understood, warrior chief. Can I have Crosseran and Beegs?"

"Yes.  
Velvas, this will put a burden on the guards, but..."

The man who arrived last—it seems they were waiting for him.  
The well-built man called Velvas nods naturally.

"It's fine. Bege, I'll also put Kepis in the village. If we need to
increase the patrol area... I'd like to bring the Griffin's food before
you leave."

"I'll arrange that later, I'll leave the village to you."

"Warrior chief, please be careful. I don't want to see my lovely
daughter lose her husband so soon after getting married. I might end up
kicking over your grave marker."

"Haha, I don't want my grave marker to be kicked over by my
father-in-law."

The two laugh, and those around them chuckle.  
Argosh is probably the only one who isn't amused.  
They were laughing with the possibility of death in mind.

I imagine the grave markers, spears driven into the earth, lined up at
the edge of the village.  
In Kreisharana, where the main threat is monsters, the bodies of the
dead are not left behind.  
In such cases, spears are planted as grave markers, left until they
rot.  
There were many new ones there.

This is such a harsh environment.  
Like the soldiers on a battlefield, they accept their own deaths as a
daily reality.

"Dukaran, you'll be in command of the entire village.  
Coordinate with Bege."

"Leave it to me."

Dukaran nods heavily, and seeing this, Vinthril turns to Argosh.

"Giterns-dono. Things will get hectic from now on.  
Today is likely the last day you'll be able to safely descend the
mountain..."

"Don't worry about us.  
We'll do whatever we can to help."

The eyes of those around us turn to us, and of course, Dukaran's too.  
He glares at Argosh.

"You're a hindrance."

"Including myself, there are eleven of us. We can't say we can directly
confront monsters, but we can at least serve as lookouts.  
Considering the possibility that vigilance might be prolonged, more eyes
are better.  
It will also somewhat reduce the burden on Dukaran and his team."

I say this without averting my gaze.

"...I swear on the Queen and my name that I will definitely be of
service."

Dukaran starts to say something, and Vinthril stops him.

"Dukaran. Giterns-dono' words are correct. Since we can't rely on the
knights, more eyes are better.  
If you can't put your personal feelings aside, I'll have someone else
take command."

"...Yes."

"...I'm sorry, Giterns-dono. I'm sorry to rely on a guest..."

"No. The rift between the kingdom and Kreisharana has been healed, and
Her Majesty has declared that she welcomes us as allies. ...Therefore,
it is our duty to dedicate our swords and lives to this dire situation.
Let us help."

Vinthril smiles and nods.

"At least, as warrior chief, I can vouch for Giterns-dono' character as
a warrior and his sufficient abilities. Dukaran, understood?"

"Yes, warrior chief."

"Take a look at one of the watchtowers.  
The placement is up to you."

――Dukaran's adherence to the traditional form of Kreisharana stems from
the past.  
Dukaran's younger brother, who was a few years younger, possessed
extraordinary talent, even Vinthril, who was the same age, called him
amazing.  
Dukaran, already a renowned warrior at the time, boasted that his
brother would one day surpass him, and paid special attention to him.

Vinthril also saw his brother as a rival, honing their skills with
spears, and then the squire's trials at the age of fifteen.  
His brother, who was expected to return, did not.  
He noticed a Suiko behind another apprentice who had taken the same
trials. He stood in front of the Suiko and died.

Dukaran mourned greatly, but death is commonplace in Kreisharana.  
Despite being able to help, he did not resent the apprentice who
returned without his brother.  
Encounters with monsters are exceptions to the trials.  
The trial is stopped at that point.  
Besides, it's not something an apprentice could win against.  
Dukaran seems to have accepted it as an unfortunate accident.

However, the apprentice then became a squire.  
Hunting like the others, he again encountered a Suiko.  
While blowing the whistle to call the Lion-Griffin knights, he fled
towards the forest where the women were collecting herbs, never letting
the monster get close.  
The Suiko was a monster that could level a Century—the women had no
chance.  
He caused many casualties, including Dukaran's pregnant wife.

Ignoring the pleas of those around him, Dukaran furiously hunted the
Suiko alone and, shedding tears of blood, blamed the village's structure
for everything.  
He believed that the loosening of the traditional ways had produced
cowards unworthy of being called warriors and caused many casualties.

For Argosh, who was born in Alberan, the ideas of Alkyrens and Vinthril
are easy to accept.  
They consider and maintain the future of the village through the
village's structure rather than strict punishment.  
They let go of past grudges and build new relationships.

Alberan, once just one tribe, formed alliances with many opposing tribes
and achieved its current status as a great nation through cooperation.  
Of course, this process naturally involved much bloodshed and problems,
but their culture and customs stemming from such a history are what make
them think so. Argosh sincerely believes that their way of thinking is
commendable.

However, he also understands Dukaran's feelings and his ideas.  
Life in Kreisharana, a harsh land—the exchange with Alberan might one
day lead to their destruction.  
At least, from what Vinthril and Lila had said, it seemed they
envisioned such a future as well.  
Many likely understand, which is why some reject it.

If they moved to a plain, they would be freed from their harsh life, and
the likelihood of dying in a monster attack would drastically
decrease.  
A simple solution, in theory.  
However, people are bound to the past and the dead.

The culture and customs of their ancestors who lived here—the sacrifices
they made.  
These were unavoidable sacrifices.  
They accepted them, adapted, endured much suffering and sorrow, and
lived here.

They cannot abandon that and face those who died defending this harsh
land.  
That's understandable.  
The reason for their aversion to Argosh is also clear.

"I understand his feelings to some degree... but his attitude towards
Giterns-dono is a bit much. I don't ask for a smile, but..."

"It can't be helped.  
It's a fact that even I, compared to the warriors here, am not
sufficiently capable.  
Even if they are told to trust me, they can't."

I say this while overlooking the entire village from the top of the
watchtower.  
One of the watchtowers in the center of the village, which overlooks the
forest rather than just guarding it.  
It was their job to relay the information down.

"And for forest surveillance, experienced people are better.  
Especially at night, there's the possibility of mistaking deer or boars
that come out, and the warriors have better night vision."

"Well, that's true."

"Nonetheless, it is an important role. Don't make mistakes with the
flags and numbers."

"Yes."

There are nine watchtowers around the village. Each is numbered,
starting from the north, which faces the sacred area, and going
clockwise from 1 to 9.  
Apparently, the first thing children learn is the numbers of the
watchtowers.  
In an emergency, signals are given with flags and bells.

In Kreisharana, two people usually climb a watchtower at a time.  
One watchtower consists of three pairs of six people, and shifts are
changed roughly every three hours. The Argoshes are organized into three
teams of three. Argosh and one other would do odd jobs during the day,
and at night they would be four people on watch in the watchtower.

They are often used as guards, but they are originally guards.  
Their usual guard duties are primarily watching and surveillance, so
they weren't worried about that, but that was only against humans.  
They had never performed monster-oriented surveillance before, so they
are taking extra precautions.

'It's the warrior chief's order.  
I'm entrusting this watchtower to you... don't think of anything
strange?'

'Something strange?'

'Even if a monster appears, don't interfere.  
You're a hindrance. Your job is only to keep this watchtower
functioning, nothing more. ...If you interfere, consider yourself dead.
I'll kill you then.'

'...I'll keep it in mind.'

He's harsh, but he's right.  
They had been trained to deal with monsters, but compared to those who
had been mentally and physically trained from childhood, it was
makeshift at best.  
Unnecessary interference would indeed be a hindrance.

From the watchtower to below.  
Looking up at the sky, a Griffin takes off—it must be Bege.  
At night, aerial surveillance is less effective.  
It's already a deep forest.  
There aren't many places where you can see clearly.

Even during the day, they rely on the Griffin's instincts and eyes.  
At night, even that becomes unreliable, which is why they patrol a wide
area during the day. They flew almost non-stop.

Towards the refuge I was worried about.  
Several roofed platforms were built around it, and the craftsmen were
carrying wood.  
The number of bonfires is excessive.

"Priestess."

"What is it?"

I called out to Lila, who was watching, and she turned around and tilted
her head.  
As always, her womanly figure was quite revealing—I still haven't gotten
used to it.

"Isn't that a lot of bonfires...?"

"Guard fires. We put a lot of protective incense into the stacked wood,
a small measure, but it's to ward off beasts... I don't know how
effective it is."

"I see, that's it."

I pondered for a moment and asked.

"Is it true that Suikos have a good sense of smell?"

"Yes. They seem to dislike having their noses paralyzed. Although, it
seems irrelevant when they're faced with prey... Is there something?"

"I just want to do what I can."

Lila smiled softly and happily.

"Thank you, truly. ...But, please don't overdo it if anything happens.
Giterns-dono is essential for the exchange between both countries."

"Yes, I'll be careful. The Kreisharana warriors are wonderful... I trust
them, but nothing is absolute. I want to avoid regretting it if
something happens."

"...Yes."

After thanking her again, I went to my tent.  
I looked at the contents of the wagon I'd come in on. I had brought
quite a few gifts, but only everyday items had been accepted.  
Most of them had been brought back.  
I found what I was looking for, took out a box, and started taking out
beautiful glass vials.

"...Lord Marquis?"

"Get me some empty wine bottles.  
I want to use them."

"Understood, immediately."

――The monster attack on the village occurred a week later.
