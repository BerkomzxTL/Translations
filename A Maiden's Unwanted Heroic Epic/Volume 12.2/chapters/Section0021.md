# Chapter 331 - Super Galaxy Queen☆Krischeria \~The beloved princess with a strong destiny finds happiness in a kind world~

AN

Thank you for enjoying The Girl's Unwanted Heroic Tale.

It’s been about three years since it ended.

After re-reading this work, I came to the realization that The Girl's
Unwanted Heroic Tale is indeed a work riddled with many problems.

Not to mention typos and poorly written sentences, there are also cruel
descriptions and plots scattered throughout the book, and the
protagonists are constantly faced with conflicts that they have no
answers to, making it a completely unpopular story.

It is in the suffering that a story has depth and interest.

What is the appeal of a story with characters without conflict?

With that in mind, I deliberately created the work in that way, but
looking back at it, I can see that it is overall a very dark, depressing
story.

Ultimately, this work is about seven beautiful girls living together
forever in yuri yuri relationships.

"Yuri Yuri ☆ Happy Eternal Ending ☆"

It ends with a truly absurd conclusion that has never been seen before,
but many people are abandoned by the hardships along the way, and the
ending itself is made possible by many sacrifices.

Many people who could have avoided death depending on how they met and
who could have built good relationships with the main characters died.

Just a little button mis-fastened.

They die for reasons written in the story, and their deaths are so sad
and so cruel.

When this is added to the conflict mentioned above, it creates what can
be described as a '(;\_;)↓ dark synergistic effect ↓ (;\_;)'.

The positive aspects of the piece, "o(^\_^)o↑Mansion Yuri Yuri
Effect↑o(^\_^)o", have been washed away, and the content has become more
gloomy.

In this full remake, we have made significant improvements, especially
to the coincidence aspect, so that the people who were pushed aside in
order to make way for the girls' happiness can be picked up -
strengthening the "system where characters appear or meet at just the
right time, and end up becoming good friends."

I am planning to completely revise the story with the goal of creating
"The Unwanted Heroic Tale of a Girl Who Never Buttons Herself Up Wrong."

In addition, the title, which sounds dark from the very appearance, "A
Girl's Unwanted Heroic Tale," has been changed accordingly.

"Super Galaxy Queen☆Krischeria ~The beloved princess with an
overwhelming destiny finds happiness in a kind world~"

Please note that this will be the case.

The book is currently in the process of being revised, and some people
may be anxious about what the story will be.

Please enjoy the main text as a digest version of the beginning that
will give you an idea of ​​the atmosphere.

(※Important) Announcement of the full remake of The Girl Who Unwanted
Heroes.

That was an April Fool's joke…

—---

Uncle and Niece: Part 1

Apparently, after rejecting much advice, my older brother Shelberza
finally decided to raise her, who had been under house arrest, as a
princess.  
Gildenstein thinks it's unusual for his serious brother, unless he
particularly cherishes his concubine's child.  
The name given to her is Krischeria, a noble moon that arcs
incompletely.  
The royal family name must always be perfect.  
In that respect, the name is inconsistent, a name imbued with the guilt
of breaking tradition.

“…Your Highness, the younger brother of the King.”

“I’ve only come to see my niece. Don’t be so tense. …What are you
doing?”

When he arrived at her room, the servants were tense, but Gildenstein
entered without hesitation.  
Five-year-old Krischeria was holding a vase and polishing it with a
cloth.  
Beautiful silver hair and eyes like jewels, a purple hue. A white
one-piece dress.  
Her expressionless tilting of her head apparently appears eerie to
many.  
Even without words, those in the royal palace knew she was the hated
illegitimate child who had been confined, and the pressure from her
emotionless eyes likely made them feel that way.

Her eyes, which observe every movement of her counterpart, were like a
snake. They were unlike any eyes Gildenstein had ever seen.

“…? I'm polishing a vase.”

Exasperated by the look that seemed to say, “Can’t you see?”, he says,

“I can see that. I just wanted to know why you, a princess, are doing
the cleaning.”

“Ha…”

“…I’m sorry, that—”

“It’s fine. I’m used to it. …Tea.”

A dark-haired servant with a melancholic face bowed deeply and brewed
tea.  
Gildenstein, still watching Krischeria polish the vase, rested his cheek
on his hand at the window seat.  
A strange child—perhaps because she had been imprisoned in a tower, or
perhaps it was her nature.  
When she finished polishing the vase, she smiled contentedly, then
toddled towards him.

“Is there something you want to talk about with Krische?”

“I only came to see your face to alleviate boredom. Don’t shorten your
name.”

“Krischeria is long… even Father says it’s okay.”

My brother, perhaps out of guilt, was quite lenient with Krischeria.

“…Enough already. I’d rather teach a dog than lecture you.”

“Krische is smarter than a dog.”

“Yes, she is. Too smart for me to be her master.”

He absentmindedly stroked her head; Krischeria looked at it and relaxed
her mouth.  
Apparently, she had learned both reading and arithmetic instantly, her
intelligence was beyond that of an ordinary human. Her younger sister
was the same—though only two years old, she learned from her onee-sama
and mastered things instantly.  
They were geniuses beyond the word.  
That was one reason why they were disliked.  
Most people feel that way about beings that surpass their understanding.
Some loved them, but most kept their distance.

She sipped the tea placed by a servant named Nora, and the topic turned
to their tutors. Apparently, there was no one who could properly educate
them; two tutors had quickly requested reassignments. Being too smart
was a problem—they apparently couldn’t have a proper conversation.
Scholars, in particular, were proud and often delicate. The mathematics
tutor, it seemed, had suffered a mental breakdown after Krischeria
instantly solved a proof he had been working on as a life’s purpose.

“It’s a problem to have such useless scholars as tutors. I’ll tell my
brother. In the meantime, read all the books in the royal library. If
you’re serious about it, you should be able to finish them in two or
three years.”

“Books…”

“I’m not saying you have to understand everything. Just remember what
you don’t understand. You can ask my brother later. If you have free
time, I’ll explain it to you as far as I understand. …I think learning
from books is better for you than learning from a tutor.”

“Hmm, that might be so. Is that the end after I finish reading them?”

“No.  
You’ll still need a tutor for things like horseback riding that you
can't learn from books.”

Krischeria made an openly displeased face.

“What? If you don’t like your tutor, we can change them.”

“Horseback riding hurts my bottom. It seems faster to run.”

“You should endure it a little. It’s knowledge that won’t hurt to have.
Horses are convenient for long distances.”

Krischeria had already mastered physical augmentation.  
She was outstanding not only in intelligence but in all talents. If she
weren’t so strange, there would be nothing more to say; but, there's no
such thing as a perfect person.

“Then there's self-defense… swordsmanship and such. I can teach you if
you want, but it’ll be after this is over. You’re still too small, and
your brother would hate it.”

“Should I learn that too?”

“Yes. As someone born into the royal family, you never know when your
life might be targeted.  
Learning self-defense can't hurt. You'll learn it quickly.”

“Certainly, that might be so…”

She tilted her head, pondered, and nodded. Then, she picked up a cookie
and stared intently at him.

“…?”

“No. Do you dislike cookies?”

“It’s not that… I don’t particularly like them either.”

Raising an eyebrow, wondering what she meant, he looked at Nora, who
bowed her head in fear.

“Today’s cookies… were made by Krischeria-sama.  
Her lessons ended early, and she had some free time, so she thought she
might be able to learn something… I’m sorry.”

“I see. Don’t be so afraid. I don’t intend to do anything to you or
her.”

“…I’m sorry.”

What a troublesome woman.  
She seemed terribly afraid of Gildenstein, showing fear in her every
move. Sighing at Krischeria’s constant glances between Nora and himself,
he took a cookie and ate it. It was an unremarkable cookie, only
slightly sweeter than what he usually ate.

“Hehe, is it delicious?”

“It’s average. Not bad, but too sweet.”

“Hmm… I think Krische made them very well. Kreschenta said they were
delicious too.”

“Your taste buds are just off.”

He replied, and Krischeria tilted her head again, humming to herself,
and took another cookie.  
He was about to get up, having finished his business, when a rustling
sound came from the bed, and her sister, Kreschenta, sat up.  
She rubbed her eyes sleepily, then made a surprised face upon seeing
Gildenstein, and naturally jumped onto her sister’s lap.  
She stared intently, saying nothing, as was her habit.

“I only came to see my niece.”

“…”

He said this, and she turned away, hugging Krischeria tightly. Still
only two years old—but just like Krischeria, a child who didn't cry.  
He knew she spoke fluently, but unlike her sister, she was introverted,
barely speaking to anyone but her sister and Nora.  
She looked like a baby, but her mentality seemed somewhat more sensible
than Krischeria’s.

“Kreschenta, you have to greet properly.”

“…Hello.”

“You have to look at the person when you greet them.  
No cookies until you can greet properly.”

When Krischeria said this, she pursed her lips and reluctantly said
hello, looking sideways.  
Krischeria grumbled, but gave her sister a cookie.

“It’s fine here, but act a little more appropriately and charmingly in
front of others.  
It doesn’t matter to me that you and your sister aren’t what you seem,
but some people dislike it.”

Kreschenta glanced at him sideways and clung to her sister again.

“…Krische is what she seems.”

“Yes, you are what you seem, in a way.”

“In a way…”

While outstanding in talent and intellect, her spirit was that of a
quiet five-year-old, as expected from her looks.  
He wondered about it for a moment, then seemed to lose interest as
quickly as he’d gained it.  
Stroking his niece's head, he looked thoughtful, then asked, as if
remembering something:

“Oh, by the way, there was something I wanted to ask.”

“Something you want to ask?”

“Yes, I heard that you always torture innocent people for fun—”

“Krischeria-sama!”

“Mguh?”

Nora hastily covered Krischeria’s mouth.  
Then, she bowed her head in fear.

“I… I’m so sorry, that—”

“Let go of her, I don’t mind. …What’s wrong with that?”

Krischeria, released from Nora’s grasp, looked at Nora with a troubled
expression, then back at Gildenstein.

“No, because of that, you’ve lost a lot of respect.  
Krische feel like it is lowering Krische’s reputation too.  
Honestly, Krische really wish you would stop.”

“It's true that you're crazy.  
It's not entirely my fault.”

“Hmm… Even so. Krische think it’s best to have as few reasons to lose
respect as possible.”

Krischeria said this in a grumpy tone, then asked:

“If you had some reason for it, I wouldn't say anything, but I think you
should stop if it's not necessary…  
Is there any good that comes from doing it?”

“Not really. …If I had to say, I get a lot of information.”

“Information…”

“When I torture them, they talk, and merchants who come to sell things
give me information. It’s just a bonus to the fun… but, by the time you
were born, I'd gotten tired of it. I only do it occasionally now.”

It had started as mere torture.  
He had personally tormented criminals, venting various frustrations.  
When that disappeared, he continued, using information gathering as a
pretext, buying slaves from other countries and repeating it.  
At some point, the torture itself became the goal, and he would buy
slaves who caught his interest, and he would revel in the time he spent
seeing faces that he wouldn’t normally see.

From ordinary criminals to arrogant ones, humble ones, simply unlucky
ones, righteous but incompetent or foolish ones.  
In extreme situations, people showed Gildenstein their true faces.

Some would beg for mercy when it came to cutting off limbs.  
Some would say nothing, but speak with three fingernails.

Or those who cursed Gildenstein as a rotten villain, never changing
their attitude even when driven mad.  
Those who held the soul of a noble, sacrificing themselves for their
ideals.

Perhaps that was what he had wanted to see.  
The pastime had become a habit around that time.  
He could tell the difference just by looking at their eyes and speaking
to them briefly.  
There’s nothing more boring than a game where you already know the
answer.

“So you’ve stopped?”

“I just occasionally buy slaves I like and keep them at the mansion. I
go to slave betting matches and shows, but only as a formality. It’s
that level of entertainment…  
Are you interested in coming along next time?”

“Krische won’t go. Krische’s telling you that your strange pastime is
lowering Krische's reputation.”

Krischeria frowned and glared at him.

“If you say you've stopped, that's fine. If it's just a formality, then
there might be some unavoidable aspects. But please try your best to
avoid creating strange rumors as much as possible. If your reputation
gets any worse and lowers Krische’s evaluation, Krische will cut ties
with you.”

“You’re ungrateful.”

“Because Krische thinks you've been good to Krische, Krische’s saying
this for your sake. Krische thinks it's better to make an effort to be
liked than to be disliked… right, Nora?”

“Uh, um…”

Nora, unable to interject, looked around fearfully, and Krischeria
tilted her head. Kreschenta yawned sleepily and looked at her sister
with a bored expression.

“What's the point of being liked by everyone?”

“…What? I think it goes without saying that being liked is better than
being disliked. Being disliked has disadvantages, but being liked has
advantages.”

The girl simply explained the world she saw.  
Her clear purple eyes held no doubt.  
There was no complex reasoning, no talk of being a noble, a royal, or a
person; it was divided simply into profit and loss.  
Watching her, he thought she was wonderfully simple-minded.

“In Krische’s experience, this investment is very profitable. The profit
margin is extremely high. Krische was surprised that you didn't
understand… Oh, that’s right.”

Calling him “uncle,” she beckoned him gently.  
Gildenstein frowned and approached, and she beckoned again.  
Before he could ask what she intended, her small hand touched his head,
and moved. Nora was speechless.

“…What are you doing?”

“A reward. If you do well, Krische will pet you.  
Krische’ll also try my best to bake cookies that you will say are
delicious. Krische thinks this kind of clear reward is motivating.”

“Don’t do that with you and Kreschenta.”

He was not angry, but exasperated, and took Krischeria's hand and let
go. Krischeria hummed thoughtfully.

“…Well, I understand your point. I’ll think about it.”

“Hmm, Krische wants you to do it more than just think about it… Oh,
Krische’s thinking of baking a cake next time. Krische’ll give some to
you too.”

“No thanks.”

Uncle and Niece: Part 2

Some time later, he attended a gathering of scum.  
He watched the scum fawning over him and spent his time idly watching
the madness.  
It was a terribly boring time.  
When he felt bored, he usually ordered someone to alleviate his boredom,
but he didn’t even feel like doing that.

Unknowingly, he was thinking about Krischeria.  
His thoughts turned to what he should teach her next, then to what he
wanted to do with her.  
In the first place, what did he want to do?  
It was a question he couldn't answer.

However, he didn't feel as bored as before.  
It was far superior as a pastime, an activity that never became boring.

“…What is this, Gil?”

“Just as it says, brother, a list of names.  
What they do is also included.  
Deal with them as you see fit.  
Those guys are good at hiding their tails, so if you're going to do it,
do it all at once.”

In the King's room—the walls were adorned with armor, swords, and
paintings of battlefields. Shelberza Alberan, like Gildenstein, sighed,
running a hand through his golden hair.  
They were said to look alike.  
Their builds were also similar; the only difference was whether they had
beards or not.

“I’m asking you what you intend to do.”

“I’m just tired of them. I’m tired of dealing with them. Don’t worry;
I’ve kept some useful pieces separate. You can do as you like with
them.”

He poured wine into a glass for Shelberza and Shelberza stared at it.  
He poured some for himself and sipped it.  
It was quite a high-quality wine.

“…Are you doing this for—?”

“Kuku, being too kind is your greatest flaw, brother. Do you still trust
me? …Drink. It’s a brand I’m trying for the first time, but it’s a good
wine, considering the price.”

Shelberza sighed, quietly drank the wine, and swallowed. Then he said,

“I don’t think you’re a rotten villain at heart. …If only things had
been a little different, this wouldn’t have happened.”

“There are no ‘what ifs’ in the past, brother. Everything is inevitable…
it happened as it should have.”

“The choices you made after your hesitation… are not necessarily what it
would have been. I still believe you were the most suitable person to be
king.  
It wasn’t just me, many thought so at the time. …But I had doubts.”

He said this with self-mockery and stood up.  
He took the king’s sword, Bezeria, from the wall.

"Weakness leads to hesitation. I didn't want to admit that I wasn't fit
to be king.  
I thought it was too early to give up, that I could still make an
effort, and so I delayed telling you that I was relinquishing my claim
to the throne."

He drew the greatsword, permitted only to the king, from its scabbard
and gazed at it.  
Shelberza's face was reflected in the beautiful blade.

"The royal sword, Bezeria, was a sword dedicated to the founding king,
Bazalishe. Its cloudless blade reflects his pure heart, and the handle
bears his clear purple eyes that pursued the ideal… I secretly gazed at
this sword, my father's, and saw myself reflected in it. Even now, if I
look at it, my face clouds this blade."

Returning the sword to its scabbard, Shelberza returned to his seat and
continued.

"More devoted to ideals than anyone else, never doubting that assisting
my father and me was his duty… If you call that being too kind, then
you're the one who is, Gil. I wasn't born with as pure a heart as you."

"Certainly, I won't deny that I was a fool back then,"

I replied with a laugh, and Shelberza gazed at the surface of the wine.

"Because you were so devoted to ideals, I understand the depth of your
disappointment. I should have told you my feelings like this sooner. My
foolish and sticky emotions… they would have faded with your becoming a
true king, and I wouldn't be regretting this now."

"There's no use talking about the past,"

"True… But perhaps there's still something we can change in the future."

Shelberza emptied his wine and raised his glass. Gildenstein poured him
more.

"I haven't forgotten the many promises you made to me. And you haven't
forgotten them either. Even if you repeated those vulgar games, you
still fulfilled your duties as the king's younger brother and supported
me."

"I'm just doing enough work to avoid getting my head chopped off."

"No… No matter how much you become disillusioned with the world, you do
that only to avoid sullying the words you swore in your name, Gil… I'm
still your older brother. I know that no matter what, you are a man who
will never abandon the last shred of your aristocratic pride."

—That's why, even though I envy, admire, and hate you, I still can't
kill you.

Shelberza said quietly and laughed.

"Looking at those children, I'm reminded of you in the past. They're
very much alike."

"That's going a bit too far, even for a joke."

"I'm not joking… Seeing you and those children, I understand why crying
babies are called illegitimate children.  
This world is simply too dirty for those who are too pure to live in
it."

Then, looking up at the ceiling, he continued.

"I'm glad I avoided making another foolish choice.  
The fact that you came to see me today was probably because of those
children, wasn't it?  
I can tell by looking at you."

"Feel free to interpret it however you like."

He tilted his wine, and Shelberza poured more into the empty glass. Then
he emptied his own glass and smiled.

"This is truly fine wine. …Come next time without anything, and I'll
have my treasured wine brought out."

"…Your brother's taste is a little lacking, so I won't get my hopes up
too much."

"I'll have you revise that opinion next time."

Shelberza said with a laugh, and took a sip of wine.

"I'll leave those two to you. Show them what you want to show them, what
you wanted to see. I'm sure they'll eventually show you the scenery
you've longed for in your heart."

"Don't blame me if the country splits apart."

"If I leave it to you now, that certainly won't happen."

Closing his eyes, Shelberza smiled.

\[Uncle and Niece: 3\]

Royal family members have many obligations to attend ceremonies, most of
which are boring.  
However, among them, victory celebrations are the only ones I don't
dislike.

I read the battle reports that were sent, imagining in my head what the
battle was like. How the soldiers fought, what agonizing decisions the
commanders made, and what the outcome was.  
While thinking about the words I'll speak at the victory ceremony, I
listened to the warriors' resonant steel, the cacophony of life and
death.

Some people, like Dougleen Garhka, sent reports that were too concise
and lacked interest, but this time the main battlefield was the west;  
Aurugorn Hilkintos and Elderant. While Aurugorn, who never takes risks
in his battles, isn't to my liking, his excessively detailed reports are
quite good as reading material.  
It's funny how he looks like a great general when you read his reports
individually.

As one of the generals guarding the four corners of the kingdom,
Aurugorn is certainly a capable man.  
However, he's a man who thoroughly pursues victory and avoids direct
confrontation until he eliminates all chances of defeat, and he hates to
blemish his undefeated record.  
The west, a victim of this obsession, is always in turmoil; it should be
a quite wealthy land, but it has the lowest tax revenue among the four
directions.

He spins these sacrifices into a tale of 'the enemy's despicable
surprise attack and the violation of the people,' adding a narrative of
'hearing the cries of the pitiful people who were occupied and
oppressed, launching a desperate counterattack,' and 'successfully
bringing down the righteous hammer upon the evil barbarians with their
great army.'  
It's always the same structure.

This time, Aurugorn bought time by retreating until Gildenstein arrived.
At the same time as Bogan's rapid advance from the north cut off the
enemy's rear, they launched a counteroffensive together with
Gildenstein. The battle ended with Gildenstein obtaining the enemy
commander's head.  
The details of the maneuver are familiar;  
it's his usual method of shifting the blame to 'sacrifices' by allowing
Gildenstein and the central army's generals to take credit.  
This time, he wrote about Gildenstein obtaining the enemy commander's
head in such a sensational way, as if he were there, describing it as
"His Highness's valiant efforts," making me, the person involved,
dumbfounded.

The credit or petty self-preservation is irrelevant.  
I get nauseous if I'm praised too much, and I don't like those shifty
eyes.  
On my way west, I always think about giving him some excuse, such as
neglecting the protection of the people, to punish him, but I’m in a
good mood after the war game.  
Seeing that he eventually makes me forgive him some degree of
unpleasantness, maybe he's quite a strategist after all.

"What are you doing?"

"…? We're braiding Kreschenta's and Grandpa's beard."

"Haha, it seems you've taken quite a liking to my beard."

After the victory ceremony, the banquet began. As I looked for the two,
I found them in a corner braiding Felworth's long white beard.  
With the beard parted to the sides, Krischelia in a black dress and
Kreschenta in a white dress were each braiding the beard, and Felworth
was laughing merrily.

"Hehe, Kreschenta, you're skilled."

"Onee-sama's teaching is great."

"Indeed, the younger sister of Krische. I'll pet you later."

"Yes…!"

Gildenstein was dumbfounded by the two – the kingdom's first and second
princesses – wearing elegant dresses and braiding the beard.  
Nine and six;  
While they look more grown-up, they're still as foolish as ever.  
Even Kreschenta, who seemed to have slightly more sensibility compared
to Krischelia, was becoming increasingly foolish like her sister day by
day.

"Uncle?"

"……What are you doing?"

I grabbed both of their necks, pulled them apart and told Felworth,

"Don't spoil them. What are you going to do if they become even more
foolish?"

"I'm sorry, Your Highness. They were just so cute..."

"...Onee-sama and I are smarter than you, Uncle."

"No matter how clever you are, if you look foolish, then you are
foolish. Try to have some awareness of your position as princesses."

Kreschenta glared at me, puffing her cheeks in displeasure.

"Come along, it's time for greetings."

"Understood… Kreschenta, don't get angry like that. Uncle is
short-tempered, so it can't be helped. Krische and the others need to
learn from this."

"Hmph… All right."

"That's right, good girl. Don't become like Uncle."

I put the playful conversation behind me.  
Sounds like a cry—There is no point in getting angry at it.

As I pushed my way through the crowd, I found the man I was looking for.

"Christand, Krischelia and Kreschenta are here."

"My, my… It's an honor to meet you, both Princesses."

Bogan Christand knelt on one knee, and his wife, Lazura, with her red
hair tied up and wearing a blue dress, made a curtsey. The usually
foolish two understood the basic etiquette and made a perfect curtsey,
just like in a textbook. Bogan frowned slightly for a moment at the
flawless movements of the two, from beginning to end, and Lazura's
cat-like eyes widened.

"I am Bogan Christand, and this is my wife, Lazura. Compared to our
great predecessors, we are still lacking in ability; nonetheless, we are
entrusted with guarding the north as one of the four generals."

"Uh… We know. Your glorious military achievements so far, the fact that
warriors like you are fulfilling their duties with their lives on the
line for the kingdom, as the First Princess, I'm very happy about it.
Your recent performance was magnificent."

"Your words are too kind."

Krischelia, having uttered a semi-formulaic phrase, glanced at
Gildenstein.  
She seemed to be asking if she could leave after the greetings, but I
completely ignored her.

"I wanted to introduce her to you. As you probably know, I had her
accompany me and let her try her hand at strategy. It must have been
much easier to move around."

"Yes, Your Highness… I have heard some things about you, but…"

Bogan was perplexed by the girl's child-like appearance.  
I laughed and said,

"She's this generation's Reine, Bogan. She may look like a kid, but I
wouldn't hesitate to call her a genius."

"Reine…"

"Well, just consider today as a greeting. I'll take her to your place
eventually."

"…Yes."

Then, I told Krischelia,

"This man is the general and warrior I trust most. He'll be of help to
you in the future, so remember him well."

"Hmm… Nice to meet you. Thanks to the General's support, we finished the
battle early, and if you continue to work like that, Krische will be
happy."

As soon as she stopped using formal phrases, she was back to her usual
self. I'd given up hoping for anything else.

"No, my success is thanks to my excellent subordinates and the
assistance of the central army… Was it Princess Krischelia who devised
that strategic maneuver?"

"Uh… Was it the one where the enemy was on two fronts?"

"Yes."

"Well, yes. Thanks to them moving quickly, we were able to completely
encircle them."

The enemy divided their forces against Christand's army advancing from
the north, Hilkintos' army from the east, and the central army.  
Krischelia ordered Hilkintos' army to advance south, creating the
illusion of a three-sided encirclement from north, east, and south,
drawing the enemy's attention to the south.  
Then, at that moment, she used a fast-moving unit composed of lightly
armed infantry and cavalry commanded by Gildenstein, making a forceful
incursion from the northeast.  
By hinting at attacks from the east and south by the central army main
force and Hilkintos' army, they stopped the movement of the main enemy
force and separated the Nozan group—the northern enemy, who were taken
by surprise by Gildenstein's unit and losing their composure were
annihilated by Christand's army.  
Quickly cutting off the west, which would be the rear, Gildenstein
closed in on the north.  
The battle, which began with equal numbers of troops, ended in an
extremely rare complete encirclement.

A landslide victory with a damage ratio of over 1:10 is not something
you see often. However, Krischelia had easily achieved it just by
strategic maneuvering.

"In that battle, there is no one who could have achieved a better
result. Our army's strategist, Commander Faren, also praised her skill
without reservation. Excuse me, but to think that was the Princess
Krischelia's strategy…"

"Krische wanted to reduce the losses a bit more… Using the forest as the
main battlefield was not ideal. If it were a plain, Eldrant would have
been a rabble."

Kreschenta, watching her sister being praised, listened silently but
with a smug expression. She probably thought, 'Of course, it's to be
expected of my onee-sama.'  
She's so foolish.  
I had brought Kreschenta along because she wouldn't leave her sister's
side, but all she did was cling to Krischelia—she's even worse than
Krischelia, who at least tries to appear serious.  
I told Bogan while feeling annoyed,

"She's like this.  
Considering her age, she still has several issues when it comes to
commanding an army. I'll let her study under me for some time… to
broaden her knowledge, I'd like to show her your army sometime if we
have an opportunity."

"My army…?"

"In my opinion, your army is the most well-rounded and elite. Including
your high-quality subordinates, it's a completed form.  
I thought your place would be appropriate in terms of letting her study
the reward and punishment system and how the army is structured. Have
that in mind."

"…Yes, thank you for your kind words."

"That's about it. Let's go—? What's wrong, Krischelia?"

Krischelia, as usual, was looking at Lazura with a vacant expression.  
To be precise, a little lower.

"Uh, Princess Krischelia, is there something…?"

"Oh, you're pregnant."

"Pregnant…? Ah, yes, I have a daughter—"

"Uh, not that one, this one."

Krischelia pointed to Lazura's lower abdomen. Lazura, looking
bewildered, looked at where her finger was pointing and stared blankly.

"Do you mean Lazura is pregnant…?"

"Yes. I felt something strange about her magic… Maybe I was wrong?"

Krischelia answered Bogan's question. Bogan frowned and asked Lazura,

"Were there any signs?"

"Not yet, like…"

"Christand.  
I suppose you don't have any plans. I'll let you borrow a mansion in the
royal territory.  
Stay there for a while."

"Your Highness…"

"Don't underestimate her intuition. Let's see what happens. If it's not
true, then so be it."

"…Yes. I am grateful for your kindness."

Bogan bowed his head and looked at Lazura, who was dumbfounded. Lazura,
looking confused, averted her gaze when their eyes met.

She probably remembered being treated like a slave.  
Even now, when Lazura's eyes met mine, she didn't show it on her face,
but she still looked uneasy.  
However, she couldn't hide it well in this situation, and I smiled
wryly.

"If you really are pregnant, you should avoid long carriage rides for a
while. Christand's child will be someone who will shoulder the future of
the kingdom.  
Accept it without worrying."

"…Yes, Your Highness."

"Unlike the countryside in the north, the royal capital has good doctors
and midwives. When the day gets closer, I will send them to you. …Well,
there's still a possibility that it's just a foolish mistake on her
part, but we'll know the results then."

I patted Krischelia's head, and she pouted.

"Krische just asked out of curiosity… Krische doesn't understand why
Krische’s the foolish one if Krische’s wrong."

"It goes without saying. You're a foolish person to begin with."

"Hmph…"

Seeing her sister getting angry, Kreschenta glared at Gildenstein and
said in a small voice,

"Onee-sama, don't get mad."

She hugged her sister and stroked her head.

"You'll become like our short-tempered uncle."

"…Hmm, that's right. We need to learn from uncle's mistakes."

"…I can hear you, you little brats."

And at that exchange, Bogan and Lazura unwittingly exchanged glances.

'Uncle and Niece: 4'

As it turned out, Krischelia's hunch was correct, and Lazura stayed in
the royal territory for a while.  
She was sent back to Bogan's mansion at a stable time, but as a result,
the second child's birth apparently ended in a sad outcome.  
It seems Lazura almost lost her life, and she remained in a precarious
condition for a long time.  
A long letter arrived from Bogan expressing his gratitude for sending a
famous doctor.

After all, since it ended in a stillbirth, there was no reason to be
thanked.  
I wrote a perfunctory letter of condolence and let several years pass.  
Getting increasingly fed up with the two of them doing nothing but
eating, sleeping, making sweets, and playing around, I took them to
Garugain.

The two of them continuously complained in the carriage—about their sore
bottoms and hunger—so I left them with Nora and reluctantly traveled by
horse.  
I have never regretted saying it would be fine to be in the same
carriage so much.

Upon arrival, a small, red-haired servant greeted us at the main gate.  
Though the atmosphere was different, she had red hair.  
Her features also vaguely resembled them.  
It seems she was Lazura’s younger sister, having stayed in the royal
territory for a while in exchange for Bogan because it was lonely to
leave her alone.

‘If you can give my sister genuine love and happiness… then I don’t
mind.’

Her intelligent light brown eyes vaguely resembled the two of them.

We were guided into the mansion, where Bogan and Lazura were waiting,
along with their only daughter, Selene.  
With her beautiful golden hair and strong-willed eyes—she seemed
somewhat stiff and nervous—but she greatly resembled her parents.  
She seemed destined to become a fine noblewoman like her parents.

"As I wrote in the letter… the matter of the child was unfortunate,
Christand."

"No. …Just the fact that Lazura is safe now is a blessing. I shudder to
imagine what would have happened without Lord Kirkul, whom Your Highness
sent… I am truly grateful."

"No need for thanks. It's only natural considering your efforts."

Entering the drawing-room, we first talked about that.  
It seems she was indeed in quite a dangerous state.  
Stopping Bogan, who looked like he would endlessly bow his head, I
asked:

"However, I heard rumors… is it really only one servant?"

"No… there are two now. During our recent stay, one of the servants from
the Ilne mansion, where Lazura stayed…"

‘Argan-sama, please leave the carrying of luggage to me—!?’

‘Ah, Anne-sama… a-are you alright?’

At the faint sound of someone falling and a voice from beyond the door,
Bogan chuckled.

"……At that time, my younger sister, Berry, seemed quite fond of my
sister-in-law and asked to serve her. She’s a bit clumsy, so she may
cause some inconvenience."

"She'll be back in a few days. I don't mind. These two fools wouldn't
mind either—"

"……Krische isn't a fool."

"……Nor am I, you know."

"Shut up. …You may be doing it intentionally, but excessive stinginess
will lead to being underestimated."

"Thank you for your advice. If necessary, even during your stay, a few
people from Nozan…"

Gildanstein said not to take it too seriously.  
He then looked at Selene, who stood stiffly with a tense expression.

"Selene"

"Y-yes, Your Highness"

"This isn't a formal occasion.  
It's troublesome, so 'Your Highness' is unnecessary.  
For these two as well. There's nothing to gain from showing politeness,
and these two are the kind who walk hand-in-hand with impoliteness and
rudeness. Think of it as just a dog with the title of Princess of the
Alberan Kingdom."

"U-um…"

"……My uncle is far more impolite than Krische and the others—"

"Don't interrupt."

Selene looked back and forth between the grumpy two and Gildanstein,
looking confused.

"Well, eventually, you'll understand what I meant. …The purpose of this
stay is to have these two learn about military affairs, but they're
close in age.  
Normally, you will inevitably have to look after them, but treat it as
taking care of some dim-witted dogs and take it easy."

"Y-yes… I understand."

"If you don't like something, feel free to discipline them. I've given
up."

Selene stuttered, unable to answer properly, and Gildanstein looked away
and sipped his tea.  
A knock came at that moment, and Bogan allowed entry.  
Lazura's sister skillfully carried two large plates, one in each arm,
laden with cookies.  
She seemed to have made the tea and carried their luggage, but must have
left it to someone else.  
She bowed once and placed one plate near Gildanstein and the other near
Bogan and the others.

Gildanstein casually moved the plate out of reach of the two, who
immediately reached for it.  
He then turned his gaze to Bogan.

"Let me tell you… my brother intends to appoint these two as his
successors."

"…"

"The other princes aren't exactly incompetent, but they lack something
innate.  
Even if the throne is inherited by them, they will eventually find these
two troublesome. It will only increase the trouble.  
However, even if we ignore tradition, we can’t avoid troublesome
matters. We need to create achievements beforehand that the nobles will
have no choice but to accept without complaint."

"I see… but even so, sending them to the battlefield is too…"

"Didn't I say Reine?  
For better or worse, she doesn't have ordinary sensibilities. …Thinking
with the yardstick of an ordinary person won't help these two."

Gildanstein then felt a gaze and turned to the two sitting to his
left.  
They were staring at him sullenly, showing absolutely no interest in the
conversation.

"I'm having a serious conversation.  
And it's about you two. Can't you even wait?"

"……Krische thinks we can listen to the conversation while eating
cookies, though."

"Yes, we can."

"……Fine. That's enough. But be quiet then."

Sighing, he returned the plate, and Bogan laughed, seemingly
unintentionally.  
He narrowed his eyes and smiled at me.

"Excuse me… you've changed quite a bit."

"I don't feel like I have changed."

"……You may not realize it yourself, but your atmosphere is much
gentler.  
Your harshness has subsided, so to speak… I felt it even at the
banquet."

I stared blankly at Bogan, who told me it was a good change.  
It was the same words Felworth had said.

"Perhaps, their presence…?"

Bogan then looked at the two, tilted his head, and Gildanstein also
turned his gaze towards them.  
Krischelia froze, staring at her half-eaten cookie.  
Her eyes widened, and her hand holding the cookie trembled.  
Frowning at this rare sight, Berry spoke in a flustered manner.

"I-I'm sorry. If it doesn't suit your taste, I will—"

"T-that…"

"Y-yes…"

Krischelia, jumping up, looked at Berry and spoke.

"T-that… how… how did you make this!?"

A glittering purple color, unlike anything she had ever seen.  
Gildanstein pressed his forehead and sighed.

Krischelia Alberan—Queen of the Alberan Kingdom.  
Leader of the Supergalactic Fuyo-yon Alliance.

With her younger sister, Kreschenta Alberan, at her side, she expanded
Alberan, once a single nation on the continent, and achieved world
unification.  
Her magical inventions ended the age of heroes and rapidly propelled the
era to the next stage.  
In subsequent space exploration, she encountered numerous aliens and
cosmic lifeforms, achieving galactic unification and establishing the
Supergalactic Fuyo-yon Alliance through the Fuyo-yon Network,
establishing an absolute system of rule.

Even now, she is widely known as an unparalleled ruler in this universe,
and is worshipped as a god and object of faith by some races.

Born in a world of war, she deeply loved peace, and led the universe to
peace.  
Her name is always spoken with much praise. However, her true appearance
is not known to many—

"Hehe, Berry, what are we making today?"

"Well… let’s make Ojou-sama’s favorite meat pie today. She seems rather
tired from all the various affairs of state…"

Her likes: cooking, eating, and being pampered.

Her specialties: being pampered.

—This is a story about a slightly eccentric girl who, surrounded by kind
people, is happily drowned without much conflict.
