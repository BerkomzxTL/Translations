# Chapter 354 - Krische's Krische: Evening

Breakfast is basically prepared by two people. Lunch preparation varies,
and dinner is usually made by three.  
Selene occasionally participates to kill time, but today is as usual.

Kreschenta is silly, spoiled, sloppy, and a clingy person who can't be
straightforward, but she's quite good at cooking.  
Her complaints and bad temper never decrease, but she's serious and
meticulous in her work.  
She seems to like cooking, despite her grumbling, and she always
completes her tasks responsibly.

"Letting them do it is important" (from Berry's sayings) is also a quote
from Skeleton's sayings.  
It was used when Keith was entrusted with the equivalent of an
Adjutant's job, a suggestion from Mia.  
Giving responsibility and being recognized for meeting expectations
boosts motivation and encourages growth.  
The tension when Krische entrusts the menu to Berry, and the joy of
taking that small step and meeting expectations, are hard to put into
words.

She's an impossible sister, but she's truly Krische's sister.  
Kreschenta, when entrusted with work by Berry, works hard despite her
grumbling and sometimes produces results that even impress Krische. The
carved pumpkin bowl she holds is a masterpiece created by her when she
was working hard.

The sky is lit by stars and moon.  
Opening the spatially fixed door in the hollow, with a covered pumpkin
and a basket in hand, reveals two dragons.  
Lila sits alone at the roots just before them.  
Around the towering world tree, countless lights—silly spirits—emit a
faint phosphorescence, swimming, fluttering, and darting here and there,
while at their feet, they hop and skip about.  
Seeing the spirits, Krische somehow remembers the children she saw at
Mia's dojo.

Krische doesn't understand what's so interesting about this scenery.  
Berry once said she was enjoying making memories.  
At the time, Krische didn't fully understand, and she still isn't sure
if she understands completely now, but what Berry meant by "enjoyment"
is probably something like this.

When exposed to similar things or situations, memories unexpectedly
surface.  
Remembering the children fighting over the few cookies they brought,
recalling all the trouble they caused… even those memories seem
enjoyable in retrospect.  
It's strange, but that's probably how it is.

Krische has no memories she can't recall.  
But unexpectedly surfacing memories are much more enjoyable than simply
recalling them, and Berry's memories were probably the same, she now
vaguely understands.

Krische can feel this way because Berry tried so hard to create many
memories.  
Every time she recalls an insignificant memory, she feels happy
reflecting on the small travel memories.

Using magic to shoo away a troublesome wind spirit trying to lift her
skirt, she heads to Lila.

"K-Krische-sama…"

Lila, noticing her, turns around in her usual attire, covering only her
chest and waist.  
Kreisharana is a gathering of people who like revealing clothing.  
Krische was taught from childhood that showing thighs and stomach is
indecent, and she continues to believe so even after moving to the
city.  
Since Berry, the epitome of a lady, prefers such attire, Krische also
prefers it, but in Kreisharana, fluttering clothing is apparently
indecent.

Common sense is complicated.  
However, if Berry had grown up in a culture where revealing clothes were
preferred like Lila's, Krische might have easily adopted that culture.  
Considering that, it seems understandable.

"Looking at things from various angles" is also a teaching of Berry's.  
While it's understandable in the heat, Krische thinks Lila should wear
more comfortable clothing in the cold, but she hasn't said anything
about it.

"Ehehe, I also brought pumpkin gratin for Lila."

"I'm, uh, currently in training…"

"Yes. Krische knew you were in training, but Krische made some for you
anyway. Krische thought it would be perfect for a break."

"A-a break…"

Krische nods.

"You've been enduring for about a year now, so Krische thinks the
perfect time to enjoy it has arrived.  
What do you think?"

Opening the lid reveals a rich pumpkin aroma.  
Lila purrs, gazing intently at the gratin.

"This pumpkin gratin is the best pumpkin gratin Berry painstakingly made
for Krische.  
That's why Krische wanted Lila to try it too."

"F-for me…?"

"Yes, if Lila’s only been eating nuts and wild vegetables, Lila, this
will surely move you."

Lila is, among the people in the mansion, the biggest foodie. However,
because she sometimes forgets the value of food, she has a hobby of
regularly undergoing self-imposed training.  
Her training includes things like abstaining from delicious food or
sleeping outdoors instead of on a soft bed.  
The appeal, apparently, is that enduring deprivation enhances the joy of
its end. Her relaxed appearance after breaking her fast in the mansion
is truly indescribably happy.

If Krische had lived like Lila, and then eaten Berry's cooking… just
imagining it makes her mouth water.

The first time Krische, after leaving the village, tasted Berry's
cooking, it was a world-altering shock.  
However, she doesn't have the confidence to push herself to that extent
again to experience that same feeling.  
Considering this, Lila, who works so hard just to eat delicious food, is
an overwhelming gourmand compared to Krische.  
Krische even feels a certain degree of respect for her dedication to
food.

Elvena, who happened to appear in the kitchen, offered to help, and as a
result, another pumpkin gratin was made.  
It's a good opportunity. Today's pumpkin gratin is exquisite, the
ultimate delicacy that rewards Lila's efforts.

Krische hands Lila a pumpkin and a spoon, and Lila scoops up some gratin
with trembling hands.  
She cautiously takes a bite, savors it, closes her eyes, and…

"Lila?"

Tears silently roll down her closed eyelids.

"It's… delicious.  
So delicious…"

She purrs, gazes blankly at the sky, wipes her eyes, and looks at the
gratin again.  
Tears of joy—this is what being overwhelmed feels like. Krische has
experienced this, but never from just eating food. Smiling, Krische
figures she must have been enduring a lot and shows her the basket of
bread.

"I also brought some bread, would you like some? Ehehe, this is freshly
baked."

Lila nods and cautiously picks up a piece of bread and bites into it.  
She eats the gratin and then bread, becoming completely engrossed.  
The first piece of bread disappears quickly into Lila's stomach.

"You can eat as much as you want. Your break… um, right.  
Tomorrow, let's have a skewer party with Lila's favorite meat!"

"T-that's…"

"It's okay. Lila’s endured for a year, so it's alright to indulge a
little.  
It'll be super delicious."

"J-just a little…"

"Yes, no one will get mad if you skip training for a bit… right,
Regalave-san?"

She asks, and Regalave looks at her with large eyes, his magical power
crackling.

『What do you ask me for? Eat as much as you like.』

"See, even Regalave-san says so."

"R-Regalave-sama also…"

"Yes.  
If Lila really wants to continue your training, Krische won't force
you…  
but deprivation is bad for your body, and overdoing it isn't good.  
It's okay to take a small break."

Lila stares at the bread and pumpkin for a while, then says,

"W-well, refusing would… b-be bad."

She nods with lustful eyes.

And so, after parting with Lila, she returns to the mansion.  
Elvena was just feeding Gururun in the garden.

"Welcome back. How was it?"

"Ehehe, Krische’s thinking of having Lila's favorite meat skewers
tomorrow."

"Is that so?  
Fufu, that's wonderful."

"Yes, thanks to Elvena."

Elvena smiles happily and pats Krische's head.

Krische is the deputy head servant, but Elvena is quite something. While
she doesn't match Krische or Berry in terms of ability, Krische marvels
at her ability to understand people's feelings and subtly take care of
them.

"Did you know about Lila's pumpkin and prepare it?"

"Of course not.  
Krische-sama and the others seemed so happy, so I just…"

Elvena says with a smile, and Krische nods.

"Either way, it's thanks to Elvena.  
Krische thinks Lila has been depriving herself a bit too much, even if
it's for the sake of delicious food.  
And Krische thinks that Elvena's worry and consideration are conveyed to
Lila."

"Is that so… I sometimes worry that I'm getting in the way."

"It's alright. Sincerity and kindness are always conveyed eventually."

Quoting Berry's sayings, Krische nods repeatedly.  
Elvena is a bit mischievous, but a kind and considerate person.

"Ability is just a bonus" (from Berry's sayings), the way of a servant
is not about what they did, but what they thought when they did it.
Observing others well, showing subtle care, and giving small happiness
to others – that is the root of being a servant, and Elvena understands
this well.

Even if unintentional, her actions may have been an unconscious act of
care for Lila.  
Elvena usually denies such things, but it's probably humility.  
Not boasting about one's achievements is also part of being a servant.  
Such things only need to be understood by those who understand.  
Without dwelling on it, Krische says,

"You can rest when you're done taking care of Gururun, Elvena."

"Yes.  
Oh… that's right."

"…? "

As if remembering something, Elvena shows her a pot on the shelf in
Gururun's shed.  
Krische tilts her head, opens the lid, and the smell of alcohol wafts
out.

"…Is that alcohol?"

"Yes.  
I think it's something like monkey wine…"

"Monkey wine…"

It's said to be alcohol that is made naturally when animals store fruit
and other things.  
But that's just a convenient explanation.  
In most cases, it's just a hidden stash of alcohol, or alcohol made
secretly under that guise, is the common view.

"It seems the spirits near the farm saw Krische-sama and the others
making wine and tried to imitate it.  
More than monkey wine… it seems they were enjoying making alcohol in the
forest."

"Krische understands…"

Spirits are truly silly creatures.  
They're like Kreschenta when she's not thinking, living without deep
thought in the moment.  
There's nothing strange about them gathering fruit from the field and
making alcohol on their own.

"So I thought I should get Krische-sama's confirmation."

"C-confirmation…"

"Yes, confirmation."

Elvena says with a smile, and Krische's eyes dart around.

"B-but, Elvena, Selene has been raging about the alcohol ban lately…"

"Of course, I understand.  
If you say it should be returned, I was thinking of doing so, but I
thought I should get Krische-sama's judgment first…"

"Krische sees…"

Inhaling the smell of alcohol, Krische looks inside the pot.  
The impurities have been removed, and it's clear—it looks like it can be
drunk as is.

"I took a small sip, and it's quite a smooth and good drink."

"Smooth…"

"Yes.  
Of course, I'm not recommending drinking it, but I thought you should at
least check it, so I brought it… should I return it?"

Krische shakes her head in a panic when Elvena asks.

"Th-that's… n-no, it's not like that.  
Y-yes, confirmation is important."

"Understood. You'll probably be taking a bath soon, shall I leave it in
your room?"

"Y-yes…  
as the head servant, I also need to get Berry's confirmation."

"Yes, yes. …Between you and me, there are actually other alcohols I'd
like you to confirm."

Elvena leans in to whisper.

"The spirits seem to be making alcohol in several groups. Each is
different… if Krische-sama wishes, I can bring them to you at a later
date for confirmation."

"Later…"

"Yes. Anytime."

Elvena smiles, bows, and leaves.  
Krische, her cheeks flushed from the alcohol, looks at Gururun.

"T-this is… important confirmation, important work for a servant."

Whether Gururun understands or not, Krische mutters.  
Gururun makes a disinterested reply, "Gururu," and yawns.

Bathing is a very important daily routine for Krische.  
Waking up early in the morning, putting on her apron dress, she works
without a moment's rest, removing the fatigue so it doesn't linger into
the next day – an important time of rest.  
This is true for Krische, but even more so for Berry.  
Krische, though still immature, always relies on Berry, who always
pampers her.  
It's a precious time to repay Berry, who never falters as a servant.

"It's presumptuous of you to wash my hair, you redhead."

"Fufu, I apologize."

Even the sloppy Kreschenta, usually lounging around, cooperates this
time, muttering and grumbling as always, but washing meticulously. "They
can do it if they put their minds to it" is something Krische often
heard at Mia's dojo. Kreschenta truly embodies this.  
Her actions of washing Berry's hair with lather are impeccable.

If Kreschenta washes Berry's hair, Krische washes her body.  
Lathering it thoroughly, like caressing silk.  
Cleaning with utmost care from her fingertips, meticulously.

Every time she touches her, Krische thinks that Berry's body is so
pleasant to the touch.  
Firm yet soft and bouncy, yielding gently to the touch. A suppleness
possessed only by those who use no unnecessary force.  
Kreschenta – and Krische herself, probably – has a modest chest and
hips. Unlike Krische, who is not very well-built, Berry is big all
over.  
If compared to a chicken, it's the difference between a wing and a
thigh.

Krische doesn't dislike wings, but her favorite is still the juicy,
meaty thigh, something she wants to bite into. Berry's body is like a
thigh, possessing all the qualities Krische seeks.  
Kreschenta seems to agree, as she loves hugging Berry.  
Being able to become the ultimate cushion is a quality of a first-rate
servant.

And it's not just about body build, Berry's hugging style is also
excellent.  
When hugged, she's guided naturally to a comfortable position, and her
center of gravity is stable.  
The feeling is so comfortable that she could fall asleep easily.  
She adjusts subtly to any movement, making the hug comfortable even if
the position is a little awkward for the hugger.

Admirable service spirit.  
However, such small accumulations of fatigue add up.  
In this bath, Krische serves to undo Berry's mental apron dress – that
is the duty of the deputy head servant.

"Heehee, does it feel good?"

"Y-yes, very..."

Krische loves being washed by Berry and finds it very comfortable, but
Berry seems to dislike it somewhat, always making a slightly embarrassed
face.  
Krische tried various methods, wondering if the washing technique was
the problem, but that wasn't it; Berry is a lady even in such
situations. She's shy about showing her skin; a shy Ojou-sama.

Excellent touch, excellent cushioning, supple yet resilient—a body
naturally suited for service.  
For Krische, there's nothing shameful about Berry's naked body, but her
shyness probably stems from the idea that a lady shouldn't show her
skin.  
It's strange that she sometimes isn't shy; Krische theorizes the
difference lies in whether or not she's mentally wearing an apron dress.

Berry is a servant, and a servant is Berry.  
Berry is so devoted to service. In her daily life, from waking to
sleeping, Berry lives as a servant. Even naked, she's a servant, and the
situation of being served makes her uneasy.

She even feels shame at being served—such a servant's spirit. It's
admirable, truly impressive—Krische respects Berry.  
However, that's not right. As the saying goes, "Even Berry needs rest"
(quoted from Berry's sayings), Berry needs time to take off her mental
apron dress and rest. And Krische's most important role is to serve
Berry in that regard.

Krische covered Berry's entire body in bubbles, straddled her knees, and
gazed intently at her. Berry avoided eye contact. Krische kissed her
three times. Berry's body tensed slightly, then she gently pushed
Krische away.

In her eyes was a hint of anger, of reproach.  
Beyond the apron dress's metaphorical belt, naked Berry's face peeked
out, then quickly vanished.

"I-I can finish washing myself, it's alright."

At those words, her gaze flickering, Krische smiled and nodded in
agreement.

Berry said that Selene and Kreschenta are similar.  
Not just in their ways of being spoiled, but also in their clear
expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.  
Unlike Kreschenta, whose thoughts Krische can understand easily due to
their similar way of thinking, it's not as easy to know what Selene is
thinking, but Selene is still relatively easy to read.  
Her emotions are clearly displayed on her face.

Berry, on the other hand, is the opposite.

Anne and Lila are more like Selene; Elvena is a bit more like Berry.  
There's a slight pause before their emotions show on their faces.  
This isn't always the case, but Krische thinks their thought processes
are a bit different.

If Selene is clear soup, Berry is like a pie-covered, invisible soup.  
Covered in a fragrant pie crust, its contents are hidden, only the
outside is visible.  
You might think it's onion soup, but it could be a gratin; you can't
imagine what it is until you cut it open.  
All you know is that it's delicious.

A pie crust that would easily crumble with a spoon always covers Berry.

When she soaks in the bath and leans against Berry, she's enveloped in
support.  
Sometimes, however, Berry gently pushes Krische away. Berry is the
adult, Krische the child. Berry is always one step ahead.

Of course, Krische finds Berry beautiful, but Berry is a servant. Even
if it's true for everyone else, taking care of Berry is Krische's job.  
Krische wants to be spoiled by Berry, just as she spoils Berry.

After leaving the bathroom and changing into pajamas, Krische called out
to Anne and went to the kitchen.  
Elvena had already taken the cookies prepared for Selene.  
After taking the cookies to their room, Berry and Kreschenta immediately
noticed the jar on the shelf.  
Where the wine for nightcaps usually sits (currently under Selene's
management), the jar sat proudly.

"That is..."

"...it faintly smells of alcohol."

"That's right. This is..."

Krische explained what Elvena had just told her, placing it on the
table. Kreschenta placed the wine glasses, likely brought by Elvena,
next to it. Berry blushed, sighing as she looked at Krische and
Kreschenta.

"...Oh dear.  
We'll be scolded by the ojou-sama again?"

"Heehee, but it was made by a spirit, and I think we should check it."

"I think Elvena probably had it made, though."

"...? Is that so?"

"There's no proof...but she's mischievous, like a spirit."

Berry chuckled, sat on the sofa, and poured the contents of the jar into
the wine glasses.  
Thanks to magic, it glowed faintly amber.

"...Beautiful."

Berry murmured. Krische smiled, looking at Berry's profile.

"I thought it would be difficult to make them do complex things, but
they're surprisingly capable."

"Spirits are more intelligent now than when they first appeared. Even if
clumsy, they can use magic, and with a little training, they can
probably do tasks like this."

"Fufu, let's try various things next time."

Berry said, placing a wine glass in front of each of them.  
They clinked glasses, tasted it, and then drank.

It was as refreshing and easy to drink as she said. The alcohol content
was low, like juice.  
Unlike Krische and the others, whose work is mostly manual aside from
temperature control, it was likely brewed using magic. The sweetness and
sourness of various fruits blended together and flowed smoothly down
their throats.

"It's an easy-drinking alcohol. It seems like something Krische-sama and
the others would like."

"Yes! It's incredibly delicious!"

As Krische reached for the jar, Berry quickly moved it away.

"No. It's officially forbidden... today is just a taste test."

"...Is that so?"

"E-even with that look..."

When Krische stared intently at her, Berry avoided eye contact.  
Krische glanced at Kreschenta, who, upon understanding, snatched the jar
and poured herself some.

"What do you think you're doing, a mere servant? Berry, the master of
this place isn't Selene-sama, but the great queen who created this
world, myself and my onee-sama.  
If the master wants to drink, it's the duty of a subject to provide it."

"I think it's also the duty of a subject to advise a master who is about
to go down a bad path..."

Berry laughed in a troubled way, Kreschenta thrusting the jar at her.

"Unfortunately, I don't need the words of incompetent people like you.
I'd rather hear the caw of a crow. ...Can't the master drink?"

"...Oh dear."

She tilted her glass, drained the amber liquid, and let out a breath
with heated passion.  
Then she held out her glass, and Kreschenta cheerfully poured her more.

"Don't blame me if we get scolded."

"I have no reason to be scolded."

"Well..."

They said that, chuckling. Krische also held out her glass to be filled.

"...Krische-sama, you're a bad girl too."

Berry whispered in her ear, a tone that made Krische's heart pound.
Krische blushed slightly and quietly replied, "Yes."

Berry's voice, sweet yet prickly.  
A faint scent of honey mingled with alcohol, a strange fragrance.  
Deep within the crumbled pie, a Berry who wasn't a servant peeked out
just slightly.

Kreschenta and Krische took turns pouring the alcohol; Berry’s cheeks
were lightly flushed.  
While Krische and Kreschenta weren't strong drinkers, Berry was quite
capable. They poured just the right amount, initially scolding each
other, but eventually that stopped.

Berry's gaze would occasionally turn towards them, full of reproach.
Angry, light brown eyes. A gaze like a fiery sunset, burning Krische's
face. The colour of bubbling emotions within her usually hidden self.

Berry is always the adult, always the servant. Unlike Selene, she
doesn't get angry or reproach—she only expresses joy and pleasure.

But as Berry once said, everyone is human.  
She has a heart's soup, made with the same ingredients as everyone else,
she just doesn’t show it. She just endures until it overflows.

Berry is always a servant. Someone who doesn’t spend time on herself.  
That’s why Krische uses her time to serve her.

Like crumbling a pie with a spoon and stirring the soup inside. Making
the unangry Berry angry; being a bad girl is Krische's job.

They kissed, taking turns with her sister, exchanging bad kisses.  
Tasting and savoring the wine on their tongues, when Berry pinched
Krische's cheeks and pulled away.

"It's Krische-sama's fault."

To those words, Krische replied, "Yes."  
Hearing Berry's childish excuse, she smiled.

"...Heehee, it's Krische's fault."

Krische replied as usual.

Berry's most cunning trait is giving Krische an excuse to lose. Berry's
most kind trait is giving in even if Krische loses.

In the end, Berry always gives in and pretends to be angry at the
foolish Krische.  
She closes the distance from her position one step ahead, coming to the
same place.

Berry pushed Krische down on the sofa and said in an angry tone,

"For a bad Krische-sama, I must give you punishment."

Krische laughed at those words, remembering Selene at noon.

"...?"

"Selene said something similar at noon."

Berry blushed even more, sighing.

"Don't say things like that."

She kissed Krische, scolding her.

And so, at nightfall.  
Today, tomorrow, and the day after, Krische is an immature servant.  
Spoiled and unable to catch up, she goes round and round in the same
place, repeating the same things.  
In the mansion Berry painted, she clings to Berry day after day,
receiving everything.  
Berry says it's alright, and always spoils Krische.

"When did Krische-sama become such a bad girl?"

That's why, in the familiar world Berry painted, Krische tugs on her
sleeve and is selfish.  
She troubles and angers the kind Berry, and at night, she takes off the
world's best apron dress.

"I've always been a bad girl."

The Krische Krische desires is that Krische.

"...The Krische now is the Krische Berry and Krische found."

The Krische Berry desired, that Krische.

A slightly cunning and bad girl, that Krische will always be Krische's
Krische.
