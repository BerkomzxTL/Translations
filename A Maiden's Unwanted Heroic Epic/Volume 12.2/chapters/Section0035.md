# Chapter 345 - Charm 4

Roland should be thanked for continuing to lie until my father's last
moments.  
Thanks to him, Father could depart with a little bit of hope. He was a
man of low character, and he likely had no affection for my father.  
He must have been inwardly mocking him, but he never showed it in front
of Father.

For better or worse, Roland is a businessman; he doesn't do anything
that doesn't make money. If it makes money, he will fawn and grovel
without hesitation.  
Whatever it may be, he will use everything else as a means to an end.  
Lazura thinks there is something to learn from that way of thinking.

Roland's lodgings are magnificent. Northwest of Garugain, it's the
largest inn in Selkut, where Lazura and her family lived, and is used
for secret meetings and rendezvous by nobles and the wealthy.  
Even the innkeeper and others didn't say anything even after realizing
Lazura was a noble.

"Rest assured. As you can see, I have already paid off the debt, and of
course, I don't intend to charge any interest. However, the debt due to
the soaring price of magic crystals is difficult to deal with... Even
though I will take over the contract, it's a significant loss. Even with
our history with your father, accepting this out of goodwill would mean
I'd have to hang myself."

Lazura quietly looks at various documents detailing the Argan family's
assets and information, along with proof of the debt.  
Regarding the magic crystal contract, Roland has taken over in place of
the Argan family. The estimated loss if the contract is taken over is
included in the debt.  
Even if they sold the mansion and its heirlooms, it wouldn't be enough
to cover it.

However, simply considering the numbers, it's not exorbitant; it's
rather reasonable, even a little cheap, and could be considered
conscientious.  
I can mostly guess.  
In short, the difference is Lazura and Berry's price.

Roland was originally scheming to dismantle the Argan family.  
He likely did a lot of behind-the-scenes maneuvering to minimize his own
losses, or perhaps there were almost no losses to begin with, but it's
pointless to consider how much profit he made.  
My father lost in business, and Roland won. That's all there is to it,
and that win or loss cannot be overturned.

Closing her eyes, she relaxes her shoulders.

"I'm prepared, Roland.  
Holding the debt, facing a young woman who has lost her father...  
By now, there's nothing to fear, is there? Feel free to be blunt."

"As expected of the intelligent Lazura-sama... You're quick to the
point. And you have remarkable resolve."

He exaggeratedly spread his arms wide, a beast-like smile. He looked at
Lazura triumphantly, condescendingly, reveling in his victory.

"I sincerely admire that, not sarcastically... Where will my sale be?  
Isn't it already decided?"

"Yes, there are plenty of candidates.  
Regarding Berry-sama, several people have expressed interest in taking
her in... Of course, I have informed them of her age and circumstances,
but some still want to take her."

Lazura furrows her brow.  
Roland deepened his smile without concealing his malice.

"I expected you to react like that.  
While Lazura-sama is fine, Berry-sama's age is a significant factor...
Whether she'll find a suitable partner is largely a matter of luck. Of
course, I intend to carefully examine her potential suitors... but the
world is a frightening place. Some people have horrifying hobbies that
can't be expressed, while appearing as benevolent good people."

He laughs at Lazura's involuntary clenching of her fist.  
Knowing her resolve, Roland was mocking her.

"If you have any human compassion, could you grant me one wish?"

"Of course, I feel sorry for you too. For the daughter of the honorable
Baron Argan to meet such an unfortunate end..."

It's impressive how he can say that.  
Suppressing her anger, she bows her head quietly.

"I don't care what happens to me. No matter who my partner is, no matter
what I suffer, even if I'm killed, I won't complain. ...But please,
somehow help that child."

"I'm in a difficult position.  
With Lazura-sama bowing her head like this, I'm at a loss for words."

With a hint of laughter, Roland says:

"How about this? How about you two attend a gathering in the capital?"

"...A gathering?"

"Yes, please look up."

Roland looked at Lazura joyfully.

"It's a gathering of the wealthiest in the capital...  
various events, from balls to other functions.  
Lazura-sama can find a partner for herself there."

"...Berry too?"

"Yes, perhaps... there's a chance you might both meet someone kind
enough to take you both in.  
It would depend on negotiations with that person... but if you can judge
the person yourself, Lazura-sama would be more satisfied."

It wouldn't be a good gathering. A place where people like Roland
gather.

"As you think, it's a shady place...  
If you tell them beforehand, it's like a brothel where daughters of
nobles and merchants with various circumstances are gathered. However,
with Lazura-sama's beauty and intelligence, there will surely be those
who want to buy your freedom even at the cost of paying your debts."

"...You mean to make me a prostitute."

"Yes. Of course, Lazura-sama is already highly sought-after. Her beauty
is well-known in the north, so if you resist—"

"No, that's fine. Take me there."

There was no need to think. Even as a prostitute, it would be quite
high-class. There are countless impoverished people who sell themselves
to avoid starvation.

"As expected of Lazura-sama... I'm deeply moved. If, by any chance,
Berry-sama doesn't find a taker, I'll consider paying for her myself.
Rest assured, my tastes are quite normal in that regard."

"...!"

"If she gets healthy, she'll grow just as beautiful as Lazura-sama."

He mocked everything about Lazura's resolve. But there was no point in
shouting abuse.

"...Well, I need to know Lazura-sama well before introducing her to
those high-ranking individuals. I would like to see your body... and I
must teach you various bedroom manners to avoid any faux pas."

Furthermore, she hadn't lost everything.  
Her name remained, and she had someone to protect. As long as that was
the case, as long as she believed that, she could grovel and lick boots
without sullying her dignity as a noble.

"...Yes. Please, to your heart's content."

Speaking, she stood up and looked at the bed.  
She had been prepared since before she was called. She wasn't shaken.  
Just to be exposed and embraced.  
That's all it came down to.

She would simply remain dignified, worthy of her name.  
There was no need to lament.

After sunset, when she returned to the mansion, the servants' faces were
filled with concern and pity. She smiled, saying that her marriage had
been decided and thanked them, then went to Berry's room.

"...Nee-san"

"You're still awake?"

The room's window was open, and the air was chilly. It was the same when
she left. She probably looked out the window. While Lazura was gone.  
Her face seemed to already know what Lazura had done.

Lazura gently strokes Berry's head, which is slightly bowed. Then she
considers what to say.

A kind lie wouldn't even be kindness.

"Next week, you and I will go to the capital in Roland's carriage. ...To
put it bluntly, we're sisters who will be sold into slavery."

In her usual tone, as usual.  
She decided to tell her like that.

"We just had bad luck, but it's not a bad thing. Compared to those who
have to sell their bodies for bread, this is incredibly fortunate. Your
nee-san is the most beautiful woman in the world, and you are clever.
We'll skillfully find wealthy partners to buy us and live comfortably
together afterwards."

Berry listens silently. She probably isn't thinking about her future at
all.

"Don't worry. I'll take care of you—"

"...Nee-san"

She's thinking about Lazura.

"Please don't worry about me. ...Wouldn't nee-san have suitors even if
she didn't sell herself in such a place?"

Her sister was the wisest. Lazura hesitates again, smiles wryly, and
nods.

"...Yes, maybe."

"Then, please do that. I don't want to see nee-san..."

Berry lifts her face, placing her hand on Lazura's cheek.  
She looks straight at Lazura, honestly, earnestly, with light brown
eyes.

"...Please don't make nee-san any more unhappy."

Touching the trembling small hand, Lazura closes her eyes.  
She's so glad to have such a sister.

"I'm happy to have you, Berry. I'm still happy because you're here."

"That's—"

"—I can't walk without you."

Pressing her cheek against her hand, she smiles quietly.  
Lazura is still a child, not an adult. Or perhaps, even as an adult, she
will always be like this.

She isn't strong enough to stand alone without anything to protect.  
There's someone who cares about her more than herself. It is this happy
reality that allows Lazura to stand firmly on her two feet.

"What you said isn't wrong. It'll probably be easy.  
But for me, it's not something I can even consider. ...Most of all, I
can't forgive myself for such happiness."

She strokes Berry's cheek, as if holding back tears.

"I swore this name before Father. I said I'd take care of everything
after. But it's not a sense of responsibility or duty.  
I chose the way of life I believe in, a life where I wouldn't be ashamed
of myself..."

Then she laughed.

"I guarantee it. We'll suffer hardships and pain. ...But if you
acknowledge me as a noblewoman, please let me keep my vow."

Berry distorts her face, clenching her fists with her eyes downcast.  
Lazura hugs her small body and burrows into the bed.

"...Even if we lose everything, a noble keeps their name. That's how I
want to live. ...But even this haughty sister is still a child. I can't
live like that alone."

No matter what happens to her, she won't tarnish her name. It's easy to
say. But humans are weak and fragile, and their hearts change. Lazura
doesn't believe that she can keep her vow.

"That's why I need you. ...Do you understand?"

She holds Berry's cheeks in both hands, wiping away the tears with her
fingers.  
Berry's large light brown eyes are directed at Lazura.  
The tears that fall, simply and earnestly thinking of Lazura, are the
most beautiful in the world.

She doesn't think she can keep her vow, no matter what happens to her,
to keep her name untarnished.

But for this girl who sheds such beautiful tears, she feels she can do
it.

"As long as nee-san... needs me..."

Berry probably accepted those strong words more than Lazura thought.  
The self she cursed more than anyone else is being protected and kept
alive.  
What she saw in her eyes was love—and deep hatred, she thought.

In return, Berry continued, saying:

"...Will you stay with me forever?"

A childishly dependent plea. A word from a girl who doesn't allow
herself such things; a girl who wanted nothing, who spoke her first and
last selfish wish.  
It could easily be dismissed.

"...Of course, as long as you wish it."

That question was probably a contract. What kind of future did Berry
envision in a situation that even Lazura felt pessimistic about?

Leaning against Lazura, pressing her face against her chest, as if
relieved. A contract to fall together into the deep abyss.  
To share life and death—for Berry, it was a heavier word than a vow of
suicide, she thought.

The love of a girl who didn't even wish to live was deeper and heavier
than anyone's, binding her. It was a desperate love, like immersion.

The following week, they rode in Roland's carriage to the capital.  
The long-serving servants who stayed until the end saw them off with
tears. That's why Lazura smiled and bid farewell.

The environment will worsen. She will probably receive cruel treatment.
But that's all. If there's someone who worries about her, there's no
need for her to worry.

She may be disconcerted by the sudden change, but people get used to
things eventually. And, though not as much as her sister, she's quite
intelligent and beautiful. If she's going to be a prostitute, she might
as well aim for the top and enjoy it. Lazura thinks she'll find a thing
or two to enjoy in any place.

During the journey, her sister was obedient. She ate all her meals, even
if she had to force herself, and rested properly.  
Sometimes she would lie down with Lazura's lap as a pillow, snuggling up
to her.

Lazura knows why she does this, and it's all the more precious.

"Look, Berry. There's the Twin Mountains."

Whether she's awake or asleep, Berry quietly gazes out the window,
holding Lazura's arm.  
Two mountains towering side by side.  
It had been a long time since she had entered the capital region. Before
Berry was born, when she was a child, she was held by her stepmother in
a carriage—was it to attend some kind of banquet?  
She doesn't remember much, but she remembers the scenery.

Lazura, excited about her first long trip, and her stepmother, smiling
kindly. When Lazura said there were two mountains, her stepmother said,
"Twin Mountains."  
With such a little memory of a trip.

"Once we pass that, we'll be in the capital region... the climate gets a
little warmer, so Berry might find it easier to live in.  
But it's a bit bumpy when we pass them, so try not to get carsick."

"...Yes, nee-san."

"They're called that because they're like twins. That's right,
originally, they were one mountain..."

"According to the book's legends, an ancient dragon split it into two."

"Yes, that's right."

Lazura nods, pointing with her finger.

"It was one, then became two...  
Even if they're not twins, sisters are similar.  
Let's call the slightly taller one Lazura Mountain."

"...It's Mitskronia."

"Don't interrupt so calmly. Your nee-san can call whatever she wants.
The smaller one will be Berry Mountain."

Lazura laughed and put Berry on her lap.

"Fufu... Sisters are like halves.  
Just as you envy me, I envy you... yet we are just together. It's
sometimes cruel, yet happy."

Someone who is always by her side, showing her many things. Berry and
Lazura were mirror images, opposite in many ways.  
Their personalities, their talents, many things were different. But
strangely, they had something in common, and Lazura couldn't think of
her as a stranger.

"I'm not perfect, but I feel perfect as long as you're here.  
As your sister, I'm invincible."

—So, just be by my side.

Berry didn't answer Lazura's words, and pressed her face against her.
Berry would take it as concern. As an insult to her determination to
even face death. But it was Lazura's true feelings.

With a weak heart that longs to simply live yet feels like giving up on
everything. Choosing ease is always simple, and the body feels light as
if floating. Only the clinging weight of my sister's all-consuming
love—pushed both my feet onto the unsteady ground.

"I love you, Berry."

Gently stroking, Lazura closes her eyes as well, feeling her sister's
weight.

The carriage journey continues silently. Upon reaching the capital, they
were assigned a single room in a first-class district inn. While the
dress was being made, Lazura, accompanied by Roland, attended various
banquets and exchanged greetings.  
It felt like a new product introduction.

Once the dress was finished, they visited a large mansion. The evening
gown, made of a sheer fabric, was almost like underwear. It was barely
decent enough for a high-class courtesan, but ultimately still a vulgar
dress.  
For my sister, it was her first dress—I regretted not forcing her to
wear hand-me-downs back at the mansion.  
Whenever she hears the word "dress," she'll surely recall this moment.

"——Oh… truly beautiful.  
You two suit each other well."

Roland laughed cheerfully at the sight, but Lazura greeted him with a
cold gaze. Berry glared at him with hatred.

"Berry-sama, you mustn't make such a face.  
It's understandable that you hate me… I don't mind that, but it would
trouble Lazura-sama if you were impolite to others. I'm not saying you
have to smile, but please don't make that face outside."

"……Yes."

Putting a hand on Berry's shoulder, she sighed.

"It's refreshing wearing a dress I wouldn't wear myself. Thank you for
the lovely dress. If it's a gift, I'd be happy if you'd give me a few
more… one dress is too difficult to manage."

Roland nodded admiringly.

"Ideally, I'd like you to buy them yourself… but since it's
Lazura-sama's wish.  
While they won't be newly tailored, I'll select a few older ones and
have them remade."

"Oh, it pays to ask."

"……Most young ladies brought here like this either wallow in sorrow,
cower and flatter, or become reckless… that's usually the case.  
Someone like Lazura-sama, who can calmly accept reality and look ahead,
is rare. …It's dazzling to someone lowly like myself."

He was a man who mocked and looked down on the nobility. However, I
think that was once simply envy and jealousy.  
A trace of his true feelings seemed mixed in his self-deprecating words.

"Oh, flattery is nice too."

"……No, it's the truth."

He was petty, base, and the worst kind of man.  
But that's only from Lazura's perspective.  
For a man to reach this position, he must have endured hardships and
humiliations unknown to Lazura, who was born a noble.  
To a man who had nothing, a noble raised in the sun would undoubtedly be
an object of hatred.

I hate him, and naturally, I want to kill him. But I understand him
enough to feel that we're in the same boat, and even pity him.

I think this man would even lick someone's shoes if it benefited him.
But no one willingly chooses that. It's undoubtedly unpleasant; he's
merely used to it, because he's spent his days doing so until he became
accustomed.

It's easy to look down on him as trash without decency or pride, but
that isn't the right way to see things, as my father once said. You
won't gain anything unless you try to learn. At least this man was
someone Lazura should learn from.

"I am a merchant… I believe my judgment is sound. Goods and people,
everything in this world is a mixture of good and bad… I've lived by
discerning their value.  
Because I believe Lazura-sama has the worth to do so, I will continue to
do so… that is not out of sentiment or flattery, but the principle of a
merchant."

With exaggerated gestures like an actor, Roland bowed, looking like a
ridiculous, laughable clown mocking everything.

"To be honest, I'd hate to let you go… but I don't want things like that
by my side. As you know, I'm a lowly person."

Lazura smiled and said,

"You seem likely to live a long life, Roland… as long as your eyes don't
cloud over."

"Thank you for your advice. I will take it to heart."

It was meant as sincere praise. Otherwise, I wouldn't understand why my
father died.

After that, she attended more gatherings with Roland.  
They were somewhat vulgar spectacles, but nothing more.  
She participated normally, exchanged greetings, and if she was liked,
she would go to a separate room and sell flowers. Or later, at an inn
somewhere.

She doesn't think it's pathetic. She had the freedom to choose her
partners, and sometimes she was given gold coins for carriage fare.
There were many who were willing to pay, and as a flower seller, she was
considered high-class.  
Once she discarded girlish dreams of finding true love or sacred
rituals, the acts were acts and the work was work.  
It was nothing special.

Berry always accompanied Lazura. She would wait quietly outside the room
until Lazura finished her work and appeared.  
At first, Lazura told her to go home, but soon gave up.  
Many were interested in the little girl, and leaving her alone was
worrisome.  
If allowed, she thought her sister would choose this.

Every time they met after work, Berry's large light brown eyes looked up
at Lazura.  
As if worrying about Lazura, grieving—or perhaps hating.  
Waiting for Lazura to break and need her.

She thinks that Lazura remaining pure is what her sister can't stand the
most.  
Accompanying Lazura like this is a form of self-harm.

Eyes with a dark expectation of wanting to fall together. The twilight
color at the edge of night was terrifyingly beautiful, twining and
clinging. If Lazura wished, she'd surely follow anywhere.  
To the deepest bottom of the dark abyss, filled with gloomy reassurance.

Those words were probably a contract of sorts.  
That's why my sister cultivates a hatred-like love each day.

"Unfortunately, it seems they didn't buy us again. They have no taste."

"……Is that so?"

That's why Lazura always smiled at Berry. Even if she lost at something,
she couldn't afford to lose to her sister in a battle of wills.

"Ugh, my stomach is empty now that I'm angry. Let's go home, Berry."

"……Yes, nee-san."
