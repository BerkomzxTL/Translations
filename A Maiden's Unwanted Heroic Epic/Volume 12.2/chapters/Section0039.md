# Chapter 349 - Charm End

Left alone, she would roll to the edge of the bed.  
Once she learned to crawl, she would crawl all over the room, and once
she started walking, she would cautiously try to descend the stairs.  
Selene, who would wake up unexpectedly and start acting even after I
thought I had finally put her to sleep, was a child who required
constant supervision, not even a moment's respite.

For her younger sister, she was a sudden, immovable boulder in an
otherwise smooth existence. Even the usually composed Berry seemed quite
perplexed by Selene's erratic behavior.  
Housework was supplemented by the task of watching Selene, leading Berry
to make unusual, small mistakes for a while.  
Lazura laughed at this, while Berry sighed repeatedly.

It was the happy everyday life they had hoped for. But strangely, there
was a premonition, and just as the younger sister watched the older
sister, Lazura also watched Berry. It started the moment Selene was
born.  
Time seemed to stop; Berry's body, which had been growing so steadily,
stopped developing, leaving Lazura with an uneasy feeling.

It was said that the mind affects the body, and this effect was
especially strong among nobles who possessed a great deal of magical
power.  
It was akin to the saying, "Illness comes from the mind." Though there
was no concrete evidence, Lazura believed it when it came to her sister.

She loved selflessly, sometimes hated, and showered her with an intense,
clinging affection. The taciturn and quiet younger sister was controlled
by deeper emotions than anyone else. Her seemingly rational demeanor was
a mere counterweight to suppress those emotions.

Wishing for death caused her body to become ill, even rejecting growth.
Then, as if only to be useful to Lazura, she grew taller, showing signs
of blossoming.  
A magnificent flower that would have bloomed more beautifully than
Lazura, yet it stopped growing, remaining in bud form. She stood at the
boundary between child and adult, never surpassing her petite sister's
height, remaining in her shadow.

Even if Lazura broke their contract, Berry continued to uphold it.  
Perhaps it was because Lazura broke their contract that it became a
counterweight, something to be maintained.  
Many people lived normal lives, but Berry could not. No matter how
painful, she couldn't live her own life.

I think she intended to leave immediately after Selene's birth,
believing she was no longer needed by her happy sister. But she couldn't
leave Lazura and Selene, so she lingered.

Going to kill Roland was just an excuse, a reason to live she had
found.  
Even that wasn't for herself, but for Lazura.

Her beauty, intelligence, and talent—everyone envied her remarkable
abilities. Yet, to her sister, she had no value—perhaps she considered
Lazura someone who would cherish even a roadside pebble.

Compared to her infancy, Selene had become somewhat more sensible.
Lazura found herself with more leeway, and Berry as well.  
During this time, Lazura would frequently summon her sister, giving
orders while acting spoiled, leaning on her and hindering her progress;
but even these days had their limits.

Something about her expressions, her actions, her words; from such
things, something was felt.  
She noticed Berry had begun preparations to leave.  
That day, they were together in the kitchen—the twilight-colored jewels
melted into droplets.

Her sister's glittering tears were always sad and beautiful. "Don't
cry," I kissed her forehead, yet the tears flowed relentlessly.

"I know how self-deprecating you are.  
You probably keep thinking you're worthless, that you're only capable of
so little, right?"

Sometimes I thought she was mocking me—so self-deprecating was my
sister. Perhaps she didn't want to be noticed.  
She intended to leave one day secretly, cleanly, leaving behind a
letter.

But Lazura saw her sister far more than she thought, consciously
noticing her daily.

"It's true I may have what you lack, but you also have what I lack—you
are my other half."

I said it many times, but my words didn't get through. Berry didn't
understand how important she was to Lazura.  
She truly believed she was a pebble that could be easily discarded.

"You do the housework, cook the meals… I'd be lost without you."

As I embraced her, sobs escaped.

"Is it your wish to cause your beloved and cherished nee-san trouble?"

As I asked, she shook her head as expected. I had watched her, been by
her side all this time. Lazura had more confidence than this girl in
understanding Berry Argan.

Just as her sister had idolized and resented her, Lazura was also afraid
of Berry.

She was a sister who didn't smile, a sister whose thoughts were
incomprehensible.  
Children were supposed to cry and laugh. Initially, like the servants,
she kept her distance. Everyone had looked forward to Berry's birth,
celebrating, yet the moment she was born, she cast a shadow over the
house.  
It's true that somewhere in my heart, I thought she was strange.  
Just like the servants.

The daughter of my beloved stepmother, my own sister.  
I hated myself for feeling that way towards her, so I tried to
understand her, systematically dissecting my feelings, providing reasons
for them.

Many times I found her bothersome.  
I wasn't unaffected by her talent, which made me seem like a 'pebble' in
comparison. But Berry was a pitiful younger sister, a girl to be pitied.
By seeing her that way, by acting as someone who understood her, Lazura
could remain her older sister.

To be adored and loved by such a sister, to be that older sister—that
alone is what made Lazura who she is today.  
The special thing about Lazura, someone born into relative privilege,
was that this person was by her side.

"This is a precious encounter. I want you to appreciate it as I do, and
from now on, I want you to find your own happiness."

My stepmother passed away, my father as well; I've faced many
hardships.  
But even if the circumstances were different, I would undoubtedly still
be here.  
Half of Lazura is made up of Berry; it couldn't be filled by anything
else.  
No matter how happy I am, it feels incomplete without my sister's
happiness.

"You're the best sister in the world… I need you to be the happiest in
the world."

Lazura was greedy; she wanted more than her share, more than anyone
else.

"That way I'm happy, and Bogan too. Okay? If you're good with weapons,
then stop thinking foolish things and make some delicious food. Are you
seriously going to let my darling Selene eat my cooking?"

"If you say something like that, I'll get angry," I said, and Berry
laughed.

"… Nee-san's cooking… I couldn't possibly let her eat it."

"That's right! I need you to cook for me instead."

I was hugged tightly, and I hugged her back with equal force.  
The breasts of the two sisters, whose heights remained unchanged,
pressed together, melting, connecting until our hearts touched.  
The reason didn't matter; it could be anything. Just as Berry considered
me a kind older sister who treasures pebbles, I also considered her
peculiar.

A selfish and self-centered older sister, a foolish child who loves to
serve such a sister, a foolish child who readily dedicates even her life
to her sister… the most precious person in the world, the most
beautiful.

"I love you, Berry… so, will you promise me something?"

But the day when Lazura, the betrayer, would be able to fill her sister
with happiness would never come. I still wish for her to remain by my
side.  
How selfish and cruel is that desire?

"Until the day another happiness comes your way, stay by my side,
promise me that."

That was a spell, intended to let go of her sister someday.

"… Yes, sister."

Berry, who replied, harbored not a shred of expectation of any other
happiness. Yet, she didn't hesitate, answering Lazura as a younger
sister.

Pulling away, I stroked her cheek and gently traced her lips. As her
eyes always did, her lips spun words of magic.

"Fufun, I've got you! No taking back your words!"

"Yes… I swear by my name."

But no matter what my sister thought, this was a new contract we swore
to keep; a promise, a gamble.

If that day didn't come, it would be Lazura's loss.  
If that day did come, it would be Berry's loss.

And Lazura had never lost a real match with her sister.

In the atelier she had built herself, she hummed, gazing at the painting
she had created.  
A knock echoed.

"Ojou-sama, how about some tea as a break?"

"……"

Without answering, she remained silent, and the door opened, and someone
entered.  
There were two sets of footsteps, but even without seeing, she knew
there was one person and two animals.

"Krische-sama, the cookies are over there."

"Yes!"

"Kreschenta-sama, shall we brew some tea together?"

"…It's troublesome."

"Kreschenta-sama, no snacks for you."

Looking towards the entrance, she saw Kreschenta, being held by a
red-haired servant, pouting displeasure. Two feet stood awkwardly on the
ground.  
For this slovenly former queen, being carried was her usual mode of
transportation. It was rare for her to walk on two feet.

"…I didn't say you could come in. And bringing two fools with you,
what's the meaning of this?"

"Well, you're still sulking, aren't you?"

"I'm not sulking!"

When I glared, the red-haired servant chuckled.

Two days ago, a great match took place; a duel with swords, a contest of
honor.  
Having won through unimaginably underhanded tactics, she didn't show a
trace of remorse.  
What a truly unpleasant woman. What kind of upbringing could create such
a person?

However, although I complained a lot, a win was a win, a loss was a
loss. Besides,

'Our master often said that no matter how close the margin, how cowardly
the tactics, a loss is a loss, and the loser has no right to object. …A
wonderful teaching, fitting for a martial family.'

'So convenient for you! You were never a soldier to begin with! And now
I'm the master and you're just a servant!'

'But I am the tutor of the Christand family. I have been entrusted with
the education of the Ojou-sama more than the master and your sister…
Surely, ojou-sama, just because you've become the master, you don't
intend to scorn them—'

'That's what I'm saying is unfair! You really…’

I couldn't win in an argument. Berry Argan was unrivaled in sophistry.
It would have been different if Selene had won, but having lost and then
having her father's teachings used against her, there was nothing to
say.

"Don't worry. I won, you lost. That's all there is to it."

"You're so annoying…"

"A match depends on luck… if you dwell on one defeat, you won't grow."

"It's already piled up into a mountain—ugh"

"Shut up."

Kreschenta, who had put down her teacup in exasperation, declared, as
Selene pinched her cheek.  
Krische, who was sitting beside me, tilted her head with a carefree
expression and smiled.  
She must be seeing Selene as if she were having a fun chat with Berry.  
The way the two constantly talked about strange and unintelligible
things is how this sister perceives their interaction.

"Ugh…!?"

Selene felt inexplicably angry, so she pinched her cheek again.

"You shouldn't do that, it's childish."

"…I want to pinch your cheeks until they never return to normal."

"Ojou-sama, imagine yourself having lost a match and then resorting to
violence. Would that be something you could be proud of?"

"A-actually… ugh!"

"Ugh… fanihmafhuro…!"

"Phe, phelerere, ihyairefu…!"

My fingers, pinching their cheeks, tightened involuntarily, and I
sighed, expelling my anger.  
The two, their cheeks released, glared at Selene accusingly, then subtly
distanced themselves.

"…What, do you have a problem?"

"Ugh…"

"…I don't want to agree with what the red-haired one said, but what just
happened was clearly a tantrum."

"As Kreschenta said. Krische, it must have hurt."

"Ehehe… yes. But, if you pet it, the pain might go away."

Krische's cheeks were stroked, and she immediately became cheerful.
Kreschenta, with a disgruntled look, glanced at Berry, then snuggled
close and let me stroke her cheek.  
Selene sighed again.

"…So, what do you want?"

"I thought we'd decide where to go for the underwater submersion tour.
As I mentioned, according to Krische, there are many large magical
crystal caves in the Fasna Trench, so how about exploring them while
observing deep-sea creatures…"

"…Do whatever you want. You won, so don't be so considerate."

"Are you still sulking?"

"I'm not sulking!"

—And so, they ate cookies while talking about their trip.

The underwater submersion tour was, as the name suggests, a sightseeing
tour where you sink to the bottom of the sea.  
The unknown creatures that lurk in the depths where light cannot
reach.  
It was a tour whose main purpose was to observe the countless creatures
that haven't even been discovered on the other side of the world, to
experience the mysteries of life; it was especially one of Berry's
favorites.  
Elvena and Anne also seemed to enjoy it quite a bit.  
Whenever a new species is discovered, someone who won a ridiculous match
gave it a random name and recorded it in a field guide, observing its
behavior. The seabed was inherently rich in magical power; new creatures
were born and disappeared, and the seabed itself was vast.  
New species were discovered on every trip, leading to great excitement,
but still something didn't quite feel right.

A presentation of the magical crystal caves in the Fasna Trench, shown
through a magically projected image, would undoubtedly pique interest,
but the place she most wanted to go to was Creesian.  
Located on the opposite side of the Alberan Continent (as it's now
called) in the southeast of the Venasiere Continent, it is probably the
largest magical crystal cave on this planet.  
It was an artificial (or perhaps dragon-made) cave, diligently dug over
tens of thousands of years by the hole-digging dragon Venasil, who had
recently come to this area.  
The dragon had created vast mountain ranges with the excavated earth,
transforming the sea into land. The beauty of the magical crystals
spreading through the dragon's nest would surely be magnificent. Selene
wanted to explore this great cave created by a peculiar dragon (most
dragons are peculiar).  
Even if magical crystal caves were introduced to please her, she still
couldn't be genuinely happy.

She grumbled and ate cookies.  
By the time the full Krische and Kreschenta fell asleep on the sofa, her
anger had subsided somewhat, and she resumed painting.  
It was still in the sketching stage.

"I thought it was a self-portrait, but is it perhaps my sister?"

Berry, who had put the two to sleep, peeked over and asked.

"Yes. I thought I would put it up where you see it every day. If you see
my mother's face, it might help to straighten out your twisted mind, a
little bit anyway."

"Well. I don't think my personality is bad…"

"You're so twisted it's worse than bad, really."

Berry laughed, shaking her shoulders with amusement, and I sighed,
glaring at her.

"But it's been so long that I can't quite remember clearly."

"Kreschenta might remember accurately… She was with the master and
nee-san at the ceremony in the capital, so if she saw it even from afar,
she would probably draw it effortlessly."

"Maybe, but I don't want to ask that fool."

"How much do you remember?" I asked. She smiled, replying, "Quite a bit,
actually."  
I pursed my lips, and she continued, "Although it's faded, of course."

"I see my sister's living portrait every day," she said.

"...Are we really that much alike?"

"Yes.  
There are differences like hair color, eye color, and body
type...Ojou-sama is more slender than nee-san, and taller."

Saying this, she caressed Selene's cheek and turned her face towards
her.

"Her face is a little fuller, her ears are a little lower, and her
earlobes are a little thinner.  
Other than that, her eyes are just a little softer...Her nose and mouth
are exactly the same."

Her light brown eyes were enveloped by long eyelashes, as if
reminiscing.  
While saying this, she traced Selene’s lips with her thumb and gently,
softly kissed them.

Selene’s cheeks flushed involuntarily.  
Despite having a girlish face, Berry is sometimes overwhelmingly
alluring.

"Somehow...I really want to ask, but I don't want to ask, but..."

"...?"

"Actually, how were you and Mother?  
You know, a relationship beyond that of sisters...?"

"Ah...fufufu, I suppose it's a difficult question to ask from
ojou-sama's position."

Berry smiled slightly, looking a little troubled at the somewhat awkward
question.

Even as a child, Selene thought they were unusually close.  
Things like Berry letting Selene sleep on her lap, pulling her into bed
as a pillow, letting her sit on her lap, or sitting together.  
Considering Krische's personality, the closeness to Krische was
unavoidable, and in fact Selene couldn't criticize her either.  
Mother and Berry were sensible, good adults.  
While sometimes feeling jealous of their closeness, at the time Selene
didn't question it.  
But looking back on it as an adult, their closeness was unnatural.

Selene vaguely thought that's how sisters are, but even in that world,
Selene never saw sisters who were that close, even in old age.  
Of course, there might have been sisters like that who just didn't show
it, but their relationship was close enough to attract gossip.

A triangular relationship between Father, Mother, and Berry was entirely
plausible and not surprising.  
Of course, Father didn't say anything, and Selene saw him gazing at the
two of them with a smiling expression many times. He probably didn't
think it was a problem, but for Selene, who was on the outside, it was a
very delicate topic.

Did Father recognize them as close sisters? Or did he tacitly accept
their relationship?

It's a belated question—now that Selene has no need to keep secrets with
Berry.  
It's not that it matters, and Selene doesn't want to have unhealthy
fantasies like Anne's, but it's an indescribable topic that seems subtly
related to her birth.  
She wants to ask, but she doesn't want to ask—that's the kind of content
it is.

"It's difficult to put it into words.  
It may not be what you'd call an ordinary sisterly relationship, but in
a word, you could still call it a sisterly relationship...but it was
perhaps a closer relationship than that of sworn lovers, in a sense."

"...S-so"

"For me, therefore, I don't know how nee-san felt in her heart...But
rest assured.  
It wasn't a relationship where we shared our naked skin."

Gently tracing Selene's lips, Berry said,

"My sister was united with the head of the household, exchanging marital
love, and my sister and I exchanged sisterly love...That's the nature of
that love.  
It's simply a matter of form."

"Form..."

"Whether you pour water, plenty of honey, or even molten lead, a vase
remains a vase."

"...But you were probably molten lead, weren't you?"

Berry was that kind of person.  
A feeling too heavy and hot to pour into a vase.  
Somehow, that explains their relationship well.

"Fufu, perhaps.  
But now it's cooled and solidified, and it has the shape of a vase."

—Even if the vase breaks, eternally.  
Berry, announcing this, kissed Selene again.

Light yet heavy, like the temperature of human skin, burning hot.  
So soft that it would melt if pressed.

"Anyway, it's something from the past that can be enjoyed just by
looking at it. ...Besides, now there's someone generous enough to say
that I can pour as much lead as I like."

"...I didn't say that.  
Besides, you're the one who made that fool into a generous person, I was
listening properly."

"...My, my.  
Eavesdropping is something I inherited from my sister."

Chuckling and shaking her shoulders, she put her hand to her mouth.  
Like a girl, Berry laughed, then stroked Selene’s cheek again, and
gently leaned in again.  
Her touch and gaze were hot.

"U-um, it's still daytime, but..."

"It seems so."

Agreeing, without a hint of shame.

"...Really, what's going on in your head?"

Sighing, Selene blushed crimson, calling her a useless servant.

Then, they rubbed their noses together, one after the other.

Even a little bit, Lazura's feelings must have been conveyed.  
That was also a kind of contest.  
Lazura was watching Berry more than she thought.  
Lazura, who made her think so, won, and as always, her sister lost.

After losing the contest, Berry honestly spent time by Lazura’s side as
promised. She began to smile naturally not only at Lazura, but also at
her daughter Selene, and similarly in front of Bogan. The heavy stone of
emotion became a little lighter, and peering out, showing a faint color,
she turned her eyes to the outside world. She didn't change, it was just
like the time they were taking classes together.  
She must have taken a long detour and finally returned.

The atmosphere has become much softer, and even the townspeople say so
when they go shopping. Berry was originally a kind child. She was just
confined by her body and environment, and since infancy, she was
other-centered. Her sister, who suffered from a heart disease because
she didn't want to bother others, is a person who can rejoice in others'
joys as if they were her own. If things had been different—for example,
if she had maintained a good relationship with that old teacher, that
joy might have become her confidence, and she might have chosen a path
to help many people.

It's a little regrettable, but it's a hypothetical situation.  
Because of that twist of fate, Lazura was able to become this happy, so
it's enough just to dream about it.

Having been entrusted with Selene's education, she is happily troubled
every day.  
Because she was entrusted with her education, she made an effort to
interact with people normally.  
The sight of her trying to overcome her aversion by making small talk
with the shopkeepers, though a little nervous, is laughable.

That's about the only thing my sister has truly worked hard for.  
She can easily do things that others can't do without struggling, but
simple small talk and everyday conversations are a difficult problem for
her.  
With a serious expression, you'd think she was about to say something
important, but she would say, "It's a nice day today," and then her face
would turn red as the conversation would come to a halt.  
She was quite silly and cute.

However, sincere feelings are communicated.  
Various things were conveyed from that appearance, and the other party
wouldn't mind.  
Garugain is a peaceful town, and the people are kind.  
They treated my sister and my daughter well, so her tension eased, and
she became more natural, and Selene became that way too.

Children, an unknown existence.  
Perhaps because Selene was a very clever child herself, Berry, who had
been cautiously approaching children, seemed to have realized that
children are rather simple and silly, and she seemed relieved.  
She endlessly indulged her whims, smiling as she watched her sleeping
face.  
Selene also became very attached to Berry.

My sister, who easily solves various things, seems to enjoy worrying
about other people. The sight of her struggling to figure out how to
solve a problem for Selene, who is struggling with a simple problem, is
truly enjoyable, and I truly think I'm glad to be her older sister.  
Perhaps because she doesn't value her own talents, whether good or bad,
she looks down on others in a very natural way, like rejoicing at a baby
crawling or standing up.  
She must have been treated like a child her whole life, always being
praised with "Well done".

It was fine for Selene to be treated like that when she was a child, but
even children grow up.

"What are you sulking about?"

"...I'm not sulking."

With an expression that clearly said "I am sulking", eight-year-old
Selene sulked and rolled onto the sofa.  
Denying it while showing her displeasure.  
This is a model example of a silly child's sulking.  
A child so cute it hurts my heart.

"My, how cute...Perhaps Selene was born just to make her mother happy?"

"Mmph..."

"Ufufu, she's so cute that her mother would be saying 'kyaa kyaa'.  
'Kyaa kyaa'."

When I hugged her because she was so adorable, she blushed sullenly.  
It made her even more lovely.

The energetic child that Lazura wished for.  
A child who is excessively energetic, like Bogan.  
She inherited his blood so well, even to the point of swinging a sword
she doesn't even own, resembling him in areas she shouldn't.  
On top of that, she is stubborn and competitive.

Because she was such a child, Bogan began to teach her swordsmanship as
a game, thinking that he might as well let her swing a wooden sword, and
she swings a sword every day without getting bored.  
She got motivated, saying that she would succeed her father in the
future.  
Lazura thought she would get bored eventually, but unlike the fickle
Lazura, she took after Bogan in that respect.

Bogan said that she has talent, but even if she has talent or not, a
mother wouldn't want her child to go to the battlefield.  
While thinking it's good that she's motivated, I want her to look at
things other than the world of life and death.  
I instructed Berry, who sometimes deals with her in Bogan's stead, to
strictly teach her the reality of things—whether it was a good idea or
not.

An aunt who only learned a little swordsmanship from Bogan.  
Hearing only that, she seems to be a very easy opponent.  
Because of that, she has set her sights on the talented Berry as her
current goal, and things have gotten a little complicated.  
Once Selene sets her mind on something, she goes straight ahead. She is
a stubborn, hard-working person.  
Instead of giving up even after losing several times, she gets motivated
and boldly challenges.  
And Berry, without any malice, deals with the child.  
Rather than training, she praises the energetic child's swinging of the
stick.

Since I told her to teach her reality, I, Lazura, felt awkward watching
Berry add fuel to the fire.  
Because Selene, who I thought would give up eventually, was more
stubborn than I imagined, I had no choice but to watch the fire turn
into flames.

Even though she's a new recruit, Selene, who confidently challenges
adults after winning, then practices hard again, is truly Bogan's
child.  
Yesterday, she was full of confidence because she had won a point from
her instructor, and this morning she was making a fuss about practicing
later, but as always, while being praised as "Very good, very good," she
suffered a complete defeat and is sulking because of it.

"...I thought I could do it today."

"The world is surprisingly vast, Selene.  
It's okay, whether you're strong or weak with a sword."

"It's not okay.  
Berry doesn't practice at all..."

"My, you're angry.  
I told you before.  
There are many more important things than that.  
In this world...Okaa-san's recommendation is to spoil Berry a lot."

Putting Selene on her lap, she points a finger.

"I'm not as strong as that child, and I'm not good at studying, but
she'll do anything if I ask her to.  
Even if I have to fight with a sword, Berry will protect me, and she'll
usually take care of troublesome problems."

"...I want to become stronger and succeed my father, and protect Mother
and everyone."

"We're not gods, so we can't do everything by ourselves just because we
want to. Even gods have strengths and weaknesses."

Lazura laughs, "Silly girl."

"Even gods rely on each other for what they can't do.  
Don't you think it's even more so for weaker humans?  
Try your best within your capabilities, help each other when you're in
trouble, and have tea together peacefully—that's the best."

"...I don't care if I lose at everything else, but I really want to win
with a sword."

"Fufu, that's so childish.  
If Mother gets serious, she can beat that child no matter what she
fights her with."

"...Could Mother win even with a sword?"

"It would be a piece of cake. If I asked her to lose, Berry would lose."

Selene silently glares at Lazura.  
Lazura laughs, squashing her sullenly puffed cheeks with both hands.

"Perhaps Selene has a magical sure-win strategy that would easily defeat
Berry?"

"...Absolutely not.  
I want to win fairly and squarely."

"As long as you say that, you'll never beat Berry.  
Winning is what matters, and how you win is just a bonus, a bonus.  
Bogan says the same thing, doesn't he?"

"Otou-sama didn't say that much."

Chuckling, she strokes her head, shaking her shoulders.

"Selene may not understand yet, but there are battles in life that you
absolutely cannot afford to lose. Not limited to the battlefield, it's a
battle where you bet something much more important than your own life."

"...Does Okaa-sama have something like that?"

"Of course.  
For example, hoping Selene will grow up healthy and happy, or that
she'll have wonderful encounters."

Pressing her cheek against Selene's small head, she plays with her long
hair—her sister's long hair, which was cut off.  
The long hair Lazura made her cut off.

"That's why I will win the next battle too, and I will use anything and
everything to win without hesitation.  
...What really matters is not losing in truly important battles."

—Everything else doesn't matter, she closes her eyes.

Lazura was probably greedy.  
Thinking of making her already happy life even happier.

As Selene grew older, she became more competitive with her sister.
Lazura disliked the possibility of that turning into inferiority complex
or negative emotions, but it wasn’t a big problem. Even if she got
worked up, Selene loved Berry as before, and she was a sensible good
child. I thought it would be alright as long as I watched over her, but
I still pursued greater happiness.

It was a little difficult with Selene's time.  
So, I thought that Bogan and I would just try for a natural pregnancy,
but day by day, I began to think that it would be good if Selene also
had someone like Berry was to Lazura. It would surely be fun. Seeing
little Selene acting like a big sister and saying, "You're still a
child!" to that child, and laughing with Berry and Bogan. Bogan was a
little hesitant because he was worried about Lazura's body, but he
seemed to have similar thoughts and eventually agreed.

If I could give birth to one healthy child, that would be enough.  
I thought that way, but perhaps it was a punishment for being greedy.
When I got pregnant, I rejoiced and looked forward to seeing my child
grow up.

"Ah..."

"...Nee-san"

On the bed.  
Is there not enough blood?  
My head is fuzzy. My body is weak and my senses are dull.

Fragmented memories. I woke up several times and fell asleep each time,
but I don't feel my body has recovered.

A water pitcher is at my mouth. Honey-flavored water is poured in
quietly, and I drink it little by little.

"The child...was it no good after all?"

"It's not like that...Right now, in the next room—"

"...Fool.  
Do you intend to lie to your sister?"

My vision is blurry and unclear. But I can understand her voice, and I
can tell whether she's lying or not.  
Vaguely, I heard that the child was no good.  
It's just a pity it wasn't a dream.

"What a terrible thing you've done."

"Nee-san..."

"The two of them...?"

"It's been about three days since then.  
Ojou-sama seemed exhausted from crying...so I carried her to her room.  
The master is probably on his way back."

He came back earlier than expected, and Bogan went on an expedition that
doubled as the suppression of bandits.  
When I tell her "hand," my right hand is grasped.  
I have almost no sensation, but it's warm.

"I'll probably die," she said.

"Nee-san—"

"So listen."

She felt a hand gripping hers tightly.  
After a moment, a faint "Yes" was heard.

"...I'll leave that child feeling lonely.  
Please take her place."

"...Yes. Nee-san."

"You too...you work too hard...I'm worried."

A "Yes" in reply, a cheek resting on her hand.  
It was probably wet, moving slowly.

Lazura was, after all, just a normal human.  
Trying her best led to this; feelings and willpower couldn't fix
everything.  
She'd always relied on others, lived leaning on others.  
Half-baked Lazura simply couldn't fight alone.

But Lazura had an exceptionally excellent other half.  
A kind younger sister who would yield if asked.  
A girl who, like Lazura, couldn't live without Lazura.  
She'd cast countless charms on this, her world's best other half.

"...I'll definitely win."

"...?"

Even if Lazura died, her sister would always be by her side.  
She'd keep her promises.  
No matter what happened, she'd surely watch over Selene carefully.  
Until Selene was truly happy.  
Even betrayed, Berry wouldn't break her contract with Lazura.

"No matter who I lose to, I'll never...ever lose to you."

Lazura wasn't particularly strong or anything, but she had such a
sister.  
A sister who loved her more than anyone, and that alone made her
stronger than anyone.  
And her exceptionally capable sister, acting for her elder sister, would
grant Lazura any request.

She traced the contours of her cheek, touching her soft lips.  
She caressed them, teasingly, repeatedly.  
Casting charms over and over.

She'd never once granted her sister's request.  
She hadn't accepted it, yet she forced her to stay.  
She cast many curse-like spells, binding her, keeping her by her side.  
With fervent prayers to break the wicked spells, to make her forgive
Lazura.

A spell to never forget Lazura.

A spell to eventually forget Lazura.

A spell for her to find happiness, more than Lazura had known.

A spell to find happiness enough to forget.

A spell to meet a wonderful person.

A spell to be loved more than Lazura ever was.

"...This is that kind of charm."

Lazura was probably a wicked witch.  
But she wanted to offer a beautiful prayer, at least at the end.

Like she had done as a child, with a pure heart.

From the bottom of her heart, she earnestly wished for her sister's
future and happiness.

Someday, more than anyone else, she would be happy.

Even the half that rejected her, she would come to see as fate.

Hoping it would be so.

—This is that kind of charm.

On a bed in a dark room, lit only by moonlight.  
A red-haired girl holds a silver-haired girl on her lap, and speaks.

"—...I would like you to continue being with me like this."

A wish, once spun and then faded.

A curse-like word, overflowing from a crack in the sealed weight.  
Hesitantly, fearfully lowering her eyes as she spoke it.

She probably didn't fully understand its meaning.  
Nevertheless, the silver-haired girl sat up, settling onto her lap.  
Showing a twilight-colored gaze, a purple that hinted at evening's
approach, she kissed her happily.

"...Krische also wants to stay with Berry forever."

However she intended to respond, it was a contract.  
Nothing less than a vow made with a foolish girl.  
Cupping her cheeks in her hands, imprisoning the innocent girl in the
twilight with her magical eyes.  
The red-haired girl kissed her deeply, melting and mingling.

Even if they played until dusk, so that she wouldn't return, couldn't
return.  
With a curse-like wish.

—That is that kind of charm.
