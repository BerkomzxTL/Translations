# Chapter 314 - White Rabbit

"Narrator:  
Kahlua, Assistant Instructor of Usa-chan's Swordsmanship Style"

Huh?  
Is it true that Usa-chan single-handedly took down a castle?  
Oh, it's absolutely true. I saw it with my own eyes.  
It was during the… the Dismantling War… when was it again? Anyway, they
were attacking a castle. A pretty big one. Other armies had surrounded
it to prevent escape, but they couldn't take it down.  
I went to help out with Usa-chan, and let me tell you, it was
incredible. She single-handedly took out the enemy commander inside the
castle. The enemy was in a total panic…  
What?  
Lies? No, no, it’s true! I basically never lie, you know. What's with
that look, Mia? You're supposed to be playing with the children. You
have a nice dinner with the government officials later, right?  
Lucky you.

Anyway.

Even then, the enemy didn't give up, ignoring the call to surrender.
They said something about fighting to the last man and defending the
castle to the death, but Usa-chan got really mad at that. She threw her
spear and collapsed a section of the castle wall!  
Man, that was awesome. Those guys who were spouting all that tough talk,
they gave up after seeing that. They realized resistance was futile and
surrendered.

It's not a lie! Really, really true. Believe your onee-sama. Huh? I
heard some rude words just now. Let me tell you, bad kids who are
disrespectful to Kahlua-san will get a hundred spanks on their bottoms!

Anyway, that's what happened. You should ask Usa-chan when she comes
next time. You’ll see I'm not lying.  
What? You don't trust Usa-chan? She looks weak?  
Hmm, you still have a lot to learn. Looks and ability are completely
different things. Usa-chan is so strong I can't even lay a finger on
her. Really!  
I really want you all to understand that people aren't just what they
seem.

Look, even Mia, who looks so mellow, was feared as the greatest
swordsman of the Black Flag Special Forces before she put down her
sword. If she gets serious, even I can't beat her. If you don’t believe
me, try ambushing her sometime. Mia will dodge gracefully.  
Worried about hurting her?  
Yeah, yeah, I like kind children. Then just use something that won't
hurt.  
It’s snowing now, so let's all make snowballs to throw at Mia when she
gets back.  
You can throw those without hesitation, right?  
Zarka, you wanna join in? Great, good, good.  
We need to play sometimes, right?

Then I'll give a prize to whoever hits Mia the most from my onee-sama.  
Since that’s decided, let’s go outside—

"Narrator:  
Former Centurion Gerinas"

—The Dismantling War is recorded as a decisive victory for Alberan.  
That's true, but it's not that Elsren was weak.  
At that time, it was the largest nation on the continent, with
fortresses scattered everywhere and easily double the number of soldiers
as Alberan. Naturally, the same goes for the number of generals. They
say that Alberan's commanders were all monsters, but ultimately, the
important thing is the sheer numbers. The more people you have at the
bottom, the better the quality of those at the top, generally speaking.
It's probably true that Alberan had superior commanders at that time,
but it's not like Elsren's commanders were all incompetent.  
In fact, our commander was a hero who once hunted a demonic beast alone
– Fitzgeraldo, the Great Wolf Slayer – a name known to everyone.

I only saw his corpse, but it was a monstrous wolf, on all fours, bigger
than my head. Normally, a human with a stick wouldn't stand a chance,
but there are exceptional monsters among humans, and Fitzgeraldo was one
of them. He was a genial general who loved alcohol and was loved by his
soldiers, including me. He was such a fine person that I would have
given my life for him.

Elsren had many other brave warriors with renowned martial prowess, and
many truly lived up to their names. When that war started, nobody
thought that Elsren, the world's greatest nation, would be destroyed.
Even if we lost this battle, it would have just been a repeat of
history.  
I was only worried that the western part of Elsren would be taken.

But the reason Elsren was destroyed is because Alberinea wasn't human.  
That’s the short of it.

I had heard rumors that Alberan was planning to invade Elsren for a year
before it happened. The higher-ups obviously knew much earlier. In fact,
Elsren had a perfect formation for Alberan's initial attack. They
assembled a massive army to overwhelm the enemy—but Elsren suffered a
crushing defeat in the first battle.

It wasn't due to carelessness or overconfidence.  
The usual squabbles about who would take command. Even so, Elsren, as a
great nation, possessed the strength to defeat its enemies. Even if the
general was incompetent, the generals directly commanding the troops
were not, nor were the corps commanders.

It was expected to be a fierce battle. At that time, I was a centurion,
full of energy, and was saddened that General Fitzgeraldo couldn't
participate.  
Probably many soldiers felt the same.

However, in that single battle, most of the soldiers were either
captured or killed. The Alberan army was unscathed. Then came a
lightning-fast advance.

General Fitzgeraldo, ordered to buy time until the central forces could
launch a counteroffensive, deemed a direct confrontation too risky and
concentrated his troops in the Piriyurea Fortress. It was a historically
significant, sturdy fortress, with 7,000 troops gathered, protected by a
formidable trench and walls that could probably withstand one army's
attack. Most of the soldiers were veterans who had fought under General
Fitzgeraldo for a long time. The walls were thirty feet of stonework.
The enemy army of 5,000 that appeared didn't attack, just set up camp.

There were voices urging a counterattack, but General Fitzgeraldo
remained calm. Alberan had Jareia-Gashea, a monstrous ironclad. A
monster that could easily slaughter a hundred people with a single
machine—he confirmed its deployment and told us that we should
prioritize holding the fort and stalling the enemy's advance. He
probably figured that even if we defeated the 5,000, our losses would be
significant. A fortress only functions with a certain number of
people.  
Below that, it's all over.

Even if we defeated 5,000, the west would be outnumbered. Considering
the possibility of more enemy reinforcements, it was more advantageous
to hold out in a fortress where a smaller number could withstand greater
enemy pressure. If we pinned down the enemy, maybe the nomadic archers
would threaten their rear and stop their advance.

I still think the general was right, and I believe things went largely
as he planned. What caused the failure was the appearance of Alberinea a
week after the enemy set up camp.

Alberinea appeared as if on a sightseeing trip.  
Riding a Suiko with a single attendant, she leisurely circled the
fortress out of arrow range.

Marshal Selene Christand is recorded as the supreme commander of the
entire Alberan army, but she was commanding from the rear.  
Alberinea, who actively dashed across the battlefield, was the true
commander of Alberan – at least that's what the Elsren soldiers thought.
Naturally, eliminating such an opponent would change the course of the
war.

Many tried to eliminate her, of course, but she rode a tamed Suiko.  
Its speed was such that even magic possessors couldn’t catch it. We
could only watch, gnashing our teeth, and the commanders kept repeating
that it was just a provocation and to not engage.

Eventually, Alberinea left without incident, and the enemy remained
inactive. Many soldiers were relieved.  
Even Alberinea couldn’t handle this fortress with just one army corps,
they thought.  
We expected reinforcements, of course, and were prepared for it.
Everyone vaguely understood that we would eventually lose, but the
soldiers had pride. They were determined to fight alongside General
Fitzgeraldo in this fortress.  
Everyone was happy to enjoy their lives a little longer, patting each
other on the shoulder.  
We wouldn't die easily, they said, laughing, making as many enemies as
possible pay with their lives.

—Then came the night. I was on watch in the central part of the
fortress. Discipline is paramount in a siege. Even if the enemy wasn't
attacking, it was our squad's job to prevent deserters. I was looking at
my men in the watchtower, occasionally gazing outside the walls,
relieved that there was no night raid today, when suddenly the alarm
bells rang.

Not from the west where the Alberan army was stationed, but from the
east.  
Did other reinforcements arrive? I looked over but there were no troops
to be seen. What I saw were corpses and a Suiko tumbling over the walls,
and Alberinea with silver hair. I was stunned for a moment, but I was
even more shocked when Alberinea jumped off the tiger and entered the
interior of the walls.

She jumped into a fortress with 7,000 soldiers, alone. Everyone who saw
it must have reacted the same way I did. My men frantically rang the
alarm bells in the tower, everyone shouting that Alberinea had
infiltrated.  
Every time I saw Alberinea running through the fortress from the tower,
I gave instructions, but Alberinea killed soldiers as she passed,
fleeing into buildings and onto rooftops whenever she encountered a
squad. Even if some skilled magic possessors managed to block her path,
she killed them with a single swing of her sword. The fortress was in
chaos. Arrows aimed at Alberinea hit other soldiers, and some squads
were engaged in a melee of friendly fire in the darkness.

I lost sight of her in an instant, and regaining my composure, I looked
towards the room where the general was resting. The general must have
been awakened by the commotion. He grabbed his sword and leaned out the
window, shouting, "What's happening!? Where is Alberinea!?"  
Just as I was about to answer, "I've lost sight of her! The general
should go to a safe place—" something flew and shattered the window
frame where the general was standing.

I only learned that it was Alberinea's spear after everything was over.
I was dumbfounded until Alberinea emerged from the broken wall, carrying
a bloody bag. No, not until she emerged. I remained dumbfounded until
Alberinea left the fortress.

Fitzgeraldo, the Great Wolf Slayer.  
Even for me, who witnessed it, it took time to accept the fact that such
a hero was dead.

Nobody slept that night.  
The general had been killed inside the fortress by a single person. That
was the situation until Alberinea appeared with a blue flag the next
morning.

“Your commander, Coloces-Fitzgeraldo, was slain by Krische last night.
As the commander of the Alberan army in this location, I demand your
immediate disarmament and surrender, and the handover of this fortress.”

I was still on the watchtower. I couldn't hear her voice clearly, even
though I could see her, but apparently, she said something like that.  
I saw the female soldier beside Alberinea place a head in front of the
trench—not many would have seen her face clearly, but with Fitzgeraldo's
headless corpse, there was no need to use a fake. Everyone accepted the
reality, and more than half of the soldiers lost their will to fight.  
An opponent who could storm a fortress alone and take the head of a
renowned hero.  
There’s no winning against such a monster. Even I, who witnessed it all,
had no desire to fight.

But the general's long-time comrade, the second-in-command, shouted,
refusing to succumb to such a cowardly tactic. Even without the general,
this fortress would fight to the last man, he declared, and avenge the
general. The soldiers who still had fighting spirit responded—human
beings are strangely susceptible to such atmospheres.

Even if Alberinea was strong, she was alone.  
Even if she had taken the hero's head, she couldn't take the hero's
fortress alone.  
Hearing the second-in-command's words, remembering the general's order
to defend the fortress, I thought we might be able to put up some
resistance.

—But I only thought about it. I didn't have the chance to put it into
action. Because I learned that Alberinea was a monster who could take a
fortress alone.

Alberinea spoke with the woman beside her, had a soldier lower the blue
flag, received a spear from a soldier behind her, and then said:

“I consider this a broken negotiation. This will be a bit troublesome,
but excuse me.”

Then she reversed the spear, ran, and threw it.

I was dumbfounded. Alberinea's spear brought down the high walls with
just three throws. Can you believe it? You can't, right?  
But this is the unadulterated, unvarnished truth.

That Alberinea, with just a throw, could collapse the thirty-foot-high
walls. No, not just a throw.  
Not just a throw. It was a monstrous throw that dwarfed siege bows.
Alberinea throws a spear with such speed that even the sound is left
behind.

She looks like a child.  
Even for a woman, she’s short—she doesn't seem to have any muscles.  
Yet, Alberinea turns an ordinary spear into a siege weapon.

The fortress was in a panic when Alberinea started collapsing the walls
with her spear throws. The archers couldn't respond fast enough.  
Hundreds on the walls and below were dead or incapacitated. Screams
erupted everywhere, and Alberinea continued throwing spears.  
The walls collapsed further, and the defense towers fell. She must have
aimed for that—the defense towers collapsed onto the walls. I later
heard that the number of people killed by just the spear throws was not
just hundreds, but nearly a thousand.  
The brave second-in-command who was desperately shouting was also
apparently caught in it and died.

I was just staring dumbfounded—what else could I do? Alberinea seemed
like she would throw spears forever, throwing them as if they were a
weapon itself. She finally stopped when the woman next to her spoke.

“I think the second-in-command is dead, what do you think?  
If you really intend to fight to the last man, then we have no choice
but to kill everyone…”

Krische’s a little tired too, she apparently continued casually. She had
killed a thousand people by collapsing the walls, and she was a little
tired. By the time that ‘tired’ turned into complete exhaustion, none of
us would have survived.

“I'll launch an assault on the fortress in an hour. If you don't wish
for that, a proper commander should raise the blue flag and surrender
before then. Let me declare in advance that Krische will not accept
surrender during the ensuing melee after the fortress' assault. Consider
this your last chance and surrender promptly. It would be appreciated.”

After saying that, she politely bowed her head and rode her Suiko
away.  
You don’t need to ask what happened next.  
That was it—nobody had the will to fight anymore.

“…It’s extremely regrettable, but further fighting will only needlessly
increase casualties. We have no choice but to comply.”

When one of the captains said that with a bitter expression, nobody
uttered a word. You can fight when you know you're going to lose only if
the opponent is equal. Even if you’re outnumbered, if your opponent is a
human, you can be a hero.

But challenging a storm isn't heroic, it’s just stupid. And
unfortunately, Alberinea wasn't human.  
That war, in its entirety, was like that.

"Narrator: Former Sergeant Alvis"

—That sight is burned into my mind, and I don't think I'll ever forget
it, even in my grave.

That was when I was still a young man, barely twenty years old.  
I was a soldier on the battlefield.

A hot-headed bully—yes, back then I was just a reckless brat like you,
only hairier. I left the village, joined the army, and boasted about
becoming a general.  
Deep down I was terrified, but I kept blustering, and I even managed to
convince my squad leader to let me take the lead at the front of the
army. But life is unpredictable. And perhaps it was precisely because of
that experience that I was able to wake up from my dreams.

Our first battle against an enemy army numbering over 100,000 ended
without a single clash of swords.  
Jareia-Gashea—Alberinea, having broken through the enemy lines with her
iron puppets, swiftly decapitated the enemy commander.  
There were two minor skirmishes after that, and those were the only
times I ever killed anyone. I still remember vividly the faces of those
three men I killed, even how I killed them. No, it would be more
accurate to say I \*can't\* forget them.

Killing is terrifying. It's literally one person killing another. For
example, picture the faces of the people in your village. In a
one-on-one fight, could you kill everyone whose face you can picture?

Well, there would be some you could kill. Women, children, the elderly,
the weak—there are plenty of them. But what about your father, who would
scold you and make you cry? Or the other adults? You couldn't beat
someone like me, an old man.

And the battlefield is a unique world. It's a place where the best and
second-best fighters from various villages gather, enduring brutal
training designed to kill, and becoming hardened soldiers. If we are
like that, then so are they.  
The enemy is by no means weak, and you see more than your fill of
powerfully built men. So, in such a place, you have no choice but to
fight a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice. Killing is always a
life-or-death affair.

Look. This scar on my arm is from when someone bit it off. In a melee,
in a situation where you have to kill or be killed, everyone uses any
means necessary.  
Gouging out an eye, breaking fingers, raking claws down a throat,
smashing heads with helmets or stones you find lying around—that kind of
terrifying thing is what it takes to survive. I've never killed anyone
with a sword or spear.  
Out of sheer terror, I would grapple with them, hitting them until they
died; those were the shameful victories that kept me alive.  
Back then, I boasted about my fighting style, calling myself a 'mad
dog,' but deep down, I knew better.

After that, I wondered how many times I would have to repeat this to
become a general. A hundred times? A thousand? Would I even live that
long?

It's impossible. I could die after ten times, or even the next battle.
I'm simply a soldier who's good at fighting, blessed with a bit more
physique than most. I have no choice but to win against other soldiers
through these desperate gambles. Even a one-on-one fight is a stroke of
luck on the battlefield.  
Three enemies might attack you, and all three might be bigger and
stronger than you.

And on the battlefield, there are monsters who slaughter dozens, even
hundreds of soldiers like me all by themselves. If we have them, then so
do they.  
When I encountered such an opponent, I knew I would be the one who got
killed.

Even so, like the foolish youth I was, confusing recklessness with
courage, I remained at the forefront. I kept telling myself that I was
different from the others, desperately trying to convince myself—that's
when it happened.

—Piryurea Fortress.  
Surrounded by a deep moat and sturdy walls thirty feet high.  
Imagine enemies standing on top of a two-story house.  
We had to fill the moat and somehow climb the walls amidst a hail of
arrows.  
Even as we climbed the ladders, we were pelted with rocks, scalding oil,
and arrows.

When I heard that this was the next place we had to conquer, I knew I
wouldn't return alive. I had volunteered for the front line.  
Naturally, I would be leading the way up the ladders.

Inside were seven thousand soldiers.  
Even if the enemy came out to attack, I, being at the front, would die.
I laughed with false bravado, pretending I wasn't afraid, but at night I
trembled and couldn't sleep.  
I prayed that the reinforcements, whenever they came, wouldn't be placed
on the front line.

But a week passed, and only two people came as reinforcements.  
I wondered what was going on, but those two were Alberinea and her black
cat. They were riding an unbelievably large magical beast—a Suiko. A
four-legged, eight-foot-tall Suiko that looked like it could swallow a
person in two bites.

Seeing such a monstrous creature up close would make anyone's knees
tremble.  
Riding this creature was a small, petite girl.  
A strikingly beautiful woman with silver hair and purple eyes—Alberinea,
who looked almost like a child.  
And next to her, a slender beauty with long hair flowing like a horse's
tail—Alberinea's black cat.

Riding a terrifying magical beast, they laughed and chatted on the
battlefield as if they were out for a leisurely stroll. When I saw that,
I thought they were conducting an advance reconnaissance mission ahead
of the reinforcements.  
Surely, if these two had arrived, more soldiers would follow. Alberinea
had developed magical siege weapons, and an army equipped for sieges
would soon arrive.

But, as I said before, the reinforcements were only those two. And that
was all it took.

“Um, let's attack the less guarded side at night. Their morale seems
pretty high, but if we quickly take out the commander, they might
surrender… ”

“Usa-chan, are you really not going to bring your 'pishoon'?  
I'm not worried about Usa-chan anymore, but to achieve peace, we need to
show off the strength of Alberan's army, not just use underhanded
tricks, or so they said.  
Didn't Selene say so too?”

“That's true, but… if we take a detour here, it'll delay our schedule by
three days.  
With walls that level, we don't even need 'pishoon', just 'byu-un' with
the spears.  
They're pretty dilapidated.”

They rode the Suiko around the perimeter of the fortress and came back.
I remember them having this conversation as they passed by. Honestly, I
didn't understand much of what they were saying—but the real issue was
that night.

That day we had an early dinner and a break, and when the sun set, we
were roused.  
The order was to be particularly vigilant against a night attack.
Alberinea was coming.  
Of course, there was a possibility that the enemy would attack.  
Without any particular questions, I braced myself and stood guard at the
entrance to the camp.

“Um, Kahlua, it's okay if you don't wait for me, right?”

“Well, I'm Usa-chan's attendant, so I can't just sleep soundly while my
superior officer is going out on a mission.”

“Haa… well, if you say so.  
I'm going then.”

“Yes, yes, see you later.”

Yawning and exchanging lighthearted words, the two of them appeared at
the entrance: Alberinea and her black cat.  
Just as I was wondering where they were going, the Suiko dashed off like
a sudden gust of wind, Alberinea heading towards the fortress—and
disappearing immediately into the darkness. I'd heard it was fast,
faster than any horse, but it still startled me.

"Excuse me for a moment," the black cat yawned, leaning against a
gatepost, and we exchanged confused glances.

Alberinea's black cat—whose name was Kahlua, I learned.  
A beautiful woman with lustrous black hair, slender and elegant, as I
said before.  
She was wearing the famous black flag special forces uniform—a black
dyed breastplate and gauntlets. At her waist hung a large curved sword,
like an axe or a great cleaver.  
Even when I was training, I wonder if I could have even lifted and swung
it.  
It felt incredibly heavy.  
She seemed to be carrying an impossibly heavy weapon, yet there was a
strange lightness to her posture and movements that belied its weight.

You'll understand this feeling. When you face someone stronger than
yourself, you can feel the pressure on your skin.  
Even without facing them, the more you train, the more you can sense it
just from the way they stand.  
I was taller and more powerfully built, but just looking at her standing
there, I felt the same kind of fear I had felt from the Suiko.

That monster who could kill hundreds of soldiers on their own—this woman
was one of them, I realized.  
A soldier revered by the soldiers, the leader of the elite Black Flag
Special Forces. From the war before to the Unification War afterward,
she achieved countless feats of valor as a soldier, earning the respect
even of generals and army commanders.  
I never witnessed her fighting style, but I was certain that the rumors
were true. That air of authority emanated from Kahlua-sama.

Waiting for Alberinea's return, she probably noticed us watching.
Kahlua-sama briefly explained where Alberinea had gone.

“The enemy commander’s head… you mean?”

“Yes. Usa-chan will be bringing the enemy commander’s head back soon, so
we're waiting for her.”

Of course, we couldn't possibly understand this explanation. We asked
what was going on, and her response was this:

“She's going to infiltrate the fortress alone and behead the enemy
commander.”

I thought it was some kind of joke. A kind of preparation for some
operation—something she couldn't tell us about. A top-ranking commander
personally sneaking into an enemy fortress guarded by seven thousand
soldiers to assassinate their commander was preposterous.

“No joke, it's really happening.  
Even seven thousand, even a million soldiers, couldn't kill Usa-chan in
a place as complex as a fortress.  
The moment they chose to besiege, they lost…  
Good luck.  
It seems we've avoided a pointless battle, and we won't have any
casualties on our side.”

“H-haaa…”

“You’ll see soon enough.  
Usa-chan is strong, the strongest—it's not even on that level.”

But, as Kahlua-sama said, after a while the fortress grew noisy, the
number of bonfires increased—and less than half an hour after she left,
Alberinea returned, dragging a blood-soaked bag on the end of her spear.

“Usa-chan, you're back.”

“Yes, I'm home.  
I had a general idea of where he would be, but it took a little longer
than I expected to find him. It helped that he showed his face.”

Alberinea said this, looking around, and probably because she was near
Kahlua-sama, she pointed the spear at me and showed me the bag.

“The enemy commander’s head.  
It’s dripping blood, so be careful not to get your clothes dirty. Please
clean it up a bit before taking it to Commander Tolsine’s tent.”

“Y-yes…!”

“Kahlua, let's just make a report and go to sleep.”

“Yes, yes… well, leave that to you.”

Kahlua-sama also hopped onto the Suiko, and the two of them went to the
tent.  
We were dumbfounded, but seeing the blood-soaked bag, we decided to get
to work and took out the head. Inside was the head of a general with
noticeable old wounds. He must have been a valiant warrior, but his eyes
were wide open, his face frozen in a look of surprise. I shuddered
seeing Alberinea's small figure as she nonchalantly departed, as if she
had merely handed us some small package.

She had cut the general's head from a fortress guarded by 7000 soldiers
and returned with no noticeable dirt and the same smile she wore when
she left.

As I carefully cleaned the pitiful warrior's head, my hands trembled.

Then, the next day, we formed our battle lines for a surrender demand to
the enemy army.  
With the general's head taken, they had no hope of winning.  
Everyone had heard about what had happened the previous night, and
everyone thought the enemy would surely surrender. But as Alberinea
demanded their surrender, the enemy's second-in-command shouted,
rallying his disheartened soldiers. They were determined to fight to the
bitter end.

Soldiers still standing after having their general killed in a single
night raid. I still remember their roars. Without Alberinea, we would
have suffered many casualties, or we would have been defeated. I, at the
forefront, would have certainly died—and you, your father, and all of
you wouldn't be born.

This was undoubtedly going to be a battle.  
I heard the veterans encouraging each other, whispering words of
encouragement, and I braced myself for death.

“Really now… they're not listening.”

“What to do?  
It's obvious…”

“Yes.  
Hey, the squad over there, please bring the spears.”

“Yes! Hey, let's go, spears!”

We, standing right behind, were called upon, and I was pushed forward.  
Alberinea held out her small hand, and I handed her a spear with a
perplexed expression.  
I wondered what she was going to do with the spear, but Alberinea was a
master spear thrower.  
She would probably throw the spear at the enemy's second-in-command to
intimidate them—that’s what I thought.

“I consider that negotiations have broken down.  
Well, this is a bit troublesome, but excuse me.”

Alberinea said something like that to them and stepped forward—but it’s
hard to describe it well. What do you imagine when you hear someone say
they’re throwing a spear?  
Perhaps they hold the spear to their shoulder and throw it—something
like that.

But Alberinea's spear throw was different. In the blink of an eye, she
was far ahead, and when I realized what was happening, there was a
thunderous roar.  
Even though I was watching it firsthand, I couldn't understand how she
threw the spear.  
When Alberinea came running back, part of the wall had collapsed,
screams were rising from the enemy soldiers, and as the third spear was
thrown, the wall, which had seemed so sturdy, crumbled.  
I was dumbfounded at the sight before me, it felt unreal.

She ran and threw, collapsing towers, crushing soldiers on the wall, or
sending them plunging into the moat—how many people did she kill with
that?  
I had seen several powerful warriors on the battlefield who could kill
hundreds of people alone. And even they were terrifying.  
But even those warriors paled in comparison to Alberinea, who could
topple a fortress with a mere spear throw.  
Anyone who sees Alberinea single-handedly dismantling a fortress which
would require thousands, even tens of thousands of soldiers like us to
conquer would think so.

How small my existence on the battlefield felt. I could easily have been
among the soldiers screaming as they died in the fortress. No matter how
much you train your body, no matter how much experience you gain, it
means nothing in the face of someone like Alberinea.  
When I realized that, I finally woke up from my dream and returned to
being a timid man.

Whether I was boasting or not, in the world of the battlefield, ordinary
people like me are utterly insignificant. My life, my efforts, the
courage I mustered—all were merely numbers consumed like expendable
resources on the battlefield.

Each of those soldiers had their own lives.  
They probably had their dreams and hopes, wives and children, they may
have been masters who had honed their bodies and minds, heroes who had
made their names even in the military. —But just by standing before
Alberinea, they were mercilessly killed like insects, and I thought to
myself, “I don’t want to end up like that. I don’t want to die like
that.”

That’s why I returned to this village after that war.

I'm glad you admire me. I understand your yearning for soldiery in the
monotony of everyday life. But that’s what the battlefield is like.
Everyone calls me a village hero who survived the Great War, but I'm not
a hero; I'm just someone who luckily survived the battlefield.  
Unless you’re a warrior capable of taking on the whole village,  
no, I wouldn't even send such a person off with a smile.  
Because there are people in this world, like Alberinea, who could take
down a hundred such warriors in one go.

Don’t do anything foolish, like hurting yourself on purpose just to
understand the preciousness of your health.  
Even unchanging days will eventually hold small, precious changes.

My current life, having actually seen the battlefield, is proof of that.
