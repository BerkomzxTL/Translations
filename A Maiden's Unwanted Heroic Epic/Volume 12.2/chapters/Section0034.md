# Chapter 344 - Charm 3

I don't think Loubel was a bad person.  
His gentle nature, shown since my childhood and towards Berry, was also
a part of him. He readily granted Lazura's whims without complaint,
taught his younger sister her studies, acknowledged her talent, and
sincerely encouraged her to pursue academics.

However, people are multifaceted, and there's no such thing as a perfect
person. What's visible on the surface isn't the whole story.

We all try to conceal our darker sides, to suppress them. Even if they
sometimes surface, that doesn't define us entirely.  
He was probably someone who had faced setbacks and suffered from
inferiority complex. But I also believe he was a truly dedicated, kind,
and loving teacher who cared deeply for his students.

After some time, he calmed down, regretted his actions, visited the
mansion, explained the situation to my father, resigned from his
teaching position, apologized to Lazura for the harsh things he said to
Berry due to his own immaturity. It was, I believe, a sincere apology.  
He wished to apologize to Berry as well, but she was ill and bedridden,
so Lazura conveyed his message later.

I think he felt ashamed to face Berry. He deeply regretted angering
Loubel, whom he greatly respected. For a while after that, even when
Lazura visited, Berry pretended to be asleep.  
Even when she started talking again, she stopped leaving her room to get
books, and stopped asking for anything.

The servants gossiped about Berry angering the usually gentle Loubel,
and began to view her with increasing unease, as she remained confined
to her room. My younger sister, who was beginning to look toward the
outside world, retreated further into herself, spending her days in bed.
She started distancing herself from Lazura, repeatedly saying she didn't
need to visit anymore.

"...I have no appetite."

"No, you must eat even if you force yourself.  
I won't leave until you finish."

Her body was much thinner than before. Her health had deteriorated
considerably, yet she would leave her food untouched due to lack of
appetite.  
It worried me greatly, especially since she was at an age of rapid
growth.

"Here, open wide."

I forced a spoonful of soup into her mouth, and she finally started
eating. I repeated this several times, and tears welled up in her
downcast eyes. She covered her face and quietly began to cry.  
She choked on a sob, and I stroked her back until she calmed down.

When I hugged her, Berry seemed both relieved and resistant. Her body
relaxed, then stiffened. She hated her dependence on me, hated being
cared for. She whispered that she wanted to disappear, to vanish. Every
day, she relentlessly blamed herself in her head. She believed she had
been a burden since her birth.

I think my sister had never truly accepted herself. Despite possessing a
talent that many envied, she was consumed by feelings of inferiority.  
She couldn't do things that ordinary people could do easily. She
couldn't comprehend things that ordinary people easily understood. Her
ideals concerning her talent grew excessively, leaving no room for
excuses, even those related to her age. She blamed herself for all the
misfortunes in her life.

I tried to empathize, to understand, but I couldn't help but feel like I
was rejecting her. Even when I repeatedly told her she didn't need to
blame herself, my words didn't reach her properly.  
Still, I hoped, even a little, that my words would somehow get
through.  
I had no choice but to believe in the power of my words.

"Even if you hate yourself so much that you want to disappear, I love
you a hundred times more. …Even if you want to disappear, live for your
nee-san who loves you."

I gently stroked my sister's head, who didn't answer.

"And, don't ever say such things again. …It makes your nee-san sad."

I repeated the same words over and over again. If even a little bit of
it reached her, it would be enough.  
Her self-reproach needed even one different voice.

I wished that one day, my sister would stop blaming herself. I hoped
that my words would contribute even a little towards that.

One day, a chubby man emerged from the drawing-room.

"Oh my, my, Lazura-sama…you've become even more beautiful. It's been
since the Earl Berthies' banquet."

"...It has been a while. Are you here for business with Father today?"

"Yes."

He bowed politely, dressed in fine clothes. However, what I disliked was
his gaze.  
It felt like he was appraising me.

I had been trying to avoid him, but I knew he had been visiting
frequently lately. He wasn't a hugely wealthy merchant, but he was young
and had a diverse business portfolio.  
My father spoke highly of his business acumen, saying he was a talented
merchant for his age. There was a past connection between the Argan
family and him, as they had cooperated on an issue involving our managed
territories.

"How is Berry-sama?"

"She isn't doing very well, but she's calmer…"

"...I see. I've been searching high and low for a good doctor for her...
For now, I've brought some things for your father that are said to be
good for health…"

"...Thank you. I appreciate it."

His gestures and expressions were overly theatrical. I didn't
particularly like him, but he was my father's business partner. He did
bring things to help Berry’s health, so I felt I should be grateful.  
I knew there were rumors that the Argan family was on the decline, and
maintaining relationships with merchants was crucial.

"I sincerely hope she makes a full recovery."

He dramatically pressed his hand to his chest and bowed deeply. While
his actions were exaggerated, I didn't doubt his words. It was because
Roland genuinely cared about my sister's health. For him, Lazura and
Berry were already commodities of the future.

Those who approach a declining noble family are often those who seek to
exploit them.  
Lazura didn’t fully understand that for merchants, a noble family itself
is valuable. She was optimistic, believing that with enough effort,
things would always improve.

After parting ways with him, I went to the drawing-room. My father was
there, looking troubled, reviewing contracts and documents. His
well-groomed mustache and neatly combed red hair. Father, Reald Argan,
always maintained his noble appearance. His jacket was spotless, his
trousers impeccably creased. But the weariness in his eyes, the deep
shadows under them, could not be hidden.

"...Father."

"Lazura. …How is Berry?"

"She's calmer. …But…"

"...?"

"...Nothing.  
She's just a bit down."

I always visited to talk about Berry, but I couldn't bring myself to
speak once I saw my father's face. His tired face…the light in his room
always stayed on late into the night. He would go out at dawn, visiting
various places, and return late at night.  
I knew how much he was doing for his stepmother and sister. I couldn't
add to his worries.

"I'll visit her later. Come to my room."

"...Yes."

But, as if sensing my hesitation, he smiled and stroked my head.

"You've been through a lot. I'm sorry."

"No, it's not a hardship…"

The touch of his gentle, large hand made me feel reassured, like a
child. It felt somewhat shameful. Compared to my suffering sister and
father, Lazura had lived a relatively comfortable life. I had been
blessed with many things and hadn't faced much hardship.

"Father."

"What is it?"

"Well…I've learned the basics of academics. I think I can continue my
studies independently, without a tutor, without causing any shame."

"...Those are things a child doesn't need to worry about."

"I'm already thirteen. I'm not a child."

When I said that, my father chuckled and stroked my head again.

"Children always say that. …But if you insist you're an adult, then you
should consider things from a broader perspective."

"A broader perspective…?"

"If we dismiss the tutor, it will certainly save on tuition.  
Frankly, it's a significant financial burden for our family, and
eliminating it would be highly beneficial. That's what you're thinking,
isn't it?"

"...? Yes…"

He continued, confirming that I wasn't wrong.

"However, the Argan family is already rumored to be in decline.  
If we dismiss the tutor, it will only reinforce the rumors that we're
struggling financially. In such a situation, Lazura, would you lend
money to this family?"

"...No."

"Exactly. You won't be trusted. That's how it is; you have to look at
things from various angles. And this isn’t just about money."

Remember that, he said with a smile.  
He always smiled kindly at me. To him, I was always his daughter, his
child.

"And nobles are sustained by trust. Under the protection of His Majesty,
we are granted many privileges, but in return, we are expected to live
without sullying our name, our family name, or the name of His Majesty.
…This is not mere vanity."

He sipped his black bean tea, his eyes twinkling.

"Nobles value their name above life itself. As a noble, even if we lose
our food, clothing, and shelter, we must live without shame. …I have
married two wonderful wives and have two beloved children."

Then, looking at me, he stroked my head.

"I've sworn to my wives and to my name that I will make you and Berry
happy. …Don't worry about me.  
Your worries will eventually disappear."

"...Yes."

My father was truly a noble I deeply respected. A man who lived by his
name—no matter what, he never betrayed his name. Even in the face of
great hardship, he would naturally live this way.

"Roland brought some good news today.  
If we can secure the funds, there will be significant profits. That
should resolve many of our problems."

He showed me the documents, and I took them. It was a deal involving
magical crystals, whose production has been declining in recent years. A
large vein had reportedly been discovered in the north, and a
significant price drop was expected.  
This deal involved preemptively forming a long-term fixed-price sales
contract with the artisan's guild.

If the price of magical crystals drops, the difference would be the
profit.  
Because of the need to get a long-term contract from the guild before
the drop, the deal is slightly lower than the current market price, but
not at a significantly risky amount.  
At a glance, it seemed fine. … Unless the price goes up instead.

"Isn't there a risk of price increase?"

"Of course, I've considered that… Even if the vein isn't as large as we
expect, the impact would be minimal. The other factor is war.  
Elderant, after being defeated, is embroiled in internal conflict. The
new regime in Gulshan is still fragile.  
It's unlikely that either will attack soon. Elsren is preoccupied with
deciding their next emperor… They won't attack here for some time."

If there is a war, primary industries such as mining would inevitably
decline.  
Workers would move to become soldiers, which are more lucrative,
resulting in a significant loss of labor for general production. The
price of mineral resources in general circulation would naturally
skyrocket. Although there are differences depending on demand, magical
crystals are also used in everyday products. While the overall demand
doesn't increase dramatically like iron ore, it also doesn't decrease,
so the price is greatly influenced by production volume.

"The other possibility is that our country attacks another. But His
Majesty has only recently succeeded the throne of King Albeza. He's busy
with the transition and doesn't have the resources to launch an attack
on another country… and Roland confirmed that as well."

"I see…"

"He's a man with wide-reaching connections… trustworthy in that
regard.  
Normally, one wouldn't expect an immediate attack on another country,
and we haven't heard any such rumors. Well, I think it's fine… but just
in case, I intend to discreetly ask those I know about this."

"...I see."

From what I heard, there didn't seem to be any problems.  
Based on the situation I knew, my father's reasoning seemed sound, and
the chances of success were high.  
Business can't be considered without risk.  
Considering the risk and return, it was a good deal.

Roland originally comes from the central region of Keerzalan.  
He frequents the royal capital, so the accuracy of his information is
likely high.  
I was uneasy about Roland making this proposal, but the Argan family had
earned considerable profit through previous dealings with him, so
barring my personal dislike, there didn't seem to be any issues.

"There's no guarantee of no risk here, and even though it's business, it
does give me some hesitation…  
Still, looking at it, the trading partners are all major players.  
They are unlikely to go bankrupt. …Pursuing profit is the way of a
merchant. If the profits become too large, the contract needs to be
revised… but exploiting profits to the point of threatening their
livelihoods would be against the ways of a noble."

"...Yes."

His troubled expression was likely due to this. In the business world,
information is everything; suffering losses due to lack of knowledge is
one's own fault.  
That's why merchants build connections with people across various
regions and gather information.  
But my father was a noble, not a merchant.  
While it wasn't fraudulent, he didn't like these methods.

If he were alone, he might not have chosen this path.  
He was an honest man who disliked crooked dealings. But he decided on
this course of action for Lazura and Berry. To keep the oath he made to
his name, to make his family happy.

"...I'm truly fortunate."

When my father tilted his head, I shook my head and smiled.

"I suddenly realized that."

The people who helped me learn and reflect were all around me. That
alone made me more fortunate than anyone.

The deal between my father and Roland was indeed not a bad one.  
There was only one potential problem.

Only if Roland had intentionally withheld information to trap my
father.  
That was the only condition under which the deal could be problematic.

Less than a year after the contract was signed, Prince Gildanstein
launched an invasion of the eastern part of Ulfenate, Elsren.  
Elsren retreated, burning villages as they fell back, while Alberan
pushed forward. Then, a counterattack began—a protracted and bloody
war.  
Roland, with tears in his eyes, rubbed his forehead against my father’s,
begging forgiveness.  
It was, he explained, an unexpected invasion, almost a solo decision by
the prince. He promised to cooperate in the financial recovery to the
best of his ability, and my father nodded.  
He had no choice.

Though I suspected internally that my father had been trapped by Roland,
no merchant or noble would do further business with the Argan family
after such a major failure.  
I had to believe Roland when he said that it was an accidental tragedy.

My father, already burdened with worry and overworked, desperately tried
to recover from the failure, running himself ragged until he collapsed
and passed away when I was fifteen.  
As he lay in bed, tears streaming down his face, he apologized, and I
told him it was alright.

For the first time in my life, I pledged my name and asked to be allowed
to take charge.
