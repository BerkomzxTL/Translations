# Chapter 330 - Simulation Game Style Country Explanation

■Simulation Game-Style National Explanation (Chapter 1 Start)

This is a playful attempt at a simulation-style game, so be warned if
you dislike this style.

○Alberan Kingdom Difficulty: ★★★ (Historical Correct Route is Tutorial)

Economic Power: 4 Military Power: 5 Technological Power: 4 Population: 4
Manpower: 5+

A former superpower located relatively northwest on the continent.  
In the past, it controlled half the continent and concluded the Sacred
Spirit Pact with dragons, spreading it as international law; there is no
country on the continent unaware of Alberan.  
Although it lost much territory after splitting with Elsren, it hasn't
lost all its former strength and remains one of the strong nations with
a powerful military, high technology, and a strong economy.

However, caution is necessary as it's surrounded by powerful nations:
Elsren to the east, Elderant to the west, and Garshaan to the south, and
its relationships with them are strained. Furthermore, in the main
scenario "Two Children of Scorn," the current king suffers from an
unknown illness, and a hidden struggle for the succession is occurring
between the princess and the prince.  
Therefore, an uneasy atmosphere hangs over the royal palace, and if
handled improperly, it could quickly lead to a desperate situation early
on.

Even as a strong nation, it requires careful consideration in various
aspects.

Also, be aware that this country occasionally produces individuals with
extraordinarily high abilities.  
They are difficult to judge, but in many cases, they have significant
personality flaws, so remember that mismanaging them can make them a
double-edged sword.

Since this country originally has many talented individuals, eliminating
such people early on is one strategy.  
In the post-Elsren split scenario, the policy "Elimination of the
Children of Scorn" eliminates these individuals at birth, but it’s not
perfect and has many drawbacks. Their exceptional abilities could
backfire.

Whether to utilize or eliminate them greatly changes gameplay.  
It's a fascinating country.

The strength of a perfect Alberan, achievable by preventing a split
among the prince's faction, is a must-see. 'Gildenstein = Alberan'
repents through the 'Uncle and Niece' exchange event with 'Krische =
Christand'. First, try to resolve the conflict with 'Kreschenta =
Alberan' through interaction.  
In the scenario fourteen years before "Two Children of Scorn," "The
Child Who Doesn't Cry," choosing "Break the Bad Habit" allows you to
make 'Krischelia = Alberan,' making things smoother. 'Gildenstein =
Alberan' repents after interacting with her.

☆Recommended Troop Types

\* Light Infantry

  
As a former superpower, the average ability of its military is high
across the board.  
The vast knowledge and know-how accumulated by those who conquered half
the continent. The military structure built from this is still worthy of
a king's army and possesses high redundancy.

  
Above average in all aspects is Alberan's charm.

  
If we were to choose one, it would be light infantry.

  
Alberan has many forests and mountains.  
The light infantry of this nation, nurtured in that environment, are
highly capable, and combined with the aforementioned redundancy, they
can stably perform highly advanced tactical coordination.

  
However, their defensive capabilities are the same as other nations'
light infantry, so be careful in handling them.

\* Jaleia = Gashea

  
Alberan's exclusive high-tier heavy infantry.  
Progressing through the main scenario "Two Children of Scorn" and
triggering the Alberan late-game events "Birth of Alberinea" and "Mass
Production of Magical Weapons" makes them relatively easy to obtain.

  
With exceptional breakthrough and attack power, you won't lose in
frontal combat, but they are very expensive units, so be wary of
surprise attacks and sabotage.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

Preventing Alberinea-related events is fundamental to dealing with
Alberan.  
Once 'Krische = Christand' achieves merit and gains power, they become
untouchable. However, if Alberinea-related events progress, Alberan
acquires her and she automatically becomes the highest-level commander
unit.

In Elsren and Elderant, to avoid 'Alberinea's Awakening,' which occurs
during her first battle, avoid battles with the northern kingdom as much
as possible.  
While a swift defeat of the Christand army with an overwhelming force
difference is possible, the Christand army at difficulty: Hard and above
has abnormally high commander unit stats, top-tier morale and training,
making swift defeat essentially impossible.  
Avoiding battle is the best option.

Even if these historical events are avoided or turned off, it remains a
very powerful nation. Over time, 'Krische = Christand' automatically
becomes the commander unit of the northern army. To conquer, avoid
battle with the northern army and aim for a swift capture of the
capital.

Specifically, 'Krische = Christand' in the historical difficulty has the
'Trait: Heavenly Sword,' dramatically increasing tactical success rate.
They'll constantly challenge your commander units to single combat with
high probability. Once they form the 'Black Hundred Squad' or 'Black
Flag Special Operations Squad' over time or through events and become
their private army, their tactical success rate becomes virtually 100%,
making them invincible.  
The key to victory is how to eliminate the northern army.  
Also, if she is in a siege, large siege weapons are destroyed by the
effect of 'Trait: Heavenly Sword,' making a large-scale siege and
annihilation effective.

Garshaan is recommended because you can aim for the capital's capture
with an initial all-out attack without worrying about the north.  
It's extremely difficult because you must defeat 'Dougleen = Garka,'
'Gildenstein = Alberan,' and 'Felwars = Keasriton' before reinforcements
arrive from the north, but the difficulty significantly decreases
afterward.

However, 'Kreschenta = Alberan' joins the northern army with a very high
probability, triggering the Alberinea-related event "Two Children of
Scorn." Then, along with the event "Raise the Princess's Banner,"
remnants revolt and become hostile. Therefore, it is necessary to raise
their affinity through interaction and prevent this beforehand.

Subsequently, as long as you protect the north and keep the happiness of
the two（※) high, you can expand your territory steadily, though some
might call it player cheating.

（※）A parameter of manpower units that triggers events such as
rebellions.  
Generally, it increases or decreases based on personality traits and
actions. However, in the case of the two, isolating and leaving them
alone somehow causes their happiness to rise beyond the maximum value
(possibly a bug), and they become completely harmless unless hostility
is triggered. When they appeared in some random event in this state,
their clothing was reportedly an apron dress (requires verification).

○Key Units in the Main Scenario

\* 'Krische = Christand'

  
Even on low difficulty, they crush you with overwhelming stats and
skills.  
However, the Heavenly Sword Krische on historical difficulty is
unmanageable. They increase tactical success rate regardless of the
situation and keep using the inherently low success rate 'Headhunting'
(※forces a duel, drastically lowers morale). Avoiding a battle with her
is the basic strategy against Alberan. Except for a few nations, discard
all options other than an allied victory in historical difficulty.

\* 'Kreschenta = Alberan'

After the succession event, if you give them time, they use their
overwhelming intellect and politics to gain a diplomatic advantage,
forcing a one-sided game. Due to the 'Trait: Alberan's Child of Scorn,'
giving them combat experience quickly turns them into a commander unit
rivaling their sister.

\* 'Bogan = Christand'

  
A commander with high standards in command, martial ability,
intelligence, and charm, except for politics. Since they possess too
many top-tier talents, a direct confrontation is extremely difficult
even without 'Krische = Christand'. However, conversely, if you can
eliminate them, you can suppress many talents at once.

\* 'Nozan = Verreich'

  
A top-tier commander surpassing even 'Bogan = Christand'. They are also
skilled in politics and become independent over time. Alberan, with them
at the forefront and several other top-tier talents, is extremely
dangerous even without the "Two Children of Scorn."

\* 'Dougleen = Garka'

The greatest enemy when isolating and eliminating the two Children of
Scorn.  
They are a top-tier commander unit, but despite their high charm, they
have a bad reputation, so use tricks to weaken them. Once reformed
during the succession event, they become an unbeatable strong enemy.

○Elsren Holy Empire Difficulty: ★★

Economic Power: 5 Military Power: 5 Technological Power: 4 Population:
5+ Manpower: 5

A nation that split from Alberan with a territory more than double its
size.  
A major power that contributed to the downfall of the superpower Alberan
and possesses much of Alberan's former territory.

With its tremendous economic power, population, and diverse troop types,
this nation is arguably the most powerful on the continent.

This nation conquered and subjugated territories as provinces and vassal
states, expanding its influence by spreading its state religion.  
However, the problem lies in the friction between the powerful Papacy
and the Emperor-led parliament.  
Despite outward appearances, many conflicts exist beneath the surface,
making it politically unstable.  
Furthermore, the gap between the rich and poor is severe, with
widespread corruption and decay within religious organizations.

With strong lordly power and a constant risk of rebellion, you need to
regularly wage wars to direct their discontent outwards.

Starting with unparalleled power and abundant manpower, it's a
precarious nation that could quickly find itself in dire straits if
domestic affairs are not carefully managed.

☆Recommended Troop Types

\* Nomadic Cavalry

  
With its vast territory, this nation has a variety of troop types,
making it possible to form armies that combine only the strengths of its
vassal states and provinces. This is precisely the strength that
overwhelms other countries. If we had to choose, it would be the nomadic
cavalry, a unique unit of the numerous nomadic factions within the
country.

Their horsemanship is unparalleled, and if the battlefield is a plain,
defeating most opponents with mounted disengagement is easy.

With the excellent abilities and large numbers of cavalry, utilizing
their mobility makes for an easy game. Whether to crush their nemesis
Alberan to the west or expand to the east, it shouldn't be difficult if
you use these effectively.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

This strong nation displays the terror of numerical superiority due to
its overwhelming power and population, and its nomadic cavalry boasts
unparalleled strength in plain battles.  
Therefore, a direct defeat is difficult. Fortunately, its stability is
low. By lowering stability further through intrigue, you can cause
frequent rebellions and aim for internal collapse.

Many nomadic peoples subjugated by Elsren exist in the southern part of
the empire.  
Subverting them is also an option. Elsren, despite its strength, has
logistical problems, and luckily, the morale and training of its troops
are unstable.  
By cleverly using nomadic cavalry to disrupt the rear, they are easy to
collapse and large armies can be defeated without frontal combat. When
using them, single-type formations are preferable.

However, their weakness is the lack of magic users.  
Remember that they are very fragile when caught in a melee.

In the early game, neglecting Elsren causes them to launch a holy war
against Alberan and suffer a major defeat.  
The problem is that this triggers the Alberinea-related event chain.
Prevent the holy war through direct force or intrigue, or bring about a
swift end to the war to prevent the Alberinea-related events from
progressing.  
'Krische is a Letter Carrier' occurs when the Christand army is deployed
and time passes from the start of the war while they are still alive,
increasing the probability.  
It occurs within three months.  
Despite its mild name, it's a virtual death sentence. If you can't
achieve a truce within that turn, 'Krische = Christand' will join the
already ferocious Christand army.

○Key Units in the Main Scenario

\* 'Aleha = Sarshenka'

A top-tier commander unit. Eventually, they grow even stronger, becoming
a top-tier commander rivaling 'Nozan = Verreich'. Eliminate them early
on.  
They are popular in Elsren and can be eliminated through intrigue. If
they leave, they go to Alberan and join the Christand army.  
Keeping them under control is ideal.

\* 'Aios = Ribasreve'

The eldest son of the Ribasreve family, one of the three great families.
They have high levels of intelligence, politics, and charm, and if they
become Emperor of Elsren, the corruption is eliminated, and stability
significantly increases.  
Fortunately, they lack martial ability, so take care of them through
intrigue early on.

\* 'Wols = Natrias'

The Emperor of the Elsren Holy Empire. A martial commander who excels in
command and martial ability, but on the battlefield, he overwhelms with
brute force and high stats.  
Avoid direct confrontation and use intrigue to trap him since he lacks
political ability.

\* 'Coloces = Fitzgard'

A very capable commander unit with high command, martial ability, and
charm.  
Ordinary armies are no match for him. Once they start a siege, it
becomes an impregnable fortress. Leave siege warfare to me!

○Elderant Kingdom Difficulty: ★★★★

Economic Power: 2 Military Power: 4 Technological Power: 2 Population: 3
Manpower: 4

A tribal confederation whose territory is mostly mountainous and
forested.

An aggregation of tribes once ruled by the Alberan Kingdom. While
calling itself a kingdom, it's closer to a tribal confederation.

Its territory is similar to Alberan's, and it possesses countless
mines.  
However, it has few plains, little suitable land for agriculture.  
Therefore, it often suffers from food shortages, has few cities besides
the capital, and a small economy.

Countless tribes live in a wide area, but their relationships are poor,
with tribes constantly fighting each other. Technologically, they are
inferior to their neighboring powers.

Overall, this is an outdated nation with deeply rooted old customs and
structures. However, its advantage lies in its mobilization capacity.

With a strong warrior ethos, every man, even a farmer, becomes a soldier
when armed, requiring no training to enter battle. Their primitive
lifestyle maintains their strength. Even though lightly armed, their
reckless charge, unafraid of arrows, instills fear in their enemies.

Despite its underdeveloped civilization, it possesses extremely high
potential and is a rewarding nation with the ability to change
significantly based on leadership.

☆Recommended Troop Types

\* Shortbowmen

  
Those living in the forest have many hunters, and many soldiers, while
fighting as light infantry, can switch to archers when armed with bows.

Shortbows are primarily used, so the range is limited, but their archery
skills are outstanding.  
Their arrows are precise even in the poor visibility of the forest.

Even in close combat, they can easily defeat equal numbers.  
In the forest, where forming ranks is difficult, they have a significant
advantage over the enemy.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

They are unparalleled in strength in forested areas, and conquering them
is an arduous task. In battle, lure them into the plains to reduce their
numbers significantly. Never engage in decisive battles or surprise
attacks in the forest.

As a warrior nation, despite their poor equipment, their military power
is tremendous, and their commander units generally have high martial
abilities. In forests, the 'Trait: Forest Bred' increases tactical
success rate and reduces that of the enemy. Unless there's a significant
difference in strength, it is important not to advance recklessly.

On the other hand, their average intelligence is low, so if they are
lured onto the plains, they become a mindless mob. They are easily
provoked, so they are easy to defeat when divided.  
Troop morale and training are high, making them strong in melee combat,
but their control (※formation maintenance ability directly related to
defense) is very low. An army with high control can defeat them through
brute force.

If you are careful, you can usually deal with them without problems.  
The problem is the territory. Almost entirely forested, occupation
requires massive bloodshed. In exchange, they conduct small-scale
plunder by border skirmishes. Keeping a buffer state is also a good
option.  
Burning down their territory is an option too, but expect to max out
your infamy.

Similar to Elsren, challenging Alberan to war may advance the
Alberan-related event chain, so pay attention to the movements of the
Christand army. 'Aurgoln = Hilkintos' will try to lure the Elderant army
out of the forest at the cost of territory, leading to a protracted war.
After the occurrence of 'Krische is a Letter Carrier,' there is a high
probability of 'Alberinea's Awakening'.

\*\*Main Scenario Units to Watch Out For\*\*

\* \*\*Shelna=Veze:\*\* The continent's strongest commander unit,
excluding the two from Alberan.  
While her father is also talented, his illness prevents him from going
to war, making her the de facto supreme commander of Elderant. If she
interacts with Krische=Cristando or Kreschenta=Alberan during the
queen's coronation, Elderant will become a vassal state of Alberan, so
be careful. Try to attach her to your country through diplomacy.

\* \*\*Toba=Akaz:\*\* An extremely powerful commander, but also a
versatile unit with political skill, charm, and popularity. Ideal as the
next king candidate to stabilize Elderant. Small-scale looting that
continues even during a truce disappears, and proper diplomacy is
conducted, so try not to kill her.

\* \*\*Gain=Miklea:\*\* A forest-specialized commander who is the master
of forested areas.  
When a forest area is the battlefield, even if you throw twice the
military might, you cannot be assured of victory.  
The death of King Golkista=Veze immediately triggers a civil war, so use
this to your advantage.

\*\*Garshann Republic  
Difficulty: ★\*\*

Economic Power: 5  
Military Power: 4  
Technology: 3  
Population: 4  
Personnel: 4

A multi-ethnic nation possessing vast lands in the southern part of the
Alberan Kingdom. It was once a vassal state of Alberan, but declared
independence when Alberan was weakened by its split with Elsren.  
The southern part of its territory is largely desert and wasteland, but
regular heavy rains in the highlands and the resulting floods deposit
rich soil along the rivers, resulting in an unparalleled wheat harvest.
The name Garshann itself originates from these annual life-giving rains;
Garshann means "heavy rain."  
They have a unique religion called the Rain Worshiping Cult.  
They have long utilized their abundant wheat production, forming land
and sea trade agreements with various parts of the continent, allowing
many different races to engage in commerce.  
It is a prosperous trading nation, and since transitioning to a
republic, it has maintained internal stability without chaos.  
Whether to take out Alberan and Elsren first, or ignore them and expand
– there are many options, and none are particularly difficult.

\*\*Recommended Unit Type:\*\*

\* \*\*Beast Soldiers:\*\*  
They have accepted numerous ethnic groups and incorporated various
cultures, most notably the military use of beasts. They have acquired
beasts used in various regions, learned their techniques, and
domesticated a variety of beasts like horses. The existence of beast
soldiers is a testament to their ability to encounter and crush any
culture, absorbing everything without waste – beasts are inherently
stronger than humans, and if used properly, they cannot be defeated
head-on.  
Formations, tactics, and combat techniques are ultimately designed for
fighting humans. Beast soldiers instill terror in their enemies, capable
of plunging them into chaos with a single move.

\* \*\*Alcazaris:\*\* A single domesticated elephant beast at the start
of the main scenario.  
Simply having it accompany the army will halve the enemy's morale, and
deal significant damage to enemy control during a charge. It also acts
as a fortress when attacked, significantly reducing your losses.
However, it’s not invincible, so be careful when facing siege weapons,
high-power commanders, or accompanying units.  
Absolutely do not let it face Krische=Cristando; an event will trigger,
maximizing their morale while halving yours.

\*\*Main Scenario Countermeasures:\*\*

Garshann is exceptionally wealthy due to various mines and trade ports;
it can collapse a small country with economic pressure alone.  
Its population and military power are also very high. If Alberan
stagnates, Garshann might significantly expand, potentially becoming the
largest nation on the continent without notice.  
The post-revolution republic has high stability, making it resistant to
rebellion.

However, its republican system leads to slow decision-making, and its
multi-ethnic nature makes espionage relatively easy, allowing you to
easily obtain internal information on invasions or troop deployments.
Use this to your advantage. While soldier equipment and training are
average, a high probability of beast soldiers being included makes the
Garshann army very strong in direct combat. If your commander's
leadership, strategy, and troop morale are low, they could be instantly
routed.  
Luring them in and disrupting their rear to lower their morale before
battle is the proper approach, but be aware that camel cavalry, a
counter to cavalry, may be protecting their supply trains. Also, large
beast soldiers cannot be used in forested areas, so targeting those
areas is also a good option.

They possess many large ships due to their enormous economic power, but
these are primarily transport ships.  
While not low-performing, they're not overwhelming. Attacking them at
sea is an option, but they generally operate in large fleets, making it
difficult unless you have a significant advantage. Be wary of surprise
attacks, as they can transport beasts if they have access to
short-distance routes or large, stable ports.

\*\*Main Scenario Units to Watch Out For\*\*

\* \*\*Allgan:\*\* A commander unit comparable to Alberan's famed
general, Dougleen=Garka.  
Their abilities are similar, with Allgan slightly inferior in strategy
but superior in popularity.  
Unlike Dougleen, who is purely a military figure, Allgan possesses
extremely high political skills, making him a versatile unit that should
be eliminated before he becomes the chairman.

\* \*\*Zalvag:\*\* A commander unit with continent-class military might.
He possesses the "Headhunter" trait, which increases the success rate of
headhunting attacks.  
Like Krische=Cristando, he can continuously perform headhunting attacks
even on plains.

\* \*\*Elkarl:\*\* A commander unit with high leadership, military
power, and charm despite a lack of strategy. Compensating for his
strategic weakness with overwhelming force utilizing the potential of
beast soldiers. Avoid direct confrontation.

\*\*Arna Empire  
Difficulty: ★★★★★\*\*

Economic Power: 3  
Military Power: 3  
Technology: 5  
Population: 2  
Personnel: 2

A maritime nation located north of Alberan. It has a long-standing
alliance with Alberan. Surrounded by mines to the east and west, and the
sea to the north, its location fostered its metalworking and
shipbuilding technologies, making it a technologically advanced nation.
Despite its small size, it has a very high economic power through
maritime trade, and the large quantities of high-quality magic crystals
mined there make its magic crystal processing technology the best on the
continent, comprising much of its exports. However, its limited land
area makes the formation of large armies impossible, and to the south
lies its ally, Alberan. While its location is excellent for defense,
land invasion is difficult. It possesses a powerful navy, suggesting a
sea invasion; however, this too presents significant challenges.

A government that strongly emphasizes the worship of Holy Spirits,
leading to a theocratic system.  
Its government, which values stability and harmony through faith, finds
it difficult to engage in acts of aggression, meaning that if you want
to ravage other countries, you must first change this from within.

\*\*Recommended Unit Type:\*\*

\* \*\*Crossbowmen/Heavy Crossbowmen:\*\* They successfully disassembled
and improved the crossbows obtained through maritime trade from the far
east, making ranged attacks heavily reliant on crossbowmen.  
While crossbows are inferior to bows in terms of firing interval, they
are primarily direct fire, have a shorter effective range, and are more
complex and costly than bows, they require no training, and their high
power and accuracy at medium range more than compensate for these
drawbacks. There is no better weapon if you focus on defense and not on
invasion. In Arna, both young and old are regularly trained in the use
of crossbows, meaning that the entire population is a potential pool of
crossbowmen, fitting well with Arna's characteristics of a small
population, high economic power, and high technological level. Even in
field battles, they can use superior quality, large-scale repeating
crossbows and catapults built by skilled engineers, making their battles
unique.  
These can, of course, also be used for sieges and invasions, and their
technology alone has the potential to conquer the surrounding world.

\*\*Main Scenario Countermeasures:\*\*

When aiming to defeat Alberan from the sea, breaking through Arna is
essential, but the problem lies in the quality of their world-class
naval power. The existence of Alberan, protecting it from inland
threats, allows them to invest their economic power into an overwhelming
fleet, effectively controlling the vast maritime area in the north of
the continent. If considering a short war, employ a deceptive attack to
weaken their fleet. Fortunately, the quality of their ground forces is
not very high, equipment aside, meaning that if you can establish a
beachhead, you can overwhelm them with superior force.  
However, they will choose to besiege rather than fight in open battles,
so you need to prepare a large number of siege weapons or risk
significant losses of troops and time. If the war drags on, Krische will
arrive as reinforcements, triggering the “Krische is a Letter Carrier”
event.

\*\*Main Scenario Units to Watch Out For:\*\*

\* \*\*Priestess Princess:\*\* A commander unit with low military power
but a balanced set of other skills. She commands the defense of Naut
Arna, the capital, so prepare a commander accordingly.

\* \*\*Cornelia:\*\* The sea goddess Cornelia becomes a top-tier naval
commander. With leadership, strategy, and charm, leading Arna’s fleet,
she is virtually unstoppable. Take out her ship before she rises to
power. Her father, Alto Neris, is also a threat.

\*\*Kreisharana Difficulty: ××\*\*

Economic Power: 1  
Military Power: 3  
Technology: 1  
Population: 1-  
Personnel: 4

Descendants of once glorious warriors.  
They once ruled a vast area in the north of the kingdom, but after
losing a war with Alberan, they now live in seclusion in the Albyager
mountains in the northwest of the kingdom.  
They maintain an extremely strict warrior society with strong
traditional customs. Men undergo extremely rigorous combat training from
a young age. Therefore, even men who usually farm or craft household
goods are capable of overwhelming trained soldiers of other countries
the moment they pick up a spear. The immediate threat of magical beasts
and the austere, harsh environment have honed their warrior skills, and
considering the average ability of their soldiers, they are among the
best on the continent.  
However, the problem is their population. While they can mobilize an
extraordinary number of troops relative to their population, their total
military strength does not exceed 1500.  
Their Griffin Knights number less than 100, making any invasion of other
countries hopeless.  
While their strong soldiers could be overwhelmed by sheer numbers if
invaded.  
Alberan has not attacked due to a previously established Holy Spirit
Covenant and non-aggression treaty, but they are now slowly headed
toward extinction. Perhaps serving the Holy Spirit that once helped them
and heading towards extinction is their desired path.

\*\*Recommended Unit Type:\*\*

\* \*\*Griffin Knights:\*\*  
Aside from the individual skills of the soldiers, the griffins they
train and ride are remarkable. This five-foot-tall beast, with large
wings, a bird's beak and a lion's body, can freely soar through the air,
allowing the Griffin Knights to create a new axis in planar warfare.
Flanking maneuvers by cavalry have always been strong, but there are
many countermeasures. However, no army can counter these aerial flanking
maneuvers, and the warriors who ride them are the most elite. A surprise
attack can deliver a fatal blow to a large army.  
It is safe to say that the key to victory for these few is the Griffin
Knights.

\*\*Main Scenario Countermeasures:\*\*

They are essentially reclusive and harmless. However, attacking them
will reveal a hellish scene where a ten-thousand-strong army is defeated
by a mere thousand, so be careful.  
They are exceptionally strong, so expect at least a 1:20 casualty ratio.
Griffin Knights increase the success rate of headhunting attacks even
beyond Black Flag Special Ops.  
Also, interfering with Yagelnaus may not only destroy their army but
could lead to the immediate destruction of their capital, so do not
provoke them.

\*\*Main Scenario Units to Watch Out For:\*\*

\* \*\*Vinsril=Sharana:\*\* A commander with top-tier continental-level
military power and charm, and the "Great Warrior" trait.  
He is an impossible unit with a high headhunting success rate; be sure
to have a commander who can counter him militarily.

\* \*\*Alkylens=Sharana:\*\* Similar to Vinsril, but with superior charm
and popularity, resulting in even higher troop morale.  
Avoid direct combat; the strength of the already powerful Kreisharana
soldiers is amplified, making ordinary soldiers ineffective.

\* \*\*Other units with the "Great Warrior" trait:\*\*  
This is a superior version of the "Air Warrior" trait. All of them are
top-tier continental-level commander units. Starting with "Velvas," they
perform headhunting attacks regardless of being surrounded; be careful.

\*\*Kuslan Kingdom Difficulty: ★★★★★\*\*

Economic Power: 2  
Military Power: 3  
Technology: 3  
Population: 2  
Personnel: 2

Like Garshann, it was once a vassal state of Alberan and declared
independence during the Elsren split.  
It is the leader of a small state alliance south of Elderant and west of
Garshann, having maintained its sovereignty for two hundred years while
adjacent to the powerful Garshann.  
It is adept at diplomacy, skillfully navigating between Alberan and
Garshann, ignoring criticism of its opportunistic diplomacy.  
It is hostile towards Elderant, joining Garshann’s side in the
Garshann-Elderant war at the start of the main scenario.  
It is not a prominent nation, making initial expansion difficult, but
its position as the alliance leader and location offer the potential for
continental domination, depending on the starting era, making it an
interesting choice in the game.

\*\*Recommended Unit Type:\*\*

\* \*\*Longbowmen:\*\* They use highly trained longbowmen as their main
force; their archery tactics are impressive.  
They are diligently training skirmishers who can gain an advantage
against Garshann’s beast soldiers, making them very strong against
Garshann, but their melee combat ability is mediocre.

\*\*Main Scenario Countermeasures:\*\*

While not easily defeated, they are not particularly threatening if you
can bring your full force to bear. The problem is that Garshann and
Elderant, who could directly fight Kuslan, may lack the necessary
resources. The key is to avoid their interference while gaining the
upper hand in the war between the five major nations.

\*\*Main Scenario Units to Watch Out For:\*\*

\* \*\*Clause=Kuslan:\*\* A cunning Kuslan hero.  
Eliminating this king's brother will demoralize Kuslan and easily shift
the advantage, but he is a strategist who excels at protracted and
defensive wars, making him difficult to eliminate.

\*\*Current Kingdom Difficulty: ★★★★★\*\*

Economic Power: 3  
Military Power: 3  
Technology: 4  
Population: 2  
Personnel: 2

A small nation ruling Wezarius’ Fang and its surroundings, including
Galgain.  
It has long controlled the strategic crossroads between east and west,
acting as a shield against invasions from the former superpower Alberan
and Elsren from the east, holding strong authority in the east.  
It possesses multiple ports, and despite its small territory and
population, it has a strong economy, investing its funds into building
the Galgain Wall, famous as the longest and strongest wall in the world.

The Current King has historically been the leader of the Eastern
Alliance under the Wezarius Agreement, mediating wars in the east.  
While the eastern nations outwardly respected Current, its authority
waned after the end of the Wise King Wezarius’s reign, increasing
corruption and leading to the loss of leadership to the Gerganic Kingdom
before reunification.

In the main scenario, it is one of the most difficult nations to
survive.  
Allying with either the east or west will lead to its destruction in the
unification war. If you play, the “Two Reines” scenario, set during the
Wise King Wezarius's reign, is recommended.  
Its strategic location gives it the potential for continental
domination.

★Recommended Troop Type

○Large Weapons

This nation, a land of craftsmen with excellent engineers, significantly
surpasses other countries in terms of weapon quality and quantity.  
These weapons, mass-produced during the fortification process, have
undergone significant improvements in range, power, and rate of fire,
making them incredibly powerful in defensive battles. They can easily be
converted into siege weapons, becoming a significant asset if you look
outward early in the game.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

Fortifications are widespread, including Galgain's Wall and those in
various cities, making direct assaults difficult.  
Targeting Current requires careful consideration: attacking from the
east necessitates securing surrounding nations first, while a western
approach requires adequate preparation.  
Fortunately, Current in the main scenario lacks superior commander
units, making it conquerable with sufficient forces.

○Units to Watch Out For in the Main Scenario

・None.

○Gerganik Kingdom  
Difficulty: ★★★

Economic Power: 4  
Military Power: 5  
Technology: 4  
Population: 4  
Personnel: 4

A major power controlling the northwest region of the eastern continent,
comparable in size to Alberan.  
Descendants of the Lushelan Empire, which once ruled the entire eastern
continent, they protect the small northwestern nation of Hutaria Holy
Spirit Kingdom, sharing a common origin.  
Although the imperial capital was transformed into Lushelan Lake and
much of the land burned during the calamity of the magic dragon, some
areas remained unscathed, allowing for the kingdom’s resurgence under a
new name.

The Lushelan Empire originated from a nomadic equestrian people who
thrived on the plains; the Gerganik Kingdom follows suit.  
Possessing numerous regions known for fine horses, its army is centered
around cavalry, earning it the title of a knightly nation.

Blessed with abundant crops, minerals, and livestock, the nation is
self-sufficient, making it the most stable in the east. This stability
and abundance form the foundation of its powerful military, making it a
prime candidate for eastern unification.  
As long as you attack without hesitation, you can win conflicts between
nations.

Possessing excellent personnel, particularly in terms of the quantity
and quality of commanders, it ranks among the continent's best.  
Its distance from Alberan makes continental unification in the main
scenario impossible; however, it's the easiest to unify in the east in
other difficulty settings. However, due to its aggressive national
policy, a victorious alliance with Alberan in a historical difficulty
setting is extremely difficult.

★Recommended Troop Type

○Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry

These two types of cavalry are the mainstays of the Gerganik Kingdom.  
Fast light breeds from the south and strong heavy breeds from the north
are used strategically. Utilizing them for cavalry charges from the rear
and flanks, or for disrupting the enemy rear, will provide an
advantage.  
Both are highly skilled, with the heavy cavalry’s equipment alone
outclassing that of other nations.

Young nobles, regardless of social standing, traditionally begin their
military careers in the cavalry, possessing a high rate of magic users
and are highly skilled. Nearly all receive tactical training, making
them elite troops with the highest combat capabilities when operating
independently. Their mastery of cavalry tactics makes them among the top
five in the continent in open field battles.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

The strongest nation in the east, its national strength and military
power rival Alberan’s, except for its personnel.  
Its personnel significantly exceed the average national standard,
guaranteeing a very difficult battle.

Allowing Gerganik to choose the battlefield will likely lead to defeat
for any eastern nation; instead, lure them into an ambush, weaken their
forces, and then engage.  
Fighting in forests reduces their effectiveness, making it preferable to
draw them there.

While their cavalry is particularly strong, their military isn't
invincible; a direct confrontation will undoubtedly result in a tough
battle.  
The "King's Army," led by Alfmaz Gerganik, is the finest in the east,
guaranteeing defeat in a head-on engagement with equal numbers. Exercise
extreme caution when fighting them, avoiding any large-scale frontal
assaults.

○Units to Watch Out For in the Main Scenario

・Alfmaz Gerganik

The top commander unit in the east, possessing top-tier command
abilities. His skills are among the strongest, comparable to those of
Alberan's top commanders; his political acumen also gives him an
advantage in negotiations. Eliminate him as early as possible.

・Olivarus Gerganik

Possesses similar stats to his father, Alfmaz Gerganik, albeit slightly
weaker. His high growth potential necessitates elimination before he
becomes too strong. Other princes are unremarkable, so eliminating them
is highly beneficial.

・Triskes Savak

One of the Gerganik Kingdom's renowned generals.  
While not exceptionally strong in combat, his leadership and strategy
surpass Alfmaz's, resulting in a high tactical success rate.  
Never underestimate him, even with fewer troops.

○Toran Tribal Confederation  
Difficulty: ★★★★

Economic Power: 2  
Military Power: 4  
Technology: 2  
Population: 3  
Personnel: 3

One of the three major powers in the southern part of the eastern
continent. A nomadic confederation controlling the vast southern plains,
they subjugate and rule numerous small nations built by agrarian
peoples. They believe that an agrarian lifestyle weakens their strength,
maintaining their nomadic lifestyle as they have for hundreds of years.

Despite their inferior economic and technological capabilities, they are
a strong tribal nation where almost every male is a warrior, with
nomadic cavalry forming the core of their military.  
Their mobility and information dissemination speed are unprecedented,
providing a strategic advantage.  
Though their numbers are limited, tens of thousands of nomadic cavalry
can easily defeat a much larger force if used effectively.

They can also draw upon the military strength of multiple subjugated
nations, boasting a considerable infantry force and a few siege weapons,
making their invasion capabilities more than sufficient. They maintain
friendly relations with surrounding smaller nations based on military
might, with tributes as their primary source of income.

They maintain a strong antagonism toward the Gerganik Kingdom, but due
to their proximity to the Sui Empire in the east, they are preoccupied
with minor skirmishes.  
They are slightly disadvantaged against the Sui Empire due to the
difference in national power.  
Conversely, the Sui Empire holds a superior position.

A highly refined nomadic tribal confederation with exceptional
potential.

★Recommended Troop Type

○Nomadic Cavalry

Their horsemanship is unparalleled, with their light cavalry and light
mounted archers possessing overwhelming skill. In plains battles, they
can defeat most opponents solely through ranged attacks from horseback.
Only the Gerganik Kingdom in the east can match them; if you can handle
their cavalry, you'll have no other enemies in the east's mostly flat
terrain.

The advantage of having tens of thousands of cavalry as their main
force, rather than infantry, is significant, giving them a great
advantage in battles outside of forests or sieges. However, the key is
conserving their main forces and winning in such battles.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

Granting the nomadic cavalry free rein will likely result in defeat. The
key is to restrict their freedom and secure key points.  
Their scattered settlements are their weak points; attack them,
accepting losses, to limit their options. Focus on interrogating
prisoners to obtain information. Due to their tribal nature, significant
defeats lead to a loss of authority (affecting the loyalty of
subordinate nations and tribes, particularly influential in tribal
confederations), causing them to become fractured.

○Units to Watch Out For in the Main Scenario

・Sardo Toran

The Toran chief, possessing high leadership and strategic skills, making
him a formidable opponent when commanding nomadic cavalry. Although his
charisma is not low, his notoriety is high, so using intrigue to create
discord among his subordinates is a viable strategy.

・Rafael Ziga

The king of a small nation that has long been subordinate to the
Toran.  
A commander with military prowess, leadership, and strategy, he is
undefeated in siege warfare, earning him the moniker "Destroyer of a
Hundred Cities." His "Hundred Cities Breaker" trait enhances his
tactical success rate in siege and siege defense battles, making open
field battles preferable.  
Gain a strategic advantage before engaging him.

○Sui Empire  
Difficulty: ★★★★

Economic Power: 4  
Military Power: 5  
Technology: 4  
Population: 5+  
Personnel: 4

One of the three major powers located at the easternmost point of the
eastern continent.  
Possessing fertile land and a long coastline, it has the largest
territory and population in the eastern continent.  
Although not as powerful as Elsren, its national strength is
exceptionally high, making it arguably the strongest nation in the
east.  
However, it is plagued by constant internal strife, facing civil war
every few years.  
Misjudgment can lead to national collapse in the face of external
threats.

Conversely, it has accumulated significant military expertise, boasting
impressive training and military technology.  
The quality of its commanders is high; if unified, conquering the east
would not be difficult.

The emperor in the main scenario, while not incompetent, is mediocre. If
aiming for unification, replace him early.

Like Gerganik, its distance from Alberan in a historical difficulty
setting makes continental unification impossible; however, unlike
Gerganik, a victorious alliance is comparatively easier to achieve.

★Recommended Troop Type

○Crossbowmen, Heavy Crossbowmen

Their crossbows, refined for efficient use of conscripted troops,
instantly transform civilians into soldiers. While lacking in range and
rate of fire compared to bows, their mid-range power is comparable, with
their easy-to-train troops and sheer numbers as their strength.

Though not as skilled as trained archers, such troops are not infinitely
available.  
If you defeat them today, you can wear them down over the next year or
ten years. Their vast human resources allow them to eventually surpass
their enemy in numbers, a king's battle tactic that guarantees victory
against any adversary.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

Stimulating them could unify them; thus, a better approach is to use
intrigue to cause division. Engaging the Sui's seemingly endless
manpower in a direct confrontation risks exhaustion before victory. If
engaging them, aim for a swift victory through overwhelming force, as
Alberan did during the unification war.

Their division negates their plentiful manpower and talent, removing the
need for fear.

○Units to Watch Out For in the Main Scenario

・Ra Sinfha

A commander with continental-level military strength. While his
leadership and strategy are average, his powerful personal guard, known
as the "Thunderbolt," and the "Headhunter" trait allow him to employ
"Headhunting" tactics aggressively.  
Exercise caution, especially in forested areas where his tactical
success rate increases.

・Lu Zen

The Sui Empire's most brilliant strategist, possessing superior
leadership and strategy. His other abilities are above average, making
him a potential threat equal to, or even greater than, Sinfha.

・Liu Roulai

The Sui Empire's first prince, though young at the start of the main
scenario. He grows into a capable ruler, making a unified Sui Empire the
strongest in the east; eliminate him early.

○Scrif Kingdom  
Difficulty: ××

Economic Power: 2  
Military Power: 3  
Technology: 3  
Population: 1+  
Personnel: 3

Located southwest of the continent, bordering the Current Kingdom,
surrounded by the Toran Tribal Confederation to the east and the
Gerganik Kingdom to the north, it has maintained its sovereignty for a
long time.  
All cities built in the Great Forest are fortified.  
Despite its size, it has plentiful personnel, consistently boasting
excellent commanders regardless of era.

Its commanders all possess the "Forest Raised" trait, significantly
enhancing their combat capabilities in forests.  
This provides an advantage against larger nations in their own
territory, but this alone will lead to eventual defeat. The key to
survival is to read the situation and avoid unnecessary battles.  
The focus in battle should be efficiency, minimizing losses while
forcing the enemy's retreat.  
Survival in Scrif requires exceptionally delicate maneuvering.

★Recommended Troop Type

○Light Infantry

Light infantry specialized for forest combat. In forests, they surpass
regular light infantry, significantly reducing fatigue during all
actions. However, with very few heavy infantry, light infantry form the
core of Scrif's army.  
Their advantages are lost in melee combat; if facing a better-equipped
enemy, they are easily crushed.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

They generally remain within their territory unless attacked and can be
ignored.  
An attack is best timed for the end of eastern unification, when
expanding westward.  
Berzadia Nitrias is a top-tier commander, overwhelmingly powerful in
forest battles and with high popularity significantly increasing his
troops' abilities.  
If you don't mind the repercussions, burn the forest down.

They are relatively amenable to negotiation and readily accept
non-aggression proposals, making avoidance a viable option.  
They tend to oppose aggression against the Current Kingdom; therefore,
instigating discord between them beforehand is beneficial.

○Units to Watch Out For in the Main Scenario

・Berzadia Nitrias

A top-tier commander, nicknamed the "God of War."  
He single-handedly defends Scrif's territory and sovereignty, easily
defeating even twice his number in forest battles. To fight him, prepare
a commander with comparable abilities and sufficient forces.

○Hutaria Holy Spirit Kingdom  
Difficulty: ×

Economic Power: 1  
Military Power: 3  
Technology: 2  
Population: 2  
Personnel: 3

A nation founded by descendants of the once-glorious Lushelan Empire.  
Its capital is built in the foothills leading to Dogaruazu, where the
magic dragon sleeps, and it declares a policy of self-defense.  
With a high proportion of magic users and the ability to train and ride
the giant blue eagles inhabiting the mountains, it shares similarities
with Craycharana, though less extreme and more akin to a standard
nation.

Despite its small population, its soldiers are highly skilled,
possessing numerous Blue Eagle Riders, earning them recognition in the
east.

Legends of past arrogance incurring the dragon's wrath still persist,
forbidding extravagance.  
Despite its excellent location, abundant in high-quality magic crystals,
its economy is not thriving, and its processing technology lags behind.

Conquering the continent requires overcoming these domestic issues,
making it a difficult nation to manage, though survival is not overly
challenging.

★Recommended Troop Type

○Blue Eagle Riders

These giant blue-feathered eagles were once feared as harbingers of
death.  
Arrows cannot pierce them, and those who ride them are equally
formidable.

Like Lion Griffon Riders, their ability to bypass enemy lines from above
renders formations useless. The elite riders significantly increase the
success rate of "Headhunting," potentially enabling a comeback even
against a larger force by eliminating the enemy commander.

△Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

Similar to Craycharana in the "King Bazalishe" scenario, consider them a
strong nation with skilled troops and aerial cavalry.  
They declare self-defense and will not attack unless provoked.  
Maintaining friendly relations can result in alliances through
agreements like the Wezarius Pact.

If aiming for destruction, ensure high-combat units as commanders or
guards, and prepare for "Headhunting."  
They lack fortified cities, making their conquest relatively
straightforward.

However, avoid interfering with Dogaruazu; the magic dragon is a literal
magic dragon; attempts to interact with it risk national ruin, or even
turning the entire continent to ashes.

○Units to Watch Out For in the Main Scenario

・Cotloose

A commander with continental-level military strength.  
While lacking in strategy and charisma, his high martial skills and
"Heavenly Winged Knight" unit enable him to focus on "Headhunting,"
making him a dangerous opponent.

Other units possessing the 'Celestial Wing Knight' trait

While inferior to Kreisharana's in terms of military strength and
'Headhunting' success rate, they are numerous.  
Because they are often flanked and attacked from behind by tactics such
as 'Back Drop', a commander who possesses both military strength and
intellect is desirable.

○ Toushou Country  
Difficulty: ★★★★★

Economic Power: 3  
Military Power: 4  
Technological Power: 4  
Population: 3  
Personnel: 4

A nation that rules an island located to the east of the continent.  
Essentially detached from the continental wars, it is constantly
embroiled in internal conflict, achieving unique technological and
cultural advancements.

Despite much of its land being covered in forests, it is a rich land,
particularly blessed with mineral deposits. However, it is prone to
natural disasters, frequently suffering damage from storms, volcanic
eruptions, and earthquakes.

Because of this, the mountainous and forested terrain leads to a high
ratio of magic users, resulting in high-quality soldiers.  
While coveted by the continent for its abundant resources, Toushou has
maintained its sovereignty and spun a long history.

Considering continental expansion, its uniquely evolved technology makes
it difficult to adapt to battles fought on vast plains. However, by
focusing development on coastlines and other island nations, a
victorious alliance with Alberan is possible.  
If continental dominance is conceded, securing an alliance with Alberan
wouldn't be particularly difficult.

★ Recommended Troop Type

○ Heavily Armored Bow Cavalry

A special cavalry unit that mounts heavily armed warriors on sturdy
horses, but whose main weapon is the longbow.  
Since most riders are magic-wielding warriors, the direct shot of a
longbow at close range becomes a virtually unavoidable attack. Compared
to continental nations, they specialize in mountain and forest combat.  
Strategic flanking maneuvers using horses are difficult to avoid, giving
them a significant advantage as long as the battle takes place within
their own territory.

△ Countermeasures in the Main Scenario

Impassable obstacles are everywhere, and its isolation from the
continent makes it difficult to obtain geographical and other
information. Fortunately, there is little chance of them attacking the
continent, but attacking them will be extremely difficult.

While resembling a tribal confederation, they possess strong caution and
hostility toward continentals, making division difficult. They will
resist invasion as one, ignoring the Holy Spirit Covenant. Even if
captured, they cannot be trusted, and if they escape, they will
continuously attempt ambushes.  
They can be described as culturally and technologically advanced,
uncivilized tribes that do not shy away from cruelty.  
Causing casualties significantly lowers morale on your side.  
There is no other option than to eliminate them completely, although the
rewards are significant, considerable hardship must be anticipated.

Even after negotiations with the Emperor, there is a high probability of
rebellion, leading to the overthrow of the nation and a complete
restart.  
Negotiations are best carried out only after eliminating dissidents.

○ Units to Watch Out For in the Main Scenario

・'Kazuma = Fujisai'

A commander unit with continental-class military strength. While lacking
in leadership, he possesses high intelligence and, despite average
charm, enjoys high popularity. His 'Trait: Eastern Sword Saint' means
units with the 'Trait: Warrior' trait are highly likely to accept a duel
with him.  
Refusing also increases the amount of popularity and morale decrease,
while increasing Fujisai's popularity and morale. Since it's a gamble,
it's generally better to use a commander without the 'Trait: Warrior'
trait and overwhelm him with numbers.

・'Azumano = Masanobu'

Toushou's strongest commander unit. He possesses all the necessary
abilities of a commander at a high level and serves as the supreme
commander of Toushou.  
He is ambitious and will plot a coup d'état if the Emperor decides to
submit to a continental nation, so caution is necessary.

・'The Fifteenth Toushoutei'

The ruler of Toushou, gifted in intelligence, politics, and charm. While
a more capable ruler than his predecessor, his low military strength
makes him unpopular in the warrior culture of Toushou.  
He actively acquires information from the continent, making him less
likely to fall for unfavorable negotiations. Fortunately, he is still a
child at the start, so ideally he should be eliminated before he gains
real power.

↓Since there are many questions about strength, here's a comparison
chart.  
Those who dislike this kind of thing might want to skip it.

■ Strength Comparison

This is fairly rough and vague, so consider it an estimate only.

Based on lethality. First encounter. Distance of twenty ken. No cover.  
Fully armed. Magic excluded. Escape impossible.  
Elderly characters are at their prime.

○ \> ○ is roughly 6:4.

If the ranks are different, it's almost impossible to win a one-on-one
fight.

However, if they are of the same rank, there's still a non-zero chance
of winning even if they are far apart (the atmosphere of the situation
can make the difference).

※Has a particularly strong first encounter killing attribute due to
skill, experience, and thinking ability.

They can easily win against opponents who are superior in overall
ability by lulling them into a sense of security, but of course, there
are varying strengths and weaknesses.

If they are of the same rank and it's a first encounter, they generally
have the advantage, but against those who never let their guard down
(like Nyan Nyan), they are only as strong as their abilities. However,
such people are rare.

Berry, who was seriously training to kill Roland for a time, is actually
quite strong (Assassin Berry).

Granmeld, Nakirus, and Elkarl are specialized in fighting against
groups, so their evaluation is somewhat disadvantaged under these
conditions.  
Lightly armed people are also generally at a disadvantage.  
If you assume no armor, the strength changes considerably (Tetsufusa and
Kilrea, etc.).

The strength of 翠虎 lies in its stealth and speed as a wild animal,
allowing it to ambush and hunt even monster-class opponents, but its
inherent abilities are around this level.

Jaragasya, in its later form, due to the lazy improvements by Krische,
had a learning function (!) and an automatic synchronization function
implemented, but automatic synchronization ended with the end of the
unification war.

However, the learning function remains, and around the end of the Klein
Mail period, some had become monster-class.

In terms of ranking, monsters are still monsters, and superhumans are
still superhumans.

Generally speaking, people who fall into group 3 are those with
extremely rare talent or those who have been blessed with luck and
accumulated vast experience.

For most people, it requires a grueling amount of effort to reach group
4.  
Those who enter this group are extremely powerful in military terms
(even a general who rose from the ranks of a common soldier is in this
group), but due to the nature of the story, named characters are often
in groups 2 and 3.

This is due to narrative bias.
