## Chapter 148: Hand in Hand

Ellie sat up and turned to Letty.

"I'm back, Letty-san."

The moment she heard that voice, Letty ran over and embraced her.

It felt incredibly long. The time spent waiting for the procedure to
finish and enduring a sense of anxiety and impatience she couldn't
explain. It was over. It had finished safely. The instant Letty
understood this, her body moved on its own.

"Whoa! L-Letty-san?"

"You’re back, you’re back, Ellie..."

Letty herself didn’t know why she was so anxious. She just hugged Ellie
tightly. She pressed close to confirm the softness of her body. To
confirm her presence was right there. To confirm this was the Ellie she
knew so well.

"Ahnn... Letty-san, that's a bit too passionate."

Ellie returned the embrace nevertheless. Her arms were trembling
slightly too.

\*\*\*

And after a while… Eventually, they both eased their embrace.

"I'm sorry, I somehow... felt like you weren't going to come back."

"Fufu, I'm fine. But I'm happy you worried about me."

They looked into each other's eyes from a close distance. Letty wore a
rare, timid expression, and Ellie had her usual smile.

With a suddenly mischievous look, Ellie reached out her arm.

Letty watched, wondering what she was going to do, as Ellie touched her
hair and gave her head a ruffling, ticklish stroke.

"Whoa, eh, Ellie, what's with the sudden affection?"

"Ehehe, it's nothing."

*It's okay. It's okay.*

The words she had been telling herself, she now instilled into Letty
through her fingertips. As she did so, the ticklish expression on
Letty's face gradually softened.

*Ah.*

*There.*

*Something I can do with my own hands.*

Even if she was a weapon, even if she was a tool. Even if her hands were
stained with blood. If there was someone who would accept them….

"Hey, Letty-san. Can I kiss you?"

"Eh... well, yes, you can, but..."

The sudden question made Letty suspicious. *Oh, wait a minute,* Ellie
realized, but chose not to mention it.

"Then, I'm going to. Please close your eyes."

"Uh, Uh-huh..."

Seeing Letty squeeze her eyes shut, a smile naturally blossomed on
Ellie's face.

*So cute.*

The cutest, most adorable person in the world.

She was a former assassin and a master swordswoman, yet she closed her
eyes so readily in front of Ellie, a weapon. She trusted her. She
exposed herself to her.

So, Ellie would trust and commit herself as well.

She stood on her tiptoes, measured the distance, and closed her eyes.

A soft, grazing peck.

"Mmm... I feel kind of embarrassed..."

Letty's expression as they separated was too cute, so Ellie hugged her
again. Why was this person so adorable?

"Fufu, is it because this is the first time *I've* kissed you?"

"Ugh, I wish you hadn't said that..."

It was a fresh reaction, different from usual. But the same comfortable
closeness as usual.

"I love the usual cool Letty-san, but this cute Letty-san is nice too."

"I'm not c-cute at all."

"Yes, you are, you're super, super cute."

"Honestly, Ellie!"

She sounded angry, yet also a bit sulky. But it was also a voice that
made it clear she wasn't truly upset.

This was their usual distance.

This was their usual exchange.

*I am still myself.*

*Letty-san is still Letty-san.*

She repeated these thoughts in her heart.

"You know, Letty-san. I'm glad you're my master. I feel so incredibly
happy right now."

"Um... why so sudden? I'm happy to hear you say that, but..."

Ellie chuckled at Letty's complex expression, which was a mix of
confusion and delight.

She had just shown her non-human, weapon self, yet nothing had changed.
And Letty was not the kind of person who wouldn't understand the meaning
of that.

"Fufu, hearing you welcome me back just made me want to say it."

"Oh, come on..."

She chuckled in response to Letty's exasperation.

Swallowing the words: *Because it feels like I’m being told this is my
place to return to, no matter who I am.*

\*\*\*

"So, was the replacement finished successfully?"

Letty, who had been accepting Ellie's affectionate gestures, finally
spoke once she seemed content.

"Yes, safely. In fact, I feel better than before."

Ellie answered with a smile, striking a pose as if flexing a bicep with
one arm. The other arm, incidentally, remained wrapped around Letty as
if clinging to her. Letty was momentarily taken aback by the pose but
quickly nodded in relief.

"That's good... that the part wasn't defective."

"Well, I did check it properly, you know. It might even be better than
the previous one. My head feels incredibly clear. Also, the system
version update is a major bonus."

"System version update? I do remember it saying something about that."

Letty tilted her head. She vaguely understood what Ellie meant. *Well,
if Ellie says it’s a good thing, then it probably is.*

"The operability of the Blaster and Bolt has improved, and also...
also?" Ellie suddenly noticed something and fell silent for a moment.

\[Output Correction +400%\]

The information field displaying her status clearly showed her current
condition. She blinked at the difference from the previous information.
The only difference from before, she realized, was...

She gently pulled her arm away from Letty, creating a small distance.

\[Output Correction +300%\]

The number instantly changed.

"...Ellie?"

"Um, Letty-san. Can we explore the Research Facility a little more?"

The image she thought was a dream, seen during the procedure, suddenly
flashed back into her mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Who am I?* The answer has probably never been found.

Life is a series of blind turns.

Wandering, hesitating, sometimes going backward.

Clinging to the slightest signpost.

Up Next: Light in the Labyrinth

Even if it's faint, if there's something certain about it.
