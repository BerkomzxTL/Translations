## Chapter 109: Has Life Been Good?

"From that last bout, I can tell—no, I'm sure of it. Egret, you're
severely lacking in design skills."

The spar was over, and as Dominique put away her wooden sword, she said
this out of the blue. The unexpected words caused Letty to blink in
surprise.

"Eh, Design...? Why is that a problem..."

"You mean planning skills? How does that relate to swordsmanship...?"

Letty and Ellie, who was in the middle of handing Letty a towel, tilted
their heads in confusion. Not only them, but the surrounding onlookers
were also bewildered, unable to understand what she meant. Only
Dominique was laughing cheerfully.

"Well, you could say it's about planning out your moves. Egret, you're
certainly fast, and you have the sharpness to take down most opponents
with a single blow. But you're monotonous, and you don't think about
what comes after. You don't have a plan for what to do if your first
strike is blocked, do you?"

"Ugh... I can't deny that..."

It was true, and she had no retort. Up until now, she had only ever
thought about finishing a fight in a single strike, and it had worked
out most of the time. There were only two exceptions. And she knew very
well that those two incidents could have been fatal had she made even a
single mistake.

"Well, you've managed until now, but when you meet someone like me,
that's a fatal flaw."

"I understand that now. But what should I do?"

"That's where I come in. I'll teach you how to overcome it, carefully
and thoroughly,” She spoke fearlessly.

“*However*,” Dominique then turned to the surrounding guards, who were
listening with great interest. She went around holding out her hand with
a mischievous grin, “I won't be giving any of *you guys* this knowledge
for free. If you want to listen in, you'll have to pay a tuition fee—one
large gold coin per session!"

Hearing the pricey fee, the guards retreated with forced smiles.

Letty, who was watching this, tilted her head and asked, "Wait, do I not
have to pay anything?"

"My my, of course not. I'm just a pushy teacher forcing myself on you,
so the tuition fee is offset by that." Dominique let out a hearty laugh.

"I... see...? I'm not sure if I'm convinced..." Letty responded with a
mixed expression.

There didn't seem to be any hidden motives, and she wasn't giving off
the impression that she was lying. Though it would have been clearer if
she had used her lie detection spell. In any case, that only made it
more puzzling.

"But I don't see what's in it for you..."

"That's right. I don't understand it either."

"Haha, maybe it’s hard to wrap your head around for you youngsters. When
you get to my age, you think about all sorts of things. Let's get out of
here though; this is a bit of a complicated story."

She laughed again and guided the two of them to a nearby patch of shade.
She sat down leaning against a tree, and the two of them sat across from
her. Once they were settled, Dominique began to speak.

"So, what's in it for me, you ask? As I said before, I want to pass on
my swordsmanship. Even if I can't pass on all of it."

"I've heard that before, and I can understand that much..."

Yes, they could understand it. But they couldn't exactly sympathize.
Their expressions must have shown this, as Dominique smiled wryly.

"This is where it gets a little more complicated. First, as you can see,
I'm not married. This kind of job… that’s just how it is. So of course,
I don't have any children. I don't regret it, and I don't have any
lingering feelings about it. But this one thing weighs on my mind."

As she explained, she lightly patted the longsword in her sheath. Her
blade, a reliable comrade for many years, was old but well-maintained,
and it was clear that it was cherished. Above all, the expression on
Dominique's face as she gazed upon her sword was incredibly gentle and
oddly memorable.

"I'm proud to say I've honed my swordsmanship quite a bit. And I've done
a lot of jobs with this sword. At the very least, I've lived a pretty
decent life for someone making a living with just a sword. Not entirely
pure, though."

"Now that you mention it, you said you were staying at a familiar inn
last night. Was that related to your work, too?"

"You remember well. Yes. I helped them out a while ago. They're still
grateful for it. They're very loyal people."

She laughed lightly and nodded. Her tone was light. But the expression
on her face was one of indescribable calmness and warmth. Letty was
curious; she wanted to ask but felt it would be rude, so she didn't pry.

"So, the proof of my life is scattered all over the places I've walked.
Some of them have faded so much that even I can't remember them, but
they’re definitely there."

"Proof of your life..."

Letty didn't fully understand Dominique's words. But suddenly, she
remembered what she had seen in the town of Azar. Thomas, weeping
uncontrollably. His wife and their baby. She didn’t completely
understand why, but it was those moments she recalled.

"But there's one thing that will definitely and completely disappear
when I'm gone. And that's this swordsmanship that I've so carefully
cultivated. I picked it up on my own after dabbling in dojo-style
swordsmanship, but when I think about it, it's a terrible waste. So, as
you heard, I'm just traveling to find someone to pass it on to."

"...You glossed over that last part a bit too much on purpose, didn't
you? The idea of being taught by you has become a lot more serious
now..."

Letty furrowed her brows, and Dominique broke out into a bright and
cheery laughter. Her smile was completely guileless.

"Haha, if you can see right through me, I still have a long way to go.
But still, my eyes were right. You have the value to inherit it. I'm
sure of it."

Letty was startled by the direct gaze and weighty words that came
despite the frivolous atmosphere. She tilted her head, still looking
confused.

"I don't know if I have that kind of value..."

"What are you saying? You do, you definitely do!"

"...Ellie, I think you're a bit too biased..."

Dominique narrowed her eyes in amusement, watching the two youngsters
start what was more a cute argument than a real fight.

*What a truly wonderful encounter.* She thought something so foolish.

"My my, youth is a wonderful thing."

And with that, she teased them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even with no intention of picking a fight, one must fend off any sparks
that come.

And when the hammer swings, it sometimes sweeps everything away
unintentionally.

Up Next: Surprise Attack

It might be like a nightmare.
