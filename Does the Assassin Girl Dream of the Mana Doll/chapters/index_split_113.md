## Chapter 136: And Then, the Two

*Clack, clack,* a hard sound echoed.

The hallway, far removed from the still-ongoing banquet, should have
been chilly, filled with the winter air. Yet, the two there felt no such
cold; instead, there was a pervasive warmth.

Shortly after that minor incident, an exhausted Ellie was carried off by
a bewildered Letty after Batbayar urged them to stay the night. Though
Letty initially declined, Tseren insisted that it would be better and
pushed them to accept. Taking them up on the offer, the two were now
heading to their room.

The chambermaid guiding them, whether instructed or simply discerning,
said nothing unnecessary. She faithfully carried out her duty,
occasionally checking on the two women who walked closely together, with
Letty supporting Ellie, as she led them to the guest room.

"Ellie, are you alright?"

"Ah, yes... I'm alllright, you seee?"

Her voice was more floaty and dreamy than usual. Her steps were slightly
unsteady, and her eyes held a fragile, faraway look. She was utterly
*not* alright. However, knowing that she was the cause of Ellie's
current state, Letty couldn't say anything.

So, she continued to support her as they walked. *Even though Ellie is
stronger,* she thought... *No, I'm just deceiving myself.* A good excuse
had fallen onto her lap—to support Ellie—to walk so closely with her,
and she was taking full advantage of it.

She believed she wasn't drunk. However. In the foreign royal castle of
Cordor, in this hallway, dimly lit by evenly spaced magical lamps, the
place felt even more unfamiliar than it had in the daytime.

Walking side-by-side like this gave Letty the feeling of heading off to
some unknown world.

And,

*If it's just the two of us, maybe that's okay.*

She entertained a thought uncharacteristic of herself.

She believed she wasn’t drunk. However. A different version of herself
was emerging, and she was simply letting herself be swept along. Perhaps
Ellie's heat had transferred to her; the core of her head felt warm. It
was a remarkably pleasant sensation.

"Egret-sama, Ellie-sama. This will be your room." The maid bowed
respectfully just before opening the door.

"...Yes, thank you." Letty thanked her and led Ellie in. She felt a
slight pang of regret at leaving the somewhat fantastical air of the
hallway, but she quickly realized that this was not yet the end.

First, she noticed a faint, sweet floral fragrance. The room was bathed
in a soft sepia colored glow by low-intensity magical lighting and
strategically placed candles. It should have been a calming atmosphere,
but she was acutely aware that she and Ellie would be sleeping in this
room together. Just the two of them.

"Letty-san? Is something wrong...?" Ellie called out, seemingly puzzled
by Letty stopping in her tracks.

“Ah, sorry Ellie, it’s nothing,” Letty replied a little hastily and
stepped further into the room.

"Well then, please make yourselves comfortable. Ah, a bath has been
prepared in that room over there, if you would like." The maid indicated
elegantly in one direction deeper into the room.

“Ah, u-um, thank you for everything." Letty gave a small nod in return,
still supporting Ellie. Then, she led her to the bed.

"Not at all. Good night to you both, and may you have a good evening."
After that, the maid bowed once more and closed the door.

Despite being the royal castle, allowing them to use hot water in the
winter was still a great kindness. To her, Cordor didn’t have the image
of being a place overly rich in water or fuel.

Rather, being a nation of nomadic peoples, it was famous for its wool
production.

Befitting its reputation, Letty laid Ellie down on a high-quality,
royal-commissioned blanket prepared on the bed. She let out a small
sigh. Unconsciously, she gently stroked Ellie's soft hair.

"Hey, Ellie, they prepared a bath for us." She spoke casually. Yet,
Ellie stiffened for a moment, and shortly after, her face turned bright
red.

*Oh?* Letty wondered. Ellie opened her mouth timidly, "U-um,
Letty-san... is the bath, um, for the two of us...?"

"Eh... well, that is..." Now that she mentioned it, that made sense.
Yes. Telling Ellie to bathe alone in her current state would be too
dangerous. The only option left, then, was…

As Letty hesitated, Ellie looked at her. As if wanting to say something.

But Letty knew. Both what they desired and that they couldn't hold back
any longer.

"...Yes, for the two of us. I will wash your body for you."

She was aware that her face was beet red. But even so, she wanted to
convey her feelings and give her consent.

*I want Ellie.*

That desire must have been communicated. Ellie, her cheeks similarly
flushed, nodded. "Then, can I ask one thing of you?"

Letty tilted her head at the question. "Eh, yes, what is it?"

Ellie looked shy. Her eyes wandered for a while, before she slowly
opened her mouth and stammered, "Um, you see... could you, Letty-san,
undress me...?"

She reached out both hands. The words, the gesture, the shy expression.
Letty felt a shock as if she had been punched, followed by an equally
dizzying rush. She didn't know why. No, she did. Her breathing grew
ragged, and her heart began to pound fiercely.

She swallowed hard.

"Y-yes... if that's what you want, Ellie..."

*How unfair*, she thought. She knew there was a part of her that *did*
want to undress Ellie. But seeing Ellie's delighted smile made all that
irrelevant.

"Yes, Letty-san, please."

As requested, Letty leaned over Ellie. She understood the structure of
the clothes. ...Though she would never admit that she had secretly
watched Ellie change. She put her hand on the sash of her robe and
smoothly untied it. Though she tried to pull up the loosely spread robe,
Ellie's waist prevented it from coming off cleanly. She wrapped her arm
around Ellie's waist, lifted her up, slipped the hem past her feet, and
pulled the robe off completely.

Pulled close, in intimate proximity. Their eyes met; a shy smile
bloomed.

"Ellie."

"Yes."

After that brief exchange, they leaned in. For a kiss. Just a light
touch, but the core of her head felt electrified.

Once more, twice, three times. While their lips met repeatedly, Letty
reached behind and unbuttoned the dress. She smoothly pulled it down,
then lifted her waist again to slip it off her feet.

A sweet fragrance wafted up. It was the familiar scent of Ellie. But
more concentrated than what she was used to.

*Not yet, not yet.* She suppressed the feeling that something might
snap. She couldn't lose herself now. She wanted to commit each and every
detail to memory.

A deep breath.

Though it was to steady herself, Ellie's scent continued to be etched
deeper and deeper into her body. The heat intensified. She did feel a
little calmer. But at the same time, a little greedier.

Perhaps that's why.

Her fingers started to become increasingly decisive. She reached for the
chemise and the undergarments. Piece by piece. As if drawn in by the
slowly, increasingly exposed white skin.

And then, Ellie's body, in its natural state, was revealed, eliciting a
feverish sigh from Letty. Amidst the subdued light was her pristine
white skin, framed by her golden hair, and her blue eyes, hot and
languid.

She stared intently.

"Ellie... you're beautiful..." She whispered with a sigh.

"Oh, please don't stare so much..." Though she spoke shyly, Ellie made
no move to cover herself. If Letty wished, she would allow it. Her
unspoken intent was conveyed, and Letty's heart pounded almost
painfully.

"Then, I'll hold you." As soon as she spoke, she was already holding
her. A body softer than usual, a scent sweeter than usual. Everything
about her chipped away at Letty's self-control.

"Mmh... Hey, Letty-san... You take off your clothes too...? I want to
feel more of you..." As she spoke, she unbuttoned Letty's shirt. That
simple action accelerated Letty's heart even further.

Deliberately, she let the shirt fall. ...In the meantime, Ellie's hands
had unbuckled her waist belt and unbuttoned her trousers.

"...Hey, Ellie... aren't you a little too skilled at this?"

"You're one to talk, Letty-san."

They looked at each other and chuckled softly. Well, it seemed they both
had some secrets. Feeling a little lighter, Letty let her clothes drop
as encouraged. When she exposed everything to Ellie's eyes, she felt a
sense of fulfillment.

"Letty-san... beautiful."

"Hearing that from you, Ellie... You’re more beautiful."

She glanced down at her own body. Perhaps because her diet had improved
since meeting Ellie, she had filled out in various ways. But it was
still far from Ellie's captivating figure. However, Ellie shook her
head.

"That's not true, Letty-san, you're incredibly beautiful... To me,
you're the most beautiful in the world."

"Well... To me, you’re the most beautiful in the world."

They traded compliments, giggled, and smiled. Followed by a light,
playful kiss.

"Then, will you make me even more beautiful?"

Ellie held out her arms again.

"Yes, I will make you much, much more beautiful."

As Letty stepped into the space between her arms, Ellie wrapped hers
around her neck. They gazed at each other from close range, smiling...
and their lips met again. Repeating the light, teasing kisses, Letty
lifted Ellie into her arms.

Then, she carried her to the bathhouse.

And made her the most beautiful and happiest person in the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a small part of the human experience, repeated as a matter of
course.

It was just one of many experiences.

Yet, why does the world seem so much brighter?

Up Next: A New Beginning

And so, their days together begin anew.

Regarding what happened in the bathhouse and that night, I will probably
upload it somewhere at a later date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TN: I couldn’t find this supposed bathhouse upload. That chapter 104.5
is all we get...
