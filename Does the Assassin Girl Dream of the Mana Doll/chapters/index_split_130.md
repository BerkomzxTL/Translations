## Chapter 153: The Day Before the Tournament

From that point on, every day was a repeat of intense practice. It was
sparring as if in a real fight, focused on how to land a single decisive
blow. The exchanges, including psychological maneuvering, continued
relentlessly.

"Your eyes give it away completely! No one would fall for a feint like
that!"

"Ugh, th-this is it!"

She tried to deceive and disrupt her with her movements. She tried to
use changes in speed to unsettle her. She employed every imaginable
tactic, only to be parried, yet she challenged her again and again.

Every day, she practiced until she was completely exhausted, but by the
next morning, she was perfectly recovered.

*"This practice uses your head more than your body. As long as you eat
properly, your mind recovers faster than your body,"* Dominique had
claimed, and at least that didn't seem to be a lie. While maintaining
her body’s condition, she focused on honing her techniques.

\*\*\*

"Alright, let's call it a day. Get a full day of rest tomorrow and
prepare for the tournament."

"Y-Yes, I understand..."

Letty collapsed on the ground, breathless, while Dominique looked
refreshed. No, there was sweat on Dominique's brow, too, but the
difference in their fatigue was obvious.

"Letty-san, you worked hard today."

Ellie hurried over and handed her a towel. Letty took it and slowly
wiped the sweat from her face. She let out a long sigh of relief.

"Well, you've kept up quite a bit, really."

"It's hard to accept when you say that with such composure..."

In the end, she couldn't land a single decisive blow. There were times
when she came very close, but she never quite reached it. She gazed at
Dominique with a look of utter frustration.

"But, but, Letty-san has definitely grown! Watching from the side, I
completely lost track of what either of you were doing!" Ellie
emphatically made fists with both her hands

"Um, is that a compliment, Ellie...?" Letty frowned with a troubled
expression. She casually glanced down at her own hands. She did think
she had grown, though.

"I'll give you that you've grown. There's nothing more certain than
that, is there?" Dominique spoke casually.

Letty shot her a look of exasperation. "You would say that yourself... I
won't deny it, though."

A brief pause followed, as if she were thinking. Then, she opened her
mouth again, "How much have I grown?"

"That's a difficult question. 'Quite a lot' is vague, but... let's see,
enough to hang onto my ankle, maybe?"

"I see. So, not completely beyond my reach, then."

"That's right."

She didn't know whether to be happy or frustrated with that answer.
Dominique grinned at Letty as she wore a complicated expression.

"Well, it means you've improved enough for me to get a little serious."

"It's frustrating that I couldn't make you completely serious..."

She let out a breath. That distant back felt both closer and yet still
far away.

Still, Letty felt a faint sense of confidence. She stared intently at
her open palms. There were no calluses or blisters on them.

\*\*\*

After Letty's breathing settled, they disbanded for the day and returned
to their respective inns. Her tired body, especially her exhausted mind,
craved food, and she ate a heartier amount than usual. As soon as she
got back to the room and lay on the bed, she was immediately overtaken
by sleepiness.

"No, Letty-san, you have to wipe yourself off properly!"

Her overly attentive partner woke her up, and she grudgingly wiped her
body clean. She felt glances lingering on her during the process, but
that was normal now. After changing into her sleepwear and finally lying
down in bed, Ellie immediately snuggled into her arms.

"...Ellie, I know you know this, but it's nothing today and tomorrow,
alright...?"

"...Of course, I know that."

She hugged Ellie, who was clearly avoiding eye contact, and chuckled
softly. She held her tightly in her arms and closed her eyes. She felt a
surprising sense of calm.

\*\*\*

The next day, she woke up early as usual, had breakfast, and spent the
morning leisurely. In the early afternoon, they decided they couldn't
stay in the room all day, so they agreed to go for a walk.

Walking through the city of Cordor in the cold winter air was somehow
enjoyable for the two of them. They visited the general store they had
been to before to look for treasures and window-shopped at the stalls
that were already set up.

"It feels like there are more people now."

"The swordsmanship tournament starts tomorrow, so the city must be full
of merchants and swordsmen, of course, but also travelers and
adventurers who have come to watch."

It felt funny that the one who was actually participating in the
tournament was so relaxed, taking a stroll like this. The tournament was
tomorrow. She knew that. She was participating. She knew that too. Even
though she clearly recognized this, her heart was strangely calm.

"Hey, Ellie. Do you think I can win?"

"Of course! Unless Dominique-san decides to jump in."

"Ah... she might do that."

They looked at each other and chuckled softly. Strangely, she felt no
anxiety. The few days of practice since returning from the ruins had
been truly fulfilling. She felt that they were days where she could
absorb and grow, day after day. She also had the sense that all of that
was truly taking shape within her body.

"Tomorrow... It's finally here, isn't it?" She murmured softly while
looking up.

The winter sky above was busy changing color; shifting to a reddish
evening glow.

Cutting it down, kicking it away. It intertwines nevertheless.

Slowly, gradually, wrapping around the feet, around the neck.

Karma; an invisible thread woven from the sins of man.

The more she shakes it off, the more accumulates.

Up Next: Entangled Karma

It always arrives unexpectedly.
