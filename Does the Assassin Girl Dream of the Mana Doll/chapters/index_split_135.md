## Chapter 158: The Remnants of Fervor

Letty was perplexed by the unfamiliar cheers and, most of all, the
overwhelming barrage of emotions that had never been directed at her
before. *Why are these people so excited?* She had entered here for her
own reasons and passed the preliminary round. It was just that, nothing
more.

Yet, the audience in this arena seemed to rejoice as if it were their
own victory. Apparently, all those cheers were for her. She found it
utterly baffling.

And most of all, she was puzzled that her own emotions were being
stirred by this.

Her heart was pounding. She could feel her cheeks flush, a sign that her
body temperature was rising.

She was simply being cheered on by strangers. Although these were easily
thousands of people. Why was she so affected by people she had no
relation to?

While she was still bewildered, one of the referees approached her.
"Since you've earned it, you should acknowledge the cheers," He
suggested.

"Acknowledge the cheers, you say, but how...?" She replied with a
troubled look.

Seeing this, the referee chuckled softly and kindly told her what to do.
"It's simple. Just raise a hand and wave it around in different
directions. That's enough to satisfy them."

"I-Is that so...?" She was skeptical, but she didn't know what else to
do. She stared at her own hands for a while, but then, making up her
mind, she raised one hand. She then waved it toward a random section of
the audience.

Immediately, the cheers, which had been starting to subside, swelled up
again with a roar. She nearly flinched and pulled her hand back in
reaction. Controlling herself, Letty tentatively waved in all four
directions. The cheers from the directions she faced grew even louder,
and compelled by the noise, before she knew it she found herself waving
two more times.

At that point, her embarrassment reached its limit and she hastily
withdrew. Even her retreat was met with mostly favorable reactions.

*What is this?*

*This reaction….*

*What is this feeling?*

Despite her confusion, it was certainly not unpleasant.

\*\*\*

"Oh my... Egret-sama has such a cute side to her, doesn't she?"

"Fufufu I know, right! Letty-san is absolutely wonderful!"

In the royal viewing box, Ellie was still proudly doting on her. Tseren,
who had been nodding along, suddenly looked as if something occurred to
her.

"But with this, she might become too popular from too many directions."

"...Eh. T-That is, well, yes... right?"

Even without considering her being a beautiful swordswoman with
overwhelming skill, the added element of 'gap moe' was now in play.
There was no way she wouldn't become popular. Given Letty's personality,
she wouldn't cheat, but who knew what might happen if crowds of people
flocked to her.

While Ellie was absorbed in this spontaneously pessimistic fantasy,
Letty returned.

"I'm back... What's wrong, Ellie?"

"Let-Letty-san!"

Ellie, who would normally be waiting near the entrance upon hearing her
footsteps, was sitting in her seat, looking stunned. As Letty looked on,
puzzled, Ellie reacted to her voice and immediately rushed over,
clinging to her.

"Letty-san, please don't ever abandon me!?"

"Wait, what happened, what are you talking about? There's no way I would
ever abandon you..."

"I'm sorry, Egret-sama, actually..."

Tseren apologetically explained the situation. Letty listened, and then
gave a small nod of understanding.

"I understand, and well, I was confused by all that, too... but I only
have Ellie, so it's fine."

"Letty-san... *Sob*, thank you!"

As Ellie clung to her tightly, she hugged her back with a squeeze.
Tseren watched the scene with a look of relief, nodding repeatedly.

Beside them, Dominique and Batbayar watched with expressions that were
hard to read.

"Say, sister, isn't this a bit too sweet for a drinking snack?"

"Well, I guess it can't be helped when young women gather."

Dominique chuckled, tilted her glass, and drank it down. She poured
herself another drink.

"Alright, Egret, come over here for a minute. That wasn't bad, but I'll
tell you what you need to fix."

"Ah, yes, I understand. Please do."

Letty nodded, released Ellie, and headed over to Dominique.

\*\*\*

Having broken through the preliminaries, Letty continued to win her
matches smoothly. With every match she won, Dominique offered pointers,
and she continued to improve her skill. Without taking a single hit, she
advanced all the way to the finals.

Her opponent was, as expected, the armored man. He wielded the same fury
he displayed in the preliminaries throughout the tournament, scattering
his opponents in a matter of seconds. In the semi-finals alone, his
opponent managed to parry the first strike. But that was the limit of
their skill. The armored man's second, rougher strike, which suggested
frustration, easily swept him aside.

"...I see. I understand what Dominique was talking about."

In the silent arena, Letty murmured softly as she observed the match.
She had watched all of his matches up until now. And gradually,
something had become clear to her.

"He’s the same person as he was back then."

She stated this definitively, her voice full of certainty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The body returned from hell is driven by an obsession akin to a grudge.

Having swept aside and scattered all others, the stage is finally set.

Facing his long-desired opponent, his savage fangs are bared.

Up Next: Clash—Human vs. The Inhuman

The honed blade will meet it head-on.
