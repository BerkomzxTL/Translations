## Chapter 141: Her Desired Future

"Now, that was the movement for a horizontal swing, but you can apply it
to a thrust as well."

"I see, like this?"

Letty nodded and immediately demonstrated. She used the same movement:
bracing with her legs, channeling the power generated by her hips
through her spine's axis... and thrusting her arm out as if pushing it
with that rotation.

"Exactly. How does that feel?"

"The power is clearly increased, but... wouldn't this be hard to use? It
feels like it would get stuck, too deep to pull out."

She pulled back her extended arm, scrutinizing it. She had a sense that
the arm, though her own, felt alien, as if she wasn't fully controlling
it.

"You notice the good points quickly; that's sharp. If you wanted to, you
could pierce plate armor, but retrieving the sword would be a nightmare.
So, you either use it in an uncrowded space, or you carry a spare and
let go immediately if it gets stuck."

"So, it's about time and place... I guess I really need to think things
through beforehand."

She looked at her hand again. What she had acquired seemed to be more
than she could handle right now. She couldn't fully control it. If that
were the case, she would train until she mastered it. It was a feeling
she hadn't experienced in a long time, but it was a familiar one.
However, doing it spontaneously was a first. A slight smile appeared on
her face.

"And finally, there's the vertical swing. That one probably won't be too
difficult for you. Though it will take time to get the same level of
power as me."

"You'll teach me that too? Thank you."

Letty looked at Dominique while lightly clenching and unclenching her
right hand. Confirming that the numbness had apparently passed, she
gripped the wooden sword with her right hand again.

"The important thing about a vertical swing is not to swing with just
your arm."

"Not just with my arm. ...Do you mean being conscious of the rest of my
body, just like before?"

"That's right. First, swing the wooden sword hard using only your arm
strength. Just once."

As instructed, she lifted and swung down the sword using only her arm.
It was a movement she didn't usually use much, and she performed it with
a little more force than usual.

"It feels strange, swinging while consciously using only my arm."

"In what way?"

"Well... I feel like my body is being pulled upward."

She tilted her head while answering Dominique's question, and Dominique
nodded as if she had just confirmed her suspicion.

"Yes, that awareness is the first important thing for this technique. If
you swing with only arm strength, the recoil makes your body rise. You
had already mastered a vertical swing that avoided that, but I doubt you
consciously thought about it, right?"

"Ah, no, that's true... I was just doing what I was told."

And that had been enough. Before now, she never had to consider fighting
heavily armored warriors or monsters with tough hides head-on. But
things would surely be different from now on. If so, she should learn
the technique, including this underlying theory.

"In the world of swordsmanship, there's a concept called Shu-Ha-Ri¹.
First, you thoroughly follow and diligently practice what your master
tells you. I think that's what you do best, isn't it?"

"I would agree with that."

Letty nodded in response. Dominique nodded back and continued.

"However, after a while, you'll hit a wall just by doing that. For
instance, my sword is for me; it's not for you. You and I have different
heights, different arm lengths, and different muscle formations. That
means the most suitable body movement for you is not mine.

“When that time comes, you have to discover your own movements. Even if
it means breaking away from my teachings. For that purpose, it's good to
know the theories behind *why* this technique is done this way. Once you
find the movement that suits you, you pursue it, and successfully
graduate from my teachings."

"Graduating from Dominique's teachings... I wonder how many years that
will take."

*How long would it take to completely master every single technique I’m
being taught?* The more she learned, the more she realized the vast gap
between herself and Dominique. However, that didn't dampen her
motivation; quite the opposite.

"I don't know how long it will take either. But I don't think it will
take you too long."

"...You have a lot of confidence in me."

"Of course. What you've accumulated is that substantial."

"...I see."

Of course, it didn't compare to what Dominique had accumulated. Still,
she too certainly possessed something substantial.

"We got sidetracked. Now, let's talk about the actual execution... When
you lift the sword and swing it down, you bend your knees and lower your
hips following the downward momentum. Start by doing it exaggeratedly,
almost to the point where your back knee touches the ground."

"Eh, okay."

Dominique demonstrated before Letty tried it herself.

Swinging up and swinging down. Up to this point, it was the same. The
wooden sword gained downward momentum, and instead of resisting that
momentum, she let her hips drop. Lowering her back knee almost to the
ground was awkward and tiring.

Nevertheless.

"...I, see? It feels like I'm swinging the sword with the weight of my
body?"

"That's ultimately what it comes down to. The initial part is with the
arm, but the power comes from your body weight. Naturally, when you use
it in actual combat, you won't lower your hips this extremely, it will
only be a slight movement. This is purely practice to grasp the feeling.
You'll alternate this movement, stepping forward with your right foot,
then your left foot. In fact, walking around this area while doing that
movement is good practice."

"Understood, I'll try that."

Letty nodded readily and started repeating the movement. She had
definitely felt the sensation of her weight being loaded onto the sword.
To avoid forgetting that feeling, she tirelessly repeated the motion.
Dropping her hips according to gravity, she had to avoid losing balance
and wobbling, which would waste energy.

She had to maintain balance, tolerate no deviation in her body axis, and
yet move smoothly. Her knees and thighs hurt, and her core was
surprisingly strained.

But this training was valuable. And she put her heart into it.

Letty concentrated intensely, walking and swinging down the sword over
and over.

\*\*\*

"Hey, Egret, time for a break. ...You'd keep going forever if I didn't
stop you."

"Oh, yeah.” Letty, who had stopped practicing, nodded at Dominique's
voice and came back. “...I don't dislike repetitive training. And this
training, well... I feel like I'm acquiring the technique."

"Is that so? That's the most important thing."

At the word "break," Letty took out her canteen and drank a few sips of
water. Watching her, Dominique suddenly spoke.

"Hey, Egret, I've always wanted to ask you something. Why did you decide
to polish your swordsmanship? I know I'm your master and I'm pushing
this on you, but still."

"Oh, that's sudden... Is it that strange?"

"A little, yeah. With your skill and movement, wouldn't the *other side*
have been more profitable? In fact, your physique is a bit unsuited for
putting yourself on the line as a public swordsman. And I doubt you’re
unaware of that."

"Ah, I see what you mean."

Letty nodded, agreeing that Dominique's question was reasonable. She
found it a little amusing that she was no longer surprised that her
background was almost completely exposed. She took another sip of water.

After thinking for a moment.

"I'll tell you if you keep it a secret."

"Of course. I may talk a lot, but I'm not careless with my words."

"What a strange thing to say. ...Well, okay. ...The trigger was Ellie
starting to learn painting. I might not have shown you yet, but Ellie is
really good at painting. No, it's more accurate to say she became good."

"Hmm, I can certainly imagine Ellie painting."

Although Ellie's demeanor became a bit suspicious when Letty was
involved, considering her usual elegant atmosphere, it would make sense.
Since she was a mage, it wouldn’t be surprising to assume that she had
come from a good family and naturally possessed an aptitude for the
arts.

Though Ellie wasn't a mage. That was something even Dominique didn't
know.

"We’re traveling now because of circumstances, but after this journey is
over, she might aim to become a painter. She might even become someone
noteworthy. ...I wanted to be able to stand properly beside her at that
time."

She didn't know how successful Ellie's paintings would become. But it
was a possible future. And the way she was now...

"Just for money, the other side would probably be more profitable. But I
didn't want *that* me to be by Ellie's side. I wanted to be able to step
out into the open, earn a legitimate living, and stand proudly next to
her. That's the person I want to become. So, when you spoke to me,
Dominique, the timing was almost too good. It surprised me."

After saying all that, she abruptly stopped talking. She covered her
mouth with her hand and looked down slightly.

"...I feel like I'm saying something silly."

"No, it's not silly at all. Though I do feel like I'm being subjected to
a bit of bragging."

"That wasn't my intention..."

"Ah, I know that too."

She knew, but still. Their youth was somehow irritating, and Dominique
found herself scratching her head for no reason.

"Egret, have you told Ellie that?"

"No, I haven't. ...It feels embarrassing somehow, and I feel like it
would be a burden on her..."

"If it were her, she'd probably cry with joy. Well, tell her if you feel
like it."

"Yeah, well... I'll think about it."

"You're not honest about things like that... Well, fine. Let's start
training again now."

Dominique, looking slightly refreshed, and Letty both stood up.
