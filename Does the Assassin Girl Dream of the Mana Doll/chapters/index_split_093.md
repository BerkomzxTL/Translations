## Chapter 116: It All Depends on How You Use It

The two rejoined the caravan as the signal to depart was given. They
mounted their horses as before, splitting up to the left and right. Just
as they separated and their figures threatened to disappear behind a
twist in the path, their gazes met. They looked at each other for a
moment, then gave a small smile and a wave before taking their
respective places.

All the things they were thinking. All the things they wanted to say.

*All of that will have to wait until we safely reach tonight's inn.*
Telling herself this, Letty first cast a spell to use her detection
magic to remain vigilant of her surroundings.

\*\*\*

Oddly, their vigilance this time was in vain. As dusk approached, they
arrived at the post town without incident.

The caravan took the carriages and their cargo to the merchant guild's
warehouse, where the horses were moved to the adjoining stables to rest.
A few of the guards would stay overnight to watch over the warehouse,
while the rest would go to the inn the guild had a contract with. By the
way, the overnight guards received extra pay for their work, so there
were no complaints.

"Now that’s a man who knows how to use money," Dominique said, praising
the merchant with a laugh.

Letty listened, thinking, *Is that how it is?* She understood that there
were ways to properly use money, and that it was just as easy to
mismanage. However, this was the first time since she had started this
journey that she had considered using money for something other than
necessary expenses, for herself or someone else.

"How to use money... What's a good way to use it?"

"Huh? Well... in this case, he's using it effectively to achieve his own
goals. He weighs the risks that can be avoided by spending money against
the amount he's spending to find a balance where he doesn't lose, and in
fact, gains something. Oh, and he's also thinking about how to make the
guards who are staying overnight feel good about their work."

"So it's not just about his own profit?"

"That's right. As far as I know, most good merchants value the idea of
'mutual benefit.' Business isn't a one-time thing; it has to be
continuous. Making connections and not enemies is sometimes more
important than making a profit."

"I see... I think I understand."

Of course, she had never been in business, but Letty had seen merchants
many times during her journey. What kind of expressions they had and
what they said when they sold things. She had seen it many times before,
yet it felt as if she was truly understanding for the first time.

"On the other hand, I knew a man who made a lot of enemies for the sake
of a quick profit, and he was hated terribly."

"Haha, he probably didn't die a good death. Karma comes around."

"...Mhm, I guess so."

As someone who was on the side of not allowing people decent deaths,
Letty could only give a vague answer. Dominique's eyes narrowed for a
moment, but she didn't say anything about it.

"Well, how you use money is important even if you're not a merchant. You
have your own thoughts on that, don't you?"

"Yes, I do."

"Then, if you try to apply what others might think, you'll find a better
way to use it."

"What would other people think, huh..."

When Letty heard that, she recalled a back she knew well. A back that
always looked a little bigger despite her desperately following from
behind. And, the painting after she added her brushstrokes.

"Yes, that's right... I know that's important. ...Can I do that too?"

"I won't say for everything, but at the very least, you can figure out
what Ellie is thinking, can't you? Besides, if you can't understand her,
no one can."

"No, no, that's not what I meant..."

She waved her hands in denial, flustered by Dominique's grin. Still, she
couldn't stop her face from turning red and revealing her emotions.
Letty looked at her with a sullen, resentful expression.

"Don't make that face. If you do something you think is right for that
girl, you won't make a big mistake. And even if you do make a mistake,
if you apologize honestly, she'll forgive you."

"That's true, but... I don't want to take advantage of that."

Dominique couldn't help but smile after hearing such a pure and adorable
response. Though she made sure Letty couldn’t see her softening
expression. Perhaps she would notice with her annoyingly precise
intuition, but Dominique irresponsibly thought that in that case she
would just push the blame onto her too-perceptive student.

For better or for worse, Letty didn't notice and just kept giving her a
sulky look. Seeing that, Dominique put on a cocky expression.

"Then don't rely on it."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

She flashed Letty a rare, gentle smile.

"First, you put your heart into it. If it fails, you take responsibility
and clean up the mess. You need to be prepared to do that. Of course,
depending on the extent of the failure, earning back trust is a big
deal. The question is whether you have the resolve to do it, even if you
have to overcome it."

"Ahh, I see..." Letty nodded in understanding.

“Hmm,” Dominique hummed as she stared at Letty for a moment. Then, with
a gentle smile, she asked, "Is it that important?"

"Yes, it is. Very important." The answer came back instantly, without
hesitation.

Dominique was a little taken aback. But she quickly put on a confident
grin, "Then it's just as important to her. Don't worry, she won't just
brush you off for a little mistake."

"Ah, yes, that's true... I see, this is also about thinking about how
the other person thinks..."

"That's right. What do you think? Was that helpful?" Dominique wore a
triumphant grin.

Letty nodded innocently, without any hidden intentions, "Yes, it was
very helpful. Thank you, now I understand what I want to do."

Her overly pure response flustered Dominique. "O-oh, that's good. Then,
go for it without any regrets!"

"No, I don't need to be that passionate... But yes, I'll try."

Letty then gave a slight bow before walking over to Ellie.

"Ellie, sorry, can you go on ahead?"

"Eh, ah, okay? You know where the place is, right?"

"Yes, I do. And if anything happens, I can find you."

"Right, you have that, Letty-san, so I'm not worried. ...You'll know
where I am right away, anyway."

Mischievous and confident. Seeing her with such a gentle smile, Letty
found herself simply nodding along and speaking honestly.

"...Yes. No matter where you are, I'll definitely find you."

"...Letty-san, can you come here for a second?" After being hit with
such a direct reply, Ellie grabbed Letty's arm and dragged her toward a
corner of the warehouse.

“Hm?” Letty tilted her head and let herself be pulled without
resistance.

Once they were hidden in the shadows, Ellie leaned in close and spoke in
rapid fire, "That's what I'm talking about, saying things like that in
front of other people, you flirt! What kind of face was I supposed to
make? Seriously!"

"Huh... but I think you were saying pretty much the same thing..."

*How unreasonable*, Letty grumbled in her heart.

Still, seeing Ellie's face right in front of her, angry while blushing,
yet unable to hide her overflowing happiness…

Yes, it was both fulfilling and amusing.

*This side of her isn’t so bad either*.

Thoughts are invisible things, and they are not light.

Therefore, people try their best to give them form.

Sometimes they go to great lengths, sparing no expense.

And yet, it slips through their fingers.

Sometimes words are worth more than gold.
