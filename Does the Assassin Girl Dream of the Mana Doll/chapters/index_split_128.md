## Chapter 151: When Temptation Takes Control

The exploration continued after that, but nothing more was found.

"Maybe there's something in the other facilities..."

"That will have to wait for another time. We don't have enough supplies
to continue any further right now."

Letty stood firm despite Ellie’s reluctance to leave. They still had
plenty of portable rations, but at most, enough for two more days. That
was more than enough to return the way they came, but clearly
insufficient to proceed deeper into the ruins.

"You're right. The tournament is coming up too, so maybe after that’s
over."

"Mm, I'm sorry, but... I can't really not participate."

After all, King Batbayar himself had made the arrangements, so she
couldn't possibly back out. While he might laugh it off, there was a
difference between what was acceptable and what wasn't.

And more importantly.

"Besides, you're going to show me how cool you are, right?"

"Yes, of course."

Letty shot a confident smile back at Ellie as she peered into her face.
Though she cautioned herself internally, knowing that winning wouldn't
be so easy.

"For that, we need to get back safely first."

"That's right."

With that, Letty drew her shortsword and Ellie gathered mana in both
hands. A golem that poked its head around the corner was instantly shot
through, and the monster that leaped out from behind it was sliced open
by Letty.

\*\*\*

The subsequent skirmishes involved no particularly problematic monsters.
By evening, they were able to return to the capital safely.

"Phew... I feel a bit relieved, as expected."

"Yes, definitely... compared to being inside the ruins."

They chatted like this as they walked side by side. The cityscape,
gradually turning red, felt somewhat chilly due to the weak winter sun.
Still, the hustle and bustle of people rushing home or shopping for
dinner was somehow reassuring. The two walked, weaving through the flow.

"I was thinking of heading straight to the inn, but before that, can we
go to Dominique's place?"

"Eh, I don't mind, of course, but why?"

Ellie nodded at the suggestion as they walked, but looked puzzled. She
had assumed they would head straight back.

"I want to report our return and tell her that I want to take tomorrow
off and resume training the day after tomorrow."

"Oh, right. We only told Dominique-san 'a few days,' didn't we?"

"Yeah, I never expected to finish in two days..."

It was quite common for ruin exploration to take several days, or even
over a week. So they had prepared food with plenty of margin of error,
but it turned out to be surprisingly quick. Credit for all of this
belonged to Ellie, of course.

"Dominique-san might have her own plans. ...But speaking of which, what
does Dominique-san do when she's alone?"

"Now that you mention it, it's a mystery... I just have this image of
her wandering around by herself."

They had always acted together since they met, but that was because they
were doing things like guarding or practicing swordsmanship. Since they
were colleagues and student/master, that was to be expected.

"For someone so open, Dominique is quite a mystery."

"Now that you say that, her behavior does seem like some sort of
camouflage..."

They exchanged glances and wry smiles. Perhaps if they asked, she would
answer. No, they both had a feeling she would just evade the question.

"If we ask, she'll probably say, 'Don't be so crude as to pry.'"

"Ahaha, you sounded quite like her just now!"

"That makes me feel conflicted for some reason..."

Of course, Letty didn't dislike Dominique at all. *But why does becoming
similar to her feel so... strange?* Thinking such disrespectful things,
or rather, voicing them, they headed toward the inn where Dominique was
staying.

\*\*\*

"Oh, you're back already? That was fast."

"Yes, it was closer than we thought."

"Thanks to that, we were able to return safely."

Letty glanced around the area as they greeted Dominique, who was
drinking in the pub attached to the inn.

"By the way, Dominique... how long have you been drinking?"

"Hmm? I haven't had much at all."

Dominique's casual reply made it clear she wasn't particularly drunk.
Letty looked around again but with cold eyes.

"Then what about all these people passed out around here who look like
they were drinking with you?"

"Oh, these guys? They gathered around me while I was drinking, and one
by one they collapsed as we got rowdy. Honestly, for how young they are
they’re quite sloppy."

"No, these people seem like they’d be quite strong drinkers..."

Letty retorted to Dominique's exasperated tone with her own. Next to
them, Ellie could only offer a troubled smile.

"Well, that aside. What's the plan? Should we resume training right away
tomorrow?"

"About that, I want to take tomorrow off, just in case. Is that
alright?"

"Ah, that's fine. It'd be foolish to get injured during practice because
you still have fatigue after a safe return."

"Thank you, that's true."

Indeed, it would defeat the purpose of their safe return. Although, she
could perhaps ask Tseren to dispatch someone who could use healing
magic. Letty nodded in agreement.

"Then, the day after tomorrow, at the usual time and place."

"Yes, let's do that."

After confirming, Dominique gave them a mean-spirited, knowing grin.

"It’s a rare day off. Make sure you don't leave yourself completely worn
out on the day after tomorrow, alright?"

"...I'll be careful about that."

Next to the tight-lipped Letty, Ellie blushed and looked down.

\*\*\*

They brushed off Dominique as she started drinking alone again and left
the inn. They walked in silence for a while.

"Well, now we have a day off without any issues."

"Y-Yes, that's right."

Ellie was still slightly red-faced, probably due to Dominique's teasing.
Letty, for some reason, was even quieter than usual. Just when they were
finally heading back to the inn, that remark inevitably made them both
self-conscious. Especially in the strange scenery where the sun was
setting, the dim light was falling, and the streetlights had begun to
illuminate the city.

*Ah, but tomorrow is a day off. So, why not?* She gently took Ellie's
hand next to her, causing Ellie to flinch.

"Hey, Ellie."

"Y-Yes, what is it, Letty-san?"

As soon as Ellie replied, Letty brought her lips close to Ellie's ear.

"When we get back to the inn, let's take it slow, okay?"

She deliberately separated the words. Ellie's face instantly turned
bright red, having understood the implication.

"Y-Yes."

Ellie nodded and squeezed Letty's hand tightly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just when she feels close, she grows distant again.

A distance she’s reminded of with every step she takes.

But by embracing it and moving forward, she continues to strengthen her
heart for that eventual day.

Up Next: A Still Distant Back

To eventually reach that back.
