## Fanart 2

Now that Arc 2 is finished, I'd like to share some fan art that I
received!

Just like last time, it's from Momijizaki Momiji-san!!

First image: A full body illustration of Letty and a collection of
expressions.

What do you think? Isn't it quite Letty-like, with her meager
expressions and style focused solely on practicality?

The expressions are all ones I could easily imagine her making from time
to time.

Second page: Full body illustration and expression sheet of Ellie.

How about this body!!

I've ended up sounding like the president of some mail-order program...

But I think this really captures the essence of Ellie, don't you?

Also, it has a more doll-like expression, to the point where even I, the
creator, thought, "Oh, so she makes this kind of face," which is kind of
backwards.

I received something truly wonderful, thank you very much!
