## Chapter 127: By Way of Greeting

And so, the next morning.

After everyone regrouped, the magistrate shook the hand of each guard
and merchant, expressing his gratitude. Taken aback by the unexpected
welcome, the men looked embarrassed but clearly weren't displeased.

Once that was over, they were finally ready to depart for the royal
capital. In addition to the existing members, the magistrate and five
knights planned to accompany them.

"Normally, we should prepare a larger number, but they are currently
deployed for security for the upcoming swordsmanship tournament... My
deepest apologies, Princess Tseren."

"No, not at all. You have duties to maintain the capital's safety. These
arrangements alone are much appreciated."

"Ohh... what gracious words..."

Such scenes unfolded.

In reality, the magistrate couldn’t stray too far from the post town, as
it was close to the capital and subjected to heavy traffic; incidents
occurring here could easily spread to the city.

The five knights left behind were the town's best: individuals whose
personal valor was worthy of protecting the magistrate, or who possessed
the ability to take command in the event of an emergency. The fact that
the magistrate was deploying all five of his elite men and himself
showed how thoroughly he intended to ensure Tseren's safety. Her
gratitude was natural, and the merchants and Dominique were also
grateful.

Though, what Dominique was grateful for was that she no longer had to
worry about their rear. Unfortunately, even these elites did not seem to
meet her standards.

"Alright then, the magistrate will be in the middle carriage, and the
knights will accompany Princess Tseren right next to it. Ah, and let's
have them secure the opposite side as well, just in case. And,
Magistrate-sama, I'll ask you to take command of the middle and rear."

"Hmph, so you mean for us to dedicate ourselves to protecting Princess
Tseren?" The magistrate raised an eyebrow during the discussion on how
to escort Tseren to the Capital.

She accepted his reaction easily. "To put it simply, yes. I and this
tomboy here will be the ones kicking them all to shreds."

"I think that choice of words is a little questionable." Letty, who was
pulled into the conversation, looked slightly displeased. Although she
didn't seem to object to the role itself.

As Dominique expected, the sidelined magistrate and knights looked
dubious. "Well, I imagine you're not convinced, so let's show you what
we can do. Egret, let's have our morning practice."

"Ah, so that's what this is about... Fine." With an exasperated look,
Letty also picked up a wooden sword.

The two faced each other in the slightly spacious garden of the
magistrate's residence, their meeting point.

As always, Letty took her diagonal stance, with her right foot and right
hand forward. Dominique, too, took her usual half-body stance,
presenting her right side.

"Alright, I'm coming at you first."

"Go ahead."

That short exchange was the signal to start.

Dominique took a step forward and thrust. Letty parried, stepping
diagonally forward with her right foot and circling counterclockwise,
attempting to sweep her sword at Dominique, who was now right in front
of her. Dominique also circled to the right, sliding her sword up
against Letty's and trying to wrap around it. Determined not to let her,
Letty quickly pulled her sword back and stepped to the left, attempting
to block the side of Dominique's blade.

Dominique circled further to the right, closing to a distance where
their shoulders almost touched... no, she forced contact and shoved
Letty away with her shoulder. Sensing the movement just before, Letty
knew she couldn't avoid it and relaxed her body, allowing herself to be
knocked back.

Using that momentum, she dodged the follow-up horizontal sweep and
attempted to circle to Dominique's exposed left side, but she couldn't
catch her as Dominique had already slid away to the right.

When Letty stepped forward to pursue, Dominique launched a restraining
thrust. Letty received it with her shortsword, deflected it, and pressed
further forward. As if mocking her, Dominique then stepped lightly to
the left. Feeling she was about to be outflanked to the right, Letty
then pivoted clockwise on her left foot to create distance.

Or rather, she tried to.

Dominique, slick as an eel, stuck close to the retreating sword. Letty
attempted to parry the thrust aimed at her forehead as it whistled
through the air, and tried to wrap her sword around Dominique's, but
Dominique easily escaped. Instead, she targeted the wrist that Letty had
exposed, forcing her to hurriedly defend.

A clear *Clang!* rang out, followed immediately by another sharp sound.
Just as Letty thought she had blocked the attack aimed at her wrist, the
sword tip flicked up and targeted her head. She managed to block that
too, but immediately after, Dominique's sword tapped her right shoulder.

"There, point."

"...I yield."

Dominique spoke lightly, without a hint of being winded, while Letty was
deeply frustrated despite her steady breathing.

The rapid-fire exchange of offense and defense, which unfolded in an
instant, left the magistrate and knights speechless with open mouths.
For some reason, Ellie was looking at the magistrate and his men with a
smug look, as if to say, *How about that?*

The dimension of speed was on a completely different level. Even from a
distance, they could barely follow it with their eyes. Furthermore, the
accuracy in reading the opponent's intentions and the precision of the
technique were extraordinary. Most importantly, neither of them was even
breathing hard. They hadn't been moving at full speed.

Ignoring the stunned magistrate and his men, Dominique and Letty began a
casual post-mortem, as if nothing significant had happened:

"It would have been better not to pivot on your left foot there. It
automatically puts you on the defensive."

"My footing was off... I bet you were aiming for that..."

"Well, it means you need to acquire the skill to maintain the
offensive."

After a brief moment, Dominique turned back to the magistrate and his
men.

“...So, Magistrate-sama, what do you think of our skill?”

Though she spoke with a sly smile, as if the answer was already decided.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the wind-swept plains, master and apprentice stand side-by-side.

The look of bold fearlessness and the peerless grace of their
swordsmanship.

The shock rings out even to those far away.

Ruthlessly and mercilessly.
