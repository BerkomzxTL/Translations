## Chapter 126: A Nomad's Prerogative

Afterward, the caravan continued down the road, taking the now-calm
Tseren and her horse with them. Since they couldn't possibly put the
horse in a carriage, and the horse would only listen to Tseren, she had
no choice but to ride, despite knowing the risk was higher.

As a safety measure, Ellie, who could deploy a physical barrier, rode
alongside her while keeping pace with the carriage. Their positioning
was such that Tseren was sandwiched between the carriage and Ellie.

And, Dominique moved to the leading carriage. If the Gaschnar side had
anticipated failure and prepared a follow-up, there was a high
possibility of an ambush. The warrior escorts were also moved forward,
and Letty was assigned the role of moving freely as the situation
demanded.

The leader of the merchants, meanwhile, was in the safest-looking middle
carriage. He had insisted on riding in the front, but...

"If something comes up, your role is to witness everything to the very
end before. That's the responsibility of a boss, isn't it?" Dominique's
persuasion made him relent and accept the arrangement.

Yes, while the probability of an attack was low, if it did happen, it
meant the enemy was in full force. In that case, success was not
guaranteed as it had been in the previous battle. Though hidden beneath
a bold facade, everyone felt a significant tension.

Perhaps because of this, the caravan was somewhat quieter, but right
beside it, bright and cheerful voices could be heard.

"Oh my, so that's how you and Egret-sama met... It sounds just like a
story from a book!"

"Yes, it really is. And from there, well, there have been all sorts of
developments."

Tseren, being a girl her age, was naturally fond of such stories, and
she enjoyed listening to Ellie's two-hundred-percent-beautified tale of
their love. Though usually on the quieter side, Ellie was now clearly
enjoying herself as she boasted endlessly. Letty's expression on the
other hand was slightly clouded, perhaps because she could hear them
clearly despite the distance.

Yes, they were enjoying themselves.

But Ellie, and perhaps a few others, noticed that Tseren occasionally
glanced towards the caravan. Naturally, there were many merchants and
guards concerned about her well-being. This was her way of communicating
to them: *I'm fine, I'm alright now.*

"Geez, I said it's ten years too early for her to be worrying about us,"
Dominique mumbled.

"Now, now, it doesn't bother us, does it? So it's fine." A guard riding
with Dominique soothed her grumbling.

"I suppose so." Since she wasn't genuinely bothered, she just shrugged
lightly in response, as usual. "Maybe it's because of the customs in
their country, but she's pretty tough for a princess."

One of Cordor's customs was a coming-of-age ceremony where an
individual, regardless of gender or status, rides a horse alone and
spends a day and a night on the plains before returning. In fact, it
seemed the reason Tseren was riding alone was that she had been in the
middle of this tradition.

In Cordor, a country with nomadic roots, the ability to ride a horse and
travel the plains was an essential skill, even after settling down. This
applied to women and, perhaps, even more so to royalty. It was the way
of the plains life that those who cannot escape by their own means in an
emergency are abandoned. It wasn’t hard to imagine what kind of
treatment a female royal would receive if captured. In such an
environment, to be considered an adult, it was naturally expected that
she possessed the toughness to ride a horse alone and survive on the
plains.

"She's a little too honest and unguarded, though," Dominique pondered.

"That might be due to their national character. Cordor seems to have
less of the noble infighting and complications compared to Valandia or
Jurastin," One of the merchants called out from the back.

“I see,” Dominique replied, giving him a quick glance.

Cordor was a relatively younger nation compared to Valandia. Coupled
with their original spirit, it was said that there were fewer convoluted
political intrigues. If that was the case, Tseren's personality was
understandable.

"I've only visited a few times in the past, but it might be quite a
decent place to settle down."

"Haha, provided you don't mind the unique coldness of winter."

Cordor, being a country with relatively little rain, was particularly
dry in winter, with cold, arid winds blowing through. The chill, which
could effortlessly whisk away one’s body heat, alongside cracked skin
from the droughts, were among the common ailments of the region.

Dominique had already experienced this firsthand.

"What, are you saying it's too harsh for an old woman like me?" She shot
a glare toward the merchant.

"No, no, perish the thought! Just a general observation, a general
observation." He brushed things off with a polite smile.

*This merchant’s quite tough as well.* Dominique snorted lightly and
turned her attention back to the front.

\*\*\*

As expected, there were no attacks that day, and they reached the post
town without incident. Separating from the rest of the group heading to
the guild's warehouse, Letty, Ellie, Dominique, and the merchant
escorted Tseren to the magistrate's residence. Startled by the sudden
arrival, the magistrate rushed to the gate to greet them and then led
them inside.

After hearing Tseren's story, he knelt, gripping the hands of the
merchant and Letty, with tears streaming down his face as he offered his
gratitude. "You have saved her, you have truly saved her! Thank you,
thank you! Princess Tseren is the treasure of our nation, and you have
protected that treasure! Thank you truly!"

"Please, don't overstate it, please stop, um..." Tseren was left to
comfort the weeping magistrate, painting a bizarre picture.

That evening, Tseren, along with Dominique, Letty, and Ellie, stayed at
the magistrate's residence. The merchant returned to the caravan and was
scheduled to rejoin them the next morning.

"The welcome was quite something, wasn't it..." Letty murmured, sitting
on a chair in the guest room assigned to Tseren. They had been treated
lavishly, both because of Tseren's presence and because they were her
saviors.

Tseren also explained further, “He and my father grew up together from a
young age, so they are close friends. He’s always been so kind to me…”

They had politely declined most of the alcohol, stating they would be
leaving the next morning. However—

"Well, it's been a while, but the liquor here has a unique taste and
it’s quite delicious."

Dominique was happily gulping it down, as if she had been waiting for
the opportunity. And her expression hadn't changed at all. Letty felt a
little envious of her personality, her thick skin, and various other
qualities, even while acknowledging it was unreasonable.

"It's not really my style, but... after being welcomed like this, I feel
even more strongly that I have to deliver her safely." Of course, Letty
had no intention of failing, but she felt the burden had become slightly
heavier than before. Yet, it wasn't unpleasant; she even felt a surge of
motivation.

"Yes, that's right. We will definitely deliver her safely." Ellie smiled
beside her.

To be honest, she felt that nothing was impossible with Ellie by her
side. Especially with Dominique and the guards also present.

Tseren bowed to Letty and the others. "Everyone, thank you for
everything. I ask for your continued support tomorrow."

"You can count on us, Princess Tseren," Dominique accepted easily.

And as Letty and Ellie nodded in agreement, Tseren smiled back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the trade of selling their skills, showing off is a matter of course.

A fierce clash; the wind whips up early in the morning.

If you are near, come and see. The glint of the blade that can freeze
the heart.

A swordsman needs no words. ...Even if eloquent.
