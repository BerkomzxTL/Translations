## Chapter 112: Step by Step

After wrapping up the interrogation and giving the bandits some basic
medical care, the caravan started moving again. The formation was the
same as before, but with a bit more vigilance. It was understandable,
since it seemed this wasn't the usual route. The caravan moved on with
its usual speed, but the atmosphere was tense.

For a while after that, nothing happened. It was time for the second
break, so the carriages pulled over to the side of the road. Everyone
had a light meal and a drink, taking a short rest. Just while Letty was
catching her breath, Dominique came over to her.

"Alright, now that you've had a break, let's do a light practice. It’d
be reckless to go all out in this situation, so we'll take it easy."

"Understood. To be honest, I was wondering how you were going to do
this."

Letty nodded and stood up straight. Dominique's eyes narrowed for a
moment at the way she stood, then returned to normal.

"Letty-san, do your best! I'll be watching."

"...Yes, I'll work hard."

She smiled a little when Ellie, who was sitting next to her, spoke. She
patted her head gently. Ellie's face showed surprise for a moment before
breaking out into a slight, sloppy grin.

"Good grief, it’s hot in here."

"...? It's hot? It's kind of cold, actually."

"No, I don't mean that... never mind."

Letty's confused response left Dominique feeling deflated, so she
decided to gloss over her teasing.

\*\*\*

"Well, let's get back to it. First, take this."

Dominique handed Letty the wooden sword she had used during the last
break and took a little distance. She held her own in her left hand and
raised her right index finger.

"And as for what we're going to do. First, we'll start with footwork.
And another thing,” Dominique then held up her middle finger, waving the
two fingers as she spoke. “It's like grappling practice, but... I'll
teach you that as we go."

Letty nodded, "So we're starting with footwork. That’s a very
professional teaching approach."

"...It's a relief that you're so understanding. Most people would say
they already know how to walk."

She smiled happily seeing Letty's honest reaction and her ability to
understand the depth of meaning in that one word.

In truth, people had asked her for lessons before. But whenever she
tried to teach them, she was always met with resistance, with them
saying, "I already know that." She knew that the people who knew the
least were the ones who said they knew the most.

"To be honest, I'm interested in your elusive movements."

"Yeah, you're so understanding it's almost scary. But on the other hand,
your movements are easy to read. To put it simply, they're too
straightforward. But since you're so fast that a normal person can't
hope to stop you, it probably hasn’t been a problem."

Letty nodded, showing her understanding and agreement with Dominique's
analysis. In their last bout, her thrust was parried. And with ease, at
that. She had never experienced anything like that before. There was one
person who seemed like they could give her a counterattack even faster
than she could parry, but that’s a different story.

"That said, the difficult part is that I'm not telling you not to move
in a straight line. Of course, there are situations where that's the
best option. You have to be able to switch your movements instantly
depending on the situation. But we'll practice that later. For now,
let's work on curvilinear movement."

"Understood, please show me."

With that, Dominique moved to stand directly in front of Letty.

"First, stand properly. Straighten your back as if you're being hung by
a string from the top of your head, and don't put your weight on either
foot… You're already doing all that, so that's a big help. I don't have
to teach you from scratch."

"Ah, I was trained quite a bit on that."

Ellie, who was watching from the side, timidly raised her hand, "...Um,
excuse me for interrupting. Do you really have to practice standing?"

When she looked closely, there was something different about Dominique
and Letty's posture and bearing compared to others. Just by standing
still, they gave off an air of effortless grace, as if they were
weightless.

"Ah, that's why you usually have to practice footwork to learn how to
stand, and then footwork to learn how to walk. And learning how to stand
is so tedious that most people run away from it. But Egret here has
already mastered it, so we can start with the easier part."

"Is that so… It's a lot more profound than I thought."

"I never found it that tedious... But I don't know if it's the same
method."

Letty couldn’t relate to Dominique and Ellie’s discussion. In reality,
she had been subjected to an absurd amount of repetitive practice, but
she had nothing to compare it to. There had been many times when she was
made to practice just standing and walking all day long.

"If you want, Ellie, you can practice standing, too. It's not a bad
skill for a mage to learn. If you ask, I'm sure Egret will teach you
everything from A to Z," Dominique spoke teasingly.

"Will Letty-san teach me? Slowly, meticulously, and thoroughly?" Ellie
responded like a puppy wagging its tail.

Nearly taken aback by her enthusiasm, Letty replied with a hint of
confusion, "...I don't mind teaching you, but isn't that a strange way
to put it, Ellie?"

Dominique, the instigator, watched them from the side with a smirk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walking. Turning. Daily actions that we take for granted.

Is there any wasted motion? Are these actions truly necessary?

The answer she found after deep contemplation.

Up Next: Like Flowing Water

Or, perhaps, like a philosophy.
