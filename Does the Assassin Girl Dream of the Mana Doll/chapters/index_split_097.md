## Chapter 120: Crimson Rondo

"Two people charging at us from the front!"

"What?!"

The commander couldn't help but exclaim after hearing the report.

They had already lost nearly half their numbers to a magic attack of
unexpected power, and now two companions of such a high-level mage were
charging at them despite their numbers advantage. Their actions, and
more importantly, the movement of the two figures as seen by his own
eyes...

*Dangerous.*

Those two were genuinely dangerous. His instincts as a warrior screamed
the loudest possible warning. If they remained on their mounts, they
would be taken out. They wouldn't be able to lift a finger. They would
be utterly crushed. That was his gut feeling.

"All personnel dismount! Two on each flank stay on your horses! The four
of you, keep pursuing! The rest of us will deal with these two!"

*Can the girl be captured before she reaches the caravan? ...No,
probably not.*

But if those four could somehow stall her while they defeated the two
charging fighters and caught up... Surely, even if the two were skilled,
even they would be overwhelmed by a dozen men.

His calculation itself was not wrong. That is, if his opponents were
ordinary people.

\*\*\*

"Dominique, four of them are breaking through."

"It's fine. Ellie can handle two, and the others can take care of the
rest."

They conversed while running, confirming the situation. ...Neither of
them was even close to being out of breath. And they were moving so fast
that they gave the enemy no time to scatter further or evade.

"Looks like they're serious. ...Ah, the one a little behind the center
is probably the commander."

"Then that one is a definite capture. The others, as much as possible,
right?"

"How about we make a contest out of who can capture more?"

"...I'll pass. I don't feel like I can win yet."

Letty furrowed her brows in a troubled expression as Dominique smirked.
She had thought she had the advantage in physical ability due to her
youth, so why could Dominique run at the same speed as her with such
ease? *It's unreasonable*, she thought.

"Haha, that's humble of you. Well, I'll say you know your limits, too.
Alright, enough joking. Here we go."

"...I'm not exactly thrilled, but... understood."

They clashed with the men who had dismounted and drawn their swords
while exchanging such a light-hearted back-and-forth.

And so.

Two storms danced across the prairie, painting it red.

\*\*\*

Confused by the momentum of the two charging without hesitation, the men
raised their swords and... the instant they got within range, they
slashed at the figure that should have been there.

"...Huh?"

She should have been there. But she wasn't. If the attack had been
parried or dodged, that would be one thing. But…

*Not there?*

It was a confusion that lasted less than a second.

A fatally long second.

The sensation of his own wrist being severed violently snapped him back
to reality.

"Guwaaaah!?"

His own scream forced him to retain consciousness. Before the cry faded,
his knees buckled. He realized his knees had been slashed a few seconds
later. Unable to do anything, he crumpled to the ground, unable to do
anything but scream in pain.

*What happened?*

*What was that?*

*Was that human?*

The fear and confusion completely robbed the man of his will to fight.

\*\*\*

*Move. Move. Move.*

Her body obeyed her will entirely. No, her body was drawing out her
will.

*Observe. Observe. Move.*

The opponent's movements appeared with a clarity that made them seem
slow. Her thoughts unconsciously dictated how she should move, and
before she knew it, she was moving.

She stepped into the opponent's right flank and rotated her body. Using
that rotation, she sliced off his wrist. Another full rotation and she
slashed the back of his knee. As the man collapsed, she caught sight of
the next target in the corner of her eye.

Using the momentum of the rotation, she leaped forward. Surprised by
Letty's sudden jump into his range, the man froze for a moment.

"Too slow," she muttered under her breath.

She smoothly guided her short sword along the longsword of the
dumbfounded man, entangling it as if winding a spool. The instant his
grip slackened, she twisted it out of his hand and used the momentum to
smash his knee. As she pulled away, she turned her short sword and
struck him on the back of the head with the blunt side. It wouldn't
knock him out easily, but it would keep him incapacitated for a while.

And as she moved toward the next opponent, she was inwardly amazed. *I
see, that's why they charged.*

No matter how skilled the two were, even they would have been quickly
finished off by attacks from all sides if they had recklessly charged
into the dense group. But the enemy had scattered to avoid Ellie's
attack.

By finishing off each opponent in one or two strikes, they only had to
deal with one or two enemies simultaneously. It was a situation where
the true value of the two could be put fully on display.

"I guess I should learn things like this too…" Letty muttered to
herself, deflecting the sword of the man who swung at her, sliding into
his flank as she parried, circling around, and swinging her sword
sideways to slash his upper arm.

She felt a strange dissonance from the impact. *Did it always cut this
easily?*

It was the same just now; she didn't think her sword had this much
power. It cut so easily, she could move on without stopping. It felt
surreal.

As she fluidly moved to her next opponent, she avoided his thrusting
sword by a hair's breadth and sliced off the wrist holding the weapon.
Because of the difference in reach, she was aiming for wrists instead of
vital points near the center of the body. What Dominique had taught her
during their sparring practice was being executed perfectly.

Turning the tip of the sword back after severing the limb, she slashed
the man's knee, and then moved on to the next. ...This was the man
Dominique had identified as the commander.

"What! What in the world are you!?"

Though he cried out in panic, his stance was flawless. However, to the
current Letty, it was something that posed no threat and lacked
intimidation. With a seemingly careless movement, she stepped
closer—just out of reach, yet close enough to read his eyes and
movements.

Though his stance was without flaw, he seemed to be shaken. Thinking he
could reach her, the commander raised his sword and brought it down.

However, witnessing her parry with ease, he realized he had misjudged.
Still, due to the reach difference, the opponent's attack surely
couldn't reach him. Keeping that in mind, he stood his ground and swept
his sword horizontally.

He was stunned to find no one there.

Intuiting the commander's intention to sweep to the right, Letty had
immediately stepped in, circling to his left flank. To him, she must
have seemed to have suddenly vanished. It was commendable that he
noticed in less than a second and tried to turn towards her.

With small steps, Letty slid across the ground, moving behind the man.

"That makes five."

With that, Letty drove her sword deep across the shoulder of the man's
right, sword-wielding arm. Using the momentum of the slash, she crouched
and, in a spin, delivered another slash. With both his left and right
knees cut, the man collapsed. Then, she stabbed his left shoulder,
completely robbing him of his freedom of movement.

"Next... huh?"

Letty looked around for her next opponent, but there was no one left
standing. No one, except for Dominique.

"Haha, that's impressive, truly. You're even utilizing it in a real
fight. Well, I win the match, though," Dominique spoke casually while
leisurely making her way over. Beyond her, six men were sprawled on the
ground.

"I didn't say I’d compete. Besides, I'm the one who secured the
commander." Letty said this as she held the commander down while sitting
on his back and stuffing a cloth she took out into his mouth. A
precaution against suicide.

"Well, I suppose I'll call it a draw then. And your method of securing
him is passable," Dominique laughed lightly.

Seeing this, Letty couldn't help but feel that she was still far from
being able to compete with her.

\*\*\*

"Wow. They really took down the whole group with just the two of
them..."

After securing the fleeing girl, Ellie took down the two men who
followed, just as Dominique had predicted they would. The remaining two
were shot down by the guards' arrows and captured alive. During that
commotion, the two of them had already subdued the group of over ten
men.

"I knew it, but Dominique-san is truly something else."

Even from a distance, the two of them were phenomenal. Dominique's fluid
and fierce movements were particularly eye-catching. Ellie felt a little
frustrated by that.

However, that was that, and this was this. Since the matter was resolved
without major incident, she had to do what needed to be done and turned
back to the girl.

"It's alright now. Are you injured at all?"

Even after calling out, there was no reply. *Huh?* she thought, looking
at the girl's face.

"...Amazing..."

The girl was looking at the two in the distance with sparkling eyes.

*Maybe… Will this turn into a big problem?*

That thought crossed Ellie's mind.

Even on plains swept by dry winds, flowers bloom.

Rooted to the earth, graceful and modest.

The name of the flower, colored in soft pale purple, is...

Up Next: Cordor’s Grassland Wisteria

Strong enough not to be plucked.
