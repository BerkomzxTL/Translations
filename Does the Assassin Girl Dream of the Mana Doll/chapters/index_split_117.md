## Chapter 140: Howl, Sword

"Now, let's talk about how to actually use what you’ve cultivated."

With that preamble, Dominique took a distance and picked up her wooden
sword. She lightly swung it once, as if checking its condition.

"First, just swing it sideways using only your arm. Lightly, just to
check the feeling."

"Got it."

Letty swung her arm lightly as instructed. It felt the same as always.

"Next. Straighten your back, and rotate your body around an axis passing
through your center, aiming to use the muscles around your upper back
here. Once you grasp that feeling, try swinging your arm again using
that body movement."

"Huh, here... um..."

Dominique, who had moved behind Letty at some point, gently tapped the
muscles around Letty's spine and shoulder blades. Letty performed the
upper body rotation a few times, trying to utilize those muscles. *I
see, it feels somehow different than usual.*

Just as she thought she was starting to grasp the feeling, she swung her
arm. *Whoosh!* It felt like her arm was being whipped around with an
unprecedented force. She stopped the movement and stared at her hand,
wondering what had happened.

"Good, good, well done. Repeat that movement about ten more times to
ingrain the feeling into your body."

Letty nodded and proceeded to dutifully swing her arm about ten times.
She felt the movement becoming more familiar and the sharpness
intensifying with each swing. The sensation was so intriguing that she
kept swinging past ten times.

"Hold it, hold it. I understand the feeling, but stop there. The next
step is more interesting," Dominique chided.

"Eh, u-um yeah." Letty abruptly stopped and stared intently, determined
not to miss the next instruction.

"And now, for the real deal. The first important thing is to keep your
feet planted. Normally, you let them go with the flow, but you tighten
them firmly only when striking. Specifically, your left foot needs to
firmly brace when swinging from right to left, and your right foot when
swinging from left to right."

As she spoke, Dominique demonstrated, swinging her arm and bracing her
feet. With each swing to the right and left, she saw how Dominique
planted her foot with a natural, walking motion, firmly absorbing the
momentum.

"...You make it look easy, but isn't that quite difficult?"

"Well, simply bracing to absorb the force isn't hard. However,
maximizing the strike's power is incredibly difficult. You see, bracing
slows down the momentum. To achieve maximum power, you must plant your
foot firmly only at the instant the sword makes contact."

"With that much power you could definitely cut a sword..."

Convinced, Letty tried the movement a few times herself. Knowing the key
points, she felt like she was doing it well, but at the same time still
not quite there.

"And bracing the feet is necessary to fully unleash the power of the hip
joint. The movement itself is what they call 'putting your hips into
it.' I think you should be able to do it now."

"Now... Yes, I see, I'll try it."

Letty nodded and took her stance. She opened her feet roughly
shoulder-width apart and took a deep breath. She stepped forward with
her right foot, and the moment it hit the ground, she drove her hip in.
She didn't twist her waist, but rotated her body by tightening her hip
joint, using that force to turn her hips. She focused on her body axis
so as not to kill the rotational force, adding back muscle power to
amplify the spin. Her arm, from the shoulder blade outward, was swung
out with the image of a flying whip.

A sharp sound of the air being sliced.

She instantly felt a dull throbbing pain in her fingertips. She stared
at them with a bewildered look.

"How is it? Do your fingertips hurt? That's proof you swung it well."

"Yes, it's a strange pain... a dull, throbbing feeling."

The pain was caused by the slight bursting of capillaries in her
fingertips due to the excessively sharp swing. Unfortunately, she didn't
understand the physiological reason, but she knew for sure that her arm
and hand had moved in a way they never had before.

"Well then, what happens when you actually turn that into a sword
movement... You're curious, aren't you? Conveniently, there's a
magnificent tree right there. Try hitting that."

Where Dominique was pointing, there was a large tree. Letty nodded and
walked toward it. She gripped the wooden sword, readjusting her grip a
few times as if checking its condition.

She let out a breath, staring intensely at her target. And took her
stance.

She exhaled softly and stepped forward. The sound of her breath was
immediately drowned out by the roar of the wooden sword. A high-pitched
howl she had never heard. A speed she had never felt.

And a shock she had never experienced.

The wooden sword, which had gouged the large tree with a heavy sound,
dropped from her hand. Her right hand was numb and trembling from the
impact.

"Oh, wow. That's something. To generate that much power on your first
try. Maybe my teaching is just that good." Dominique approached, her
voice a mix of admiration and teasing.

Letty, who had been staring blankly at her right hand, slowly looked up
at Dominique. "...What was that?"

"What? That was your true power. Although it's still rough, unrefined,
and has plenty of room for improvement."

Dominique picked up Letty's sword from the ground and held out the
handle. Since her right hand was still numb, Letty took it with her
left.

"That was my true... power..."

"Even so, it's not yet usable in a real fight. You can't drop your sword
every time, can you?"

"That's certainly true..."

"First, you need to check, adjust, and practice your grip. Just focusing
on that will drastically reduce how often you’ll drop your sword, and
most importantly, the power will be properly transmitted, further
increasing the impact. Your movement isn't fully integrated yet, so that
also requires practice. But, well, it's impressive that the wooden sword
didn't break with that kind of power. That means your blade was properly
aligned."

Letty looked down at the wooden sword in her hand. Indeed, the area of
impact was slightly chipped, but the sword itself was neither bent nor
warped. It had correctly absorbed the enormous shock.

"I see... I'm a little happy, but very frustrated. I need to practice
more..."

"That's the spirit. But practice correctly, okay? If you do, eventually
your hands will look like this—" Dominique opened her hand and showed it
to her.

Letty stared at the palm for a moment. She blinked repeatedly, checking
as if she couldn't believe what she was seeing.

It was the well-worn hand of someone who wielded a sword every day. The
hand that had swung a sword for as many years as she had lived was—

"Wait, what is this...? Why are there no calluses or blisters...?"

"That, my dear, is the result of correct practice. If you swing with the
right grip and the right distribution of force, the power gets properly
dispersed. Calluses form because the load is concentrated only in those
spots, meaning the grip isn't perfect."

"I see, now that you mention it, that might be true..."

She looked at her own right palm. She didn't have blisters or calluses,
but the reddened areas of her hand appeared unevenly. She had just been
taught, painfully, that this was wrong.

"...I still have a long way to go."

"Of course. It took me years, too. But since I'm here to shorten that
process as much as possible you can just stick with me."

A confident grin.

Letty nodded honestly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The power that sleeps within her feels like it belongs to another
person.

She draws it out, piece by piece, and refines it.

Not enough. Nowhere near enough for what she desires.

Up Next: Her Desired Future

It will surely be there, so long as she does not stop walking.
