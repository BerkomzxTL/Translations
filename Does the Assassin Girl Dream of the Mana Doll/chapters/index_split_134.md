## Chapter 157: The Crucible of Fervor

"Well, I'll be. She's even better than I heard, that Egret!"

Batbayar said this, and then took a swig from his cup. He loudly gulped
the drink down before exhaling cheerfully, pouring another cup, and then
looking over at Dominique beside him.

"How is she, sister, as a teacher?"

"Haha, well, she gets a passing grade, I suppose."

Dominique also casually emptied her glass. Batbayar looked puzzled for a
moment, then his expression turned to one of understanding, and he
smiled.

"Ah, because it’ll end too quickly like this, and there won't be enough
to nibble on with the drinks?"

"That would be demanding too much of the audience. Sometimes she's too
linear… Ah, like right now, for instance."

Where Dominique pointed, Egret charged straight in, narrowly evaded her
opponent's sword, and struck him down with a single blow. To a
bystander, it looked perfectly adequate.

"The man nearby didn't know what to do, so he couldn't react. If those
guys had teamed up two-on-one, the attack might have come from the side.
I'd like her to be a bit more cautious about things like that."

The opponents in question were just struck down, but thinking about it,
one couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if they had
coordinated.

"You're tough on Egret."

"Well, of course. I want to demand the absolute highest standard from
that girl."

Batbayar stared intently at Dominique, who was wearing a somewhat
feigned, composed expression. Suddenly, he grinned.

"I see. You approve of her enough to feel comfortable making such high
demands, don't you?"

"...Your Majesty is quite something."

Saying this, Dominique turned her gaze back toward the arena as if
trying to escape. She watched as Letty struck down yet another person.

"But still. The way she handled the first five was excellent. She
probably had the whole sequence choreographed in her head beforehand.
Well, the parts after that are impromptu, so there are still areas that
need work."

Even while she was talking, another person collapsed weakly to the
ground. Before they knew it, only one remained.

"Say, sister. Who's stronger, Egret or you when you won the tournament?"
Batbayar posed the question with amusement.

Dominique smiled wryly. "You really are something else, Your Majesty."
She returned her gaze to the arena. "If you compare me back then to
Egret now, honestly, Egret is superior."

She narrowed her eyes, watching Egret's swordsmanship. Then, she turned
back to Batbayar with a somewhat smug expression.

"After all, I didn't have a decent teacher back then, but she has me
now."

"I see, that's undeniable."

Batbayar nodded repeatedly and took another drink from his cup.

\*\*\*

"Wow... Amazing..."

Tseren was staring at the vivid spectacle unfolding before her eyes,
even forgetting to blink. She knew Letty's skill was formidable. But
seeing her now, confidently holding her own against a group of proven
fighters… It looked like her skills had improved even further in just a
short time.

"Hehehehe... Isn't she amazing? Isn't she cool!" Ellie interjected,
clearly delighted and proud.

Letty had delivered on her promise to show off her cool side and was now
just one step away from winning. Ellie thought her behavior was
acceptable, carried away by thinking it was all for her.

"Yes, yes, I truly, truly think she's wonderful." Tseren nodded
earnestly, watching Letty with eyes that sparkled like a child's. Yes,
it was somewhat similar to a child looking at an admired hero.

"And, I truly envy Ellie-sama for having such a wonderful husband."

"N-No, come on, Princess Tseren, flattery won't get you anywhere."

If anything, she was radiating a pink aura; it was practically leaking
out of her. Tseren refrained from commenting on that though and turned
her attention back to the arena.

The chilling atmosphere from before had completely vanished, and the
audience was highly enthusiastic. That was understandable. After all, a
woman who looked delicate and weak was effortlessly making fools of
grown men and striking them down with incredible skill.

"...Hmm, but I think... what I want is not a husband like Egret-sama."

"Huh? Is that so? Is there something lacking in Letty-san? No, well, of
course, I have no intention of letting her go."

Tseren seemed to have grown bolder, as she was able to smile even when
pierced by Ellie’s somewhat murky gaze. She turned back to the arena
with a composed expression.

***““Only one left! Only one left!””***

The cheers echoing were surprisingly pleasant.

"I think I want to be like Egret-sama. I don't want a husband; I want to
be like her."

Tseren's smile looked somehow more mature.

\*\*\*

"...I see, that's the woman you were concerned about."

In the highest section of the spectator stands, in a secluded corner. A
man in a robe with a hood spoke to the man next to him. It was none
other than the fully armored contestant who had just carried out the
one-sided massacre in the first round.

The armored man didn't speak, but gave a small nod.

"She's probably the only obstacle, I suppose. But I don't think she's a
match for you."

In terms of speed and power, the armored man was clearly superior. It
seemed highly unlikely that he could lose.

The armored man slightly shook his head at the robed man's words.

***“That woman is more than what she seems.”***

A muffled voice echoed. It was a terribly low, thick voice, like a deep
rumbling.

"Hmm... if you say so, then it must be true. But if you understand that
much, there won't be any problems, will there?"

The armored man nodded slightly again. At that moment, the final
opponent was struck down, and the arena erupted in deafening cheers.

The person left standing was the one they had expected.

"I've seen what I needed to see. Let's go."

The robed man turned to leave, and the armored man gave a small nod. He
turned back one last time, flashing a knowing smile toward the
long-haired woman in the center of the cheering arena, who seemed
bewildered by the massive ovation.

**“I'm back from hell.”**

Muttering just those words.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cheers she received, the enthusiasm pouring down.

She’s perplexed by this new experience.

Why is the reaction so intense?

She alone seems unaware of the magnitude of what she has accomplished.

It is the first step into a world where the light shines.
