## Chapter 106: A Merchant's Spirit

The sounds of lively chatter and bustle filled the air. In a corner of
the merchant's warehouse, the loading of cargo bound for the royal
capital of Cordor was in full swing.

"Hey, grab this too!"

"Gotcha! This one goes... on this carriage! Hey, that's not the right
one, it goes over there!"

The men, seemingly enjoying the hustle and bustle, skillfully loaded the
carriages. In the hands of these muscular men, even heavy-looking
packages seemed light. A large quantity of cargo was stacked, made as
compact as possible, with no space wasted.

Letty watched from a distance.

As someone not suited for manual labor, she had no role to play, and in
fact, she had been told not to interfere. So, she simply watched the
scene unfold.

"So this is how these things are transported," she said to Ellie.

"Yes. We had supply transport when I was in the army, too, but that was
a behind-the-scenes job."

While not an unfamiliar sight, getting involved in it as a job for the
first time gave her a fresh impression. After all, this was her first
time accepting an escort-type request. Letty wasn't counting the
incident in Valandia, since that was a mission to eliminate an assassin,
not a guard job.

"Yes, it's a common sight for us merchants, but it might be rare for
adventurers like Egret-san," said a voice from behind her.

She turned to see the merchant, the owner of the trading company and the
client for this job, approaching with a pleasant smile. Though appearing
amicable, his eyes seemed to be constantly appraising and evaluating
everything he saw. That steady gaze gave her a sense of reassurance,
rather than discomfort. At the very least, Letty trusted this merchant's
capabilities.

"We mostly take on monster extermination requests," Letty explained.
"...This is commonplace, is it? It must be. So many people need so many
things."

"Yes, I believe so. That's why people like us exist, and I'm proud of
it."

He wasn't puffing out his chest. His posture was, as always, humble yet
upright. But the pride in his words was evident. It was remarkably
dazzling.

"Please forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn, but… is it especially
important this time, since a lot of the cargo is medicine?"

"Hmm... as a merchant, I don't like to talk about superior or inferior
goods. However, in terms of pressing necessity and preparation for the
worst-case scenario, you are correct. At the same time, our other goods
are just as important, so it's a difficult and interesting problem."

"...Difficult, yet interesting?" Letty tilted her head.

The merchant's eyes narrowed in amusement seeing her puzzled.

"Yes, if I may be so bold, I would say it's interesting. It's enjoyable
to think about what kind of goods will be desired and appreciated. But
my heart truly leaps when I imagine how the items I deliver will be of
use to everyone. That goes for medicine, and also spices—what kind of
dishes will they be used in?

“Jewels are a prime example: who will wear them, how will they wear
them, or will they be given as a gift? They add a little color to
people's lives. Besides the practical benefits, I also want to
contribute to those small luxuries."

He spoke cheerfully and eloquently. Perhaps even more so than when he
was negotiating with Dominique or trying to recruit them. This was
likely the essence of this man, or at least a large part of it. Letty
found it very agreeable.

"Oh, I see. ...I know someone who talks about wanting common people to
enjoy art, and that sounds somewhat similar."

"Haha, my aspirations aren't quite so lofty... But yes, you're right,
art is good, too. Like jewelry, beauty certainly enriches the heart.
...And when the heart is enriched, the purse strings tend to loosen a
little."

The last remark was delivered with a mischievous smile. It was both a
joke and the honest truth. It felt like a display of his balanced
sensibility as a merchant.

"You're... quite shrewd," Letty observed.

"Indeed. If we merchants don't make a profit, we quickly go out of
business. And if that happens, our employees and their families will be
left on the streets, and their resentment will surely be directed at
me!"

He spoke lightly, but it was probably the truth. For himself. For his
employees. These were not conflicting ideals for him; rather, they
existed as goals that were likely one and the same. At least, that's how
Letty perceived it.

Therefore—

"I see... Yes, that makes sense. Well, I'll do my best to make sure no
resentment is directed at you."

"If you and your friends are doing their best, then there is nothing
that could be more reassuring! Egret-san, Ellie-san, please take care of
*them* and the cargo," the merchant said, bowing his head.

It was minor, but he mentioned the people before the cargo. It was a
detail that resonated unexpectedly with Letty. It was a very comforting
thing to hear.

"Leave it to me. We’ll ensure they get delivered safely."

"Yes, you can count on us," Ellie confirmed.

The two of them answered together. A strange sense of motivation surged
within her. It was surprising, but not unpleasant; rather, it was a nice
feeling.

\*\*\*

Eventually, the loading was complete, and it was time to depart.
Dominique was on the driver's seat of a carriage, while Letty and Ellie
remained on their horses. A few other hired warriors were on the
carriages or on the driver's seats. Once the positions were decided, all
that was left was to go.

"I leave this to you. Everyone, please take care."

His voice was gentle and cheerful, but there was a glint of seriousness
in his eyes. They accepted his gaze and nodded sincerely.

This job, in many ways, would be a new experience.

With that premonition, Letty urged her horse forward, moving in sync
with the departing wagons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You never know what might happen or when.

However, it's not impossible to make predictions.

The accumulation of such preparations ensures a safe journey.

Or, perhaps, a small sense of satisfaction.
