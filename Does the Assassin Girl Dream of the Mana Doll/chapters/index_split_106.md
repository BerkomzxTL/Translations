## Chapter 129: Undulation

"Well, attacking right in front of the magistrate should at least save
us some effort," Dominique commented after tying up the two unconscious
men and burying the third.

"Indeed.” The magistrate next to her, who had been giving instructions
for the cleanup, nodded. “We’ll need to extract information from these
rogues, but the addition of my testimony about the actual attack should
move His Majesty to action."

"I'll leave that part to you. But still, to strike this close to the
royal capital... they must have been desperate." She looked down at the
still-unconscious men, speaking in a tone of exasperation.

Both were skilled enough to withstand a strike from Letty; they were
clearly not mere low-level soldiers. They could be expected to possess a
decent amount of information.

"Leave the interrogation to us. We have experts for that here," he
followed up.

"That's reassuring. Oh, that reminds me.” Dominique then called over
Letty. “How about it, Egret? Would you like to observe the methods of an
interrogation specialist?"

Letty frowned with a troubled expression. "No, I don't particularly want
to become a specialist... and I have other things to do."

Seeing her make a sour face, Dominique laughed and waved her hand
dismissively, saying it was just a joke. Looking a little sulky, Letty
then left and headed towards Ellie and Tseren, who were chatting.

The magistrate watched her retreating figure and murmured, "...You, of
course, but that girl is also amazing. What kind of life has she led to
have acquired such swordsmanship at that age?"

His gaze held a mix of awe and pity. As a man who wielded a sword, he
understood the level of her skill. And he could imagine the extent of
the training and time required to acquire it. Or, perhaps, one should
say he couldn't help but imagine.

Dominique also looked on in the direction her apprentice had left, but
the corner of her lips was turned up. "It's uncouth to pry into a
woman's past. And even if something *did* happen, if she's trying to
walk the right path now, isn't that good enough?"

"...Ah, well, that's true."

If the magistrate had seen Letty fight before receiving Dominique's
training, he might have seen through her background. In that case, he
would never have allowed her to be placed near Tseren. Although
Dominique hadn't explicitly confirmed it, she could infer a lot from the
movements she'd seen when they first met.

"...I suppose this is what you call destiny."

"Hmm? Did you say something?"

"No, nothing important."

The magistrate couldn’t quite catch her small mutter and questioned her,
but Dominique brushed it off. Then, she looked towards Letty again.
Perhaps that carefree conversation between the three wouldn't have been
possible originally.

If she had changed that girl's life, even just a little…. And, perhaps,
for the better.

"It's certainly amusing."

She whispered, so quietly that no one could hear.

\*\*\*

"Welcome back, Letty-san." As Letty approached, Ellie offered a prepared
towel and water bottle.

"Ah, thank you, Ellie." Letty smiled as she accepted them, lightly wiped
her sweat, and sighed. Then, she brought the water bottle directly to
her mouth and drank. It was lightly flavored with lemon juice and honey.

After drinking a good amount, she sighed again.

She wasn't physically exhausted, but mentally she was quite tired.
Although the result could be called an overwhelming victory, the truth
was that it was a tactical win for Dominique. Even though she couldn’t
see herself losing, they were opponents whom she couldn’t afford to
underestimate.

As Letty was deep in thought, Tseren approached, giggling. "Fufu, as
expected of the wife, your preparations for welcoming her are perfect."

*Guh,* Letty choked involuntarily. She was truly glad she hadn't been
drinking at that exact moment.

Ellie covered her blushing cheeks with both hands. "Oh, Princess Tseren,
please don't tease me like that\\ ♪"

Tseren looked on fondly. "No, no. I just think again how well-suited you
two are."

*Indeed, this side of Ellie is also cute*, Letty thought to herself,
though careful not to say it aloud.

Then, Tseren suddenly turned to Egret with a serious expression and
bowed her head. "Egret-sama, thank you for your hard work, and truly,
thank you very much."

Letty blinked a few times before hurriedly waving her hand dismissively.
"No, it's fine. It's just my job. So please, raise your head; I feel
awkward."

She still hadn't gotten used to being bowed to or thanked. It never
happened during her time as an assassin, and she didn't feel like she
was doing anything worthy of such words. She felt that the sentiment of
‘we're all in this together’ was the most accurate, yet the princess in
front of her was offering words of deep gratitude. It was, somehow,
utterly embarrassing.

...Suddenly, Ellie pinched her arm.

"...It's not what you think. It's not, okay?"

"I know, but still..."

They conversed in a low hush, their expressions unchanged. It seemed she
had been pinched in a place Tseren couldn't see.

"You really are close. ...Um, Egret-sama. How did you acquire such
swordsmanship skills?"

"Huh? Well... only through training." Confronted by the sudden question,
Letty could only offer a vague response. But it wasn't that she didn't
remember what kind of training she'd done.

After hearing her answer, Tseren remained silent for a moment, then
looked up again. "Um, if I trained, could I become like you too?"

"Like me? ...I really wouldn't recommend that, but... Well, I can't say
for sure that you could, either..." As she spoke, she looked at Tseren's
body again. She didn't have the impression of being delicately frail, as
a princess might. Although slender, her skeletal structure and muscles
seemed well-developed. If one considered that she could ride a horse for
that long, she certainly wasn't lacking in basic physical fitness.

Even so.

"More than anything, I don't think you, Princess Tseren, really need to
acquire swordsmanship."

"That's true... I know that if I were to half-heartedly pick it up, it
might just cause trouble for everyone... But seeing women like you,
Egret-sama, and Ellie-sama, and Dominique-sama… All three of you are
truly dazzling. I know it's a foolish aspiration, but I can't help it."

She spoke while thinking, occasionally stumbling over her words. Yet,
she looked directly at Letty. Letty couldn't dismiss the words spun with
such sincerity.

She thought about it and tried to answer as earnestly as possible in her
own words. "I won't say you *can* do it. I won't say definitely that you
*can't* either. You won't know unless you try. But if you start
half-heartedly, I think you'll just end up not understanding anything."

Tseren fell into thought.

‘Not doing it half-heartedly’ held a few interpretations… *Do I have the
time for it? Do I have the resolve to cast aside almost everything
else?*

"It's okay if you can't decide right away. So, I think you should take
your time to think about it."

"...Thank you. I’ll think carefully."

Tseren smiled.

Who was it who said, "People are the castle, people are the stone
walls"?¹

The capital, a city of people, built upon the plains as a moat and
solidified with compassion, lies before their eyes.

The unfamiliar city, the nation. The story it tells is of an unknown
beyond.

Up Next: The Capital of the Plains

Does the wind blowing through carry peace, or danger?
