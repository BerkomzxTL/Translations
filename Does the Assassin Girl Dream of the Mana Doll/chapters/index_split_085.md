## Chapter 108: Swordplay on the Plains

"Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we get started?"

"Mh, understood."

When Dominique came, Letty stood up. …While at the same time apologizing
internally to the slightly displeased Ellie. She told her she'd be back
and headed toward Dominique. Evidently curious, Ellie followed behind.

"Alright, let's keep it light today, just a spar to gauge each other's
strength. You use this one."

Dominique spoke casually as she tossed a wooden sword, which Letty
caught in mid-air. Even before she caught it, a shiver ran down her
spine. She looked intently at the sword, examining it, gripping it, and
checking its balance.

"...Did you make this?"

"Ah, I saw your short sword the other day, so I just whipped this up
quickly. I couldn't get the weight quite right, but the length should be
close, isn’t it?"

"More than close... it's the exact length."

"Is that so? That's impressive. Well done, me."

Letty sighed lightly, watching Dominique laugh heartily with obvious
pleasure. She wasn't sure if Dominique had made it that easily, but it
was true that the wooden sword felt incredibly natural in her hand. The
length, of course, but the weight distribution was also maximized to
match her own short sword. She swung it lightly to check the feel.
...She was confident she could use it with almost no sense of
difference.

"I think it’s truly remarkable. Why don't you try becoming a wooden
sword craftsman?"

"Oh, you've got some sass. Ah, well, if I set up a dojo, let the
assistant instructor handle it, and live comfortably off the dojo's
income, I wouldn't mind just making wooden swords," Dominique gave her a
meaningful look while chuckling.

Letty fired back with a firm refusal, "...I'm not going to be an
assistant instructor, so that’s not happening, okay?"

Lately, she had become much better at reading things that weren't
explicitly stated. Though, in Dominique's case, it might just be that
she’s being intentionally blatant.

"That's a shame. I think you'd make a great poster girl."

"...Are your eyes full of holes? Me, a poster girl... I think the dojo
would definitely go bankrupt."

"No way! If Letty-san was the poster girl for a dojo, I'd invest my
entire fortune!!"

"Yes, Ellie, thank you. But, sorry, I'll have to politely decline that
one."

There was a moment of confusion as someone jumped into the conversation
from an unexpected direction. She thought about the image the word
"poster girl" conjured up in her limited imagination. *...A definite
no*, she shook her head. *Absolutely impossible.*

"Well, that's a discussion for another time. For now, let's talk with
these," Dominique said.

Seeing her raise her wooden sword, Letty nodded and took her own stance.
"No, there will be no 'another time,' I'm definitely not doing it.
...But, I agree on this point."

Letty adopted a stance with her right foot and right hand forward,
standing diagonally to her opponent. Dominique also had her right foot
and right hand forward, but her body was turned entirely sideways in a
half-body stance. It was a more defensive posture, minimizing the area
presented to the opponent.

"...I see, you want me to attack?"

"Well, I'm the one who's supposed to be observing, right? Of course,
you'll be checking things out, too."

Dominique was laughing freely, but Letty could see absolutely no
opening. *Does she have that much leeway, or is this simply what they
call composure?*

In any case—

"Understood."

The moment she finished speaking, a dry, sharp sound rang out. The
surrounding spectators stiffened, looking as if they wanted to say,
"Huh?" There stood Letty in a thrusting posture and Dominique, who had
parried it with her wooden sword.

"Hey, hey, isn't it a bit much to come at me with the intention to
kill?"

"I figured you'd be fine. You parried it, after all," Letty muttered, a
hint of frustration in her voice.

A single instant.

In the moment they faced each other, ready to begin.

Without any preliminary motion, Letty had launched a full-speed thrust.
Lightning-fast, completely relaxed, relying on the shift of her center
of gravity from gravity alone, without any tension or strain. Dominique
had easily swept it aside. As if she had anticipated it.

"Well, yeah, I parried it, but if it weren't me, they wouldn't have been
able to!"

Dominique turned her wrist while parrying, pinning Letty's wooden sword.
The feeling of being constrained, controlled. She hated it. Letty pulled
back her blade, along with her entire body, and retreated.

Sensing the abandoned counterattack, Dominique pressed forward, turned
her wrist, and used the strength in her back to unleash a sweeping
horizontal strike, but she fell short by a step.

"Oh, my, how fast you are."

"Well, I can do this much."

Dominique's swing stopped without being fully executed. The wooden
sword, held horizontally, was aimed threateningly at Letty's face, and
the pressure prevented Letty from stepping forward immediately.

Still, it was a practice match, and there was no reason to be cautious.
Letty circled, maintaining distance, moving to her right—the opponent's
left flank—in an arc. Naturally, Dominique tracked her with her wooden
sword and shifted her body.

This circular motion lasted only about a second. Then, Letty abruptly
changed direction, targeting her opponent's right flank—the back of the
half-body-stanced Dominique—and leaped in to strike.

"Nice move. That's youth for you."

The instant Letty changed direction, Dominique had shifted the position
of her right foot. A spin on that foot brought her body to a position
where neither a vertical nor a horizontal swing could reach her.

Seeing that the vertical downward strike was dodged, Letty didn't kill
her momentum, striking the ground instead. Using the rebound, she raised
her practice sword and delivered a horizontal sweep while stepping in.
But Dominique, who had already stabilized her posture, easily
intercepted it.

This time, Letty used the recoil to swing up, feinted a reverse diagonal
slash, and then used the momentum of her twisted body to switch into a
diagonal slash. Even that was read and easily intercepted.

"I already knew it, but you're really fast. This is a struggle even for
me," Dominique said with a composed look.

She was clearly being read. Letty didn't know why, and it was futile to
think about it now.

She pushed against the intercepted wooden sword, putting her weight into
it. The fact that it was easily stopped was something she had already
anticipated. In that instant, she relaxed her strength, allowing her
sword to flow downwards until it scraped the ground, before transforming
the motion into a swing aimed for the legs.

But her target was no longer there. The moment Letty released her
strength, Dominique slid back. As her sword struck the ground, Letty
tried to leverage the recoil to lift it, but it was stamped down upon.

"Right, one point."

A wooden sword was stopped just before Letty's forehead.

"...I lose."

After a momentary flash of frustration, Letty conceded defeat cleanly.

A few seconds later, a loud cheer erupted from the onlookers who had
been watching with bated breath. Among them, Ellie looked on with an
expression of intense disappointment, as if the loss were her own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having grown old, she finally reflects on her life.

Footprints fade with the passage of time.

But once etched into someone's life, they never disappear.

Up Next: Has Life Been Good?

Not bad. With a feeling of certainty.
