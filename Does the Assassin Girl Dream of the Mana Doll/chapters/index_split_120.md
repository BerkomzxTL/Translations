## Chapter 143: To the Ruins

"I see, that is strange indeed..."

Batbayar looked serious after hearing Ellie's report. His voice was
questioning, clearly not satisfied.

"Yes, that tool is used to control highly functional golems and the
like... Is Gaschnar known for its golem manufacturing?"

"No, not at all. That country is, if anything, a magical backwater. They
shouldn't be able to even repair one, let alone manufacture any."

A massive number of golems had been created during the era of the
Ancient Magic Civilization, but most of those techniques were lost with
the collapse of the Karsavina Empire. Since then, some countries have
managed to revive golem-related technology from the few remaining
documents, but only to a limited extent. Furthermore, they could produce
things that, at best, barely moved, and no country had managed to make
anything truly practical or usable. Ellie had heard snippets of this
situation from Letty.

"In that case, it makes even less sense..."

"Well, maybe they've managed to poach a golem researcher, or they've
found some new ancient documents. Still, it's not the kind of technology
that can be figured out overnight... In any case, it looks like this
needs to be investigated."

Batbayar was well-acquainted with the methods of King Gorada of
Gaschnar. While he used the word "poach," Gorada was certainly capable
of, and likely had, used methods bordering on kidnapping to bring
someone over. Just as he was mulling over this, Batbayar suddenly looked
up.

"Wait. Could this be related to the attempts to interfere with Tseren?"

"Eh? ...I can't say there's a direct connection, but there's no evidence
to deny it either."

If they were to abduct Princess Tseren, they would certainly gain
leverage over Cordor. Tseren, who had been listening, didn't show her
alarm on her face but instead clenched her fists tightly. And
Batbayar... a vein was throbbing in his temple.

"If that's the case, I'll crush him, I mean it," Batbayar muttered in a
heavy voice; one that seemed as if to resonate with the depths of hell.

"Hold on, Your Majesty,” Dominique interrupted him with exasperation,
probably on purpose. “What good is a commander who lets his blood run
hot?"

Batbayar, his momentum broken, turned an ill-tempered look towards
Dominique. "No, but sister. If that is the case, I truly cannot overlook
it."

"If your guess is correct, yes. And I'd gladly help out myself; that
would be absolutely infuriating. But for now, it's still just a guess.
First, we solidify the evidence, and then we act," Dominique admonished.

"Hm. That's true, but... no, you're right. Everyone, I apologize, forget
I said that." He was about to retort but cut himself off. Having
reconsidered, Batbayar offered a small bow to those around him in a
calmer voice. The disturbed atmosphere immediately settled down a bit.

"To reaffirm what we should do... Strengthening intelligence gathering
in Gaschnar is a given. We also need to reinforce the security detail
for the royal family, including myself. I must warn the others, too."

He confirmed what needed to be done and immediately sent a messenger to
the two princes. Then, he turned to Dominique.

"Sister, this must be fate. I apologize, but could I ask you to guard
Tseren?"

"Of course. If anything were to happen now, even I wouldn't be able to
sleep well at night. Given the circumstances, I'll give you a discount
based on our acquaintance."

"...With your skill, even a discount is likely to cost a fortune."

Batbayar grimaced as Dominique immediately dove into negotiating with a
straight face. Nevertheless, she was undoubtedly the most reliable
person available at the moment. He decided to hire her, agreeing to her
terms.

"And what about Egret and Ellie..."

"Ah, Your Majesty, could you let those two have some freedom for a
while?"

"Hm? Why is that?"

In his current situation, he needed people he could trust more than
ever, skilled fighters in particular. He couldn’t easily acquiesce.

"First, as long as they are at the royal castle, my presence, plus a few
others, should be sufficient for guarding Princess Tseren. Secondly,
this whole thing started because those two are looking for something. If
they venture into the ruins to search for it, they might run into
Gorada's operatives. If we're lucky, they might even catch one and
extract information. Also, it seems they have pressing business, so I'd
like to prioritize their search."

"Hmm... I see. You're right, over-concentrating our forces and reducing
our reach isn't a good move."

"As expected of Your Majesty, that's exactly it." Dominique nodded
respectfully.

Batbayar waved his hand dismissively. "Stop it, being praised by you,
Big Sis, makes my back itch."

After enjoying their banter, he turned back to Letty and Ellie.

"So, you two are free to do as you please. However, I would appreciate
it if you could lend a hand after your business is finished."

"Yes, understood. We'll do everything we can."

"This is fate, after all. Absolutely."

Batbayar and Tseren smiled with relief at their immediate responses.

"No, you two, you shouldn't be so quick! You should negotiate your pay
properly!"

"Well, we haven't decided what we'll be undertaking yet..."

Dominique tried to act the master even here, only to be rebutted by
Letty with an exasperated look.

\*\*\*

In any case, with their immediate plan decided, Letty and Ellie visited
the ruins early in the morning the next day.

It was part of the former capital of the long-lost Karsavina Empire. Due
to the overdevelopment of magic and the subsequent proliferation of
magic weapons, the main facilities of the capital had been moved
underground for defense. Then, with the sudden collapse of the Empire,
these facilities lost power and ended up buried deep beneath the earth.

Over the long years, the ruins became the dwelling of monsters. Many
adventurers challenged the ruins in search of ancient treasures, and
most perished. The few lucky ones who returned brought back mostly
useless junk that had lost its function, but even that had a demand
among enthusiasts. The small number of actually usable treasures were
considered priceless and snatched up quickly.

And so, adventurers dreaming of quick riches continued to challenge the
labyrinth, only to scatter and perish. The ancient ruins, swallowing the
lives of both the people of the past and the present, simply remain
there, silent.

It was these ruins that Letty and Ellie were now preparing to challenge.

"There are other entrances besides the one everyone uses, you know,"
Ellie murmured proudly in a small forest, far from the main entrance
where adventurers came and went.

Since it was once a city, it was only natural that there were multiple
entrances. However, the prevailing established concepts of "ancient
ruins" and "labyrinth" were so strong that no one thought to search for
other entrances. No one considered the possibility of a shortcut.

"I think that's understandable. Though, I guess I can also say 'As
expected of Ellie'."

"Oh, Letty-san, you're so sweet! Say more, please, say more!"

"Eh... If you put it that way, it's kind of hard to say..."

"Aww, why not!"

Without any sign of apprehension, the two continued to walk leisurely.
Although Ellie had never been there in person, she had a map of the
former Karsavina capital in her memory. She also had a general idea of
the location of the department that would likely house the information
circuit parts they were looking for. The entrance they needed to use,
determined by cross-referencing this information, had been confirmed
during their prior scouting trip.

"...Yes, this entrance is definitely operational."

Ellie sounded satisfied as she checked the entrance door. Letty, looking
over her shoulder, didn't understand what she was seeing, but if Ellie
said so, it must be true.

Indeed, when Ellie operated something beside the door... a *pssht*
sound, like air escaping, accompanied the door sliding open.

"...As expected."

"Ehehe, isn't it?"

"...As expected of my wife."

"Hwah!?"

Ellie's proud smile instantly froze, and Letty chuckled softly.

"Come on, shall we go?"

She pressed a light kiss on Ellie's cheek before stepping through the
doorway.

"Ah, w-wait for me! Oh, Letty-san, you idiotttttt!!"

Flustered, Ellie hurried after her while shouting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A one-way ticket leading to the deep abyss.

A darkness that deepens with every step.

The reason they can walk this path, which would crush any single person,
must be...

Up Next: Road to the Depths

The footsteps of the two are engraved, quietly and surely.
