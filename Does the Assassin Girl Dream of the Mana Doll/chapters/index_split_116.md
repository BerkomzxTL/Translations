## Chapter 139: Sign of Blooming

After breakfast, they were somehow detained for one reason or another
and ended up staying for lunch before finally leaving the castle in the
early afternoon. Incidentally, at Tseren's request, they borrowed the
courtyard for a light training session between breakfast and lunch.
Batbayar was full of praise upon observing, while the castle soldiers
were left speechless. In any case, it was decided that they would rest
that afternoon and resume training the following day.

And then, the next morning.

"Egret. What happened to Ellie today?" Dominique questioned her.

"Ah, well..." Letty was unusually hesitant, averting her eyes. After
stumbling over her words for a moment, she opened her mouth tentatively.
"She, um, said her back hurt too much to get up..."

Dominique fell silent. After a pause, she let out a sigh of
exasperation.

"Egret, it's not my place to interfere in your affairs, and I understand
you're excited since things just got serious. But learn to have a little
more self-control."

"Yeah, I'm reflecting... I really need to hold back a bit... But I think
Ellie is also at fault."

As Letty was about to argue back, Dominique raised her hand to cut her
off. "Hold it right there, not another word. I refuse to listen to a
long, drawn-out explanation that could be an excuse, a complaint, or a
boast."

Letty's words halted as she seemed to swallow something, and she gave
Dominique a slightly resentful look, but Dominique paid no mind.

"Come on, forget about that. Let's focus on today's training. We've
managed to set aside the time, so let's polish things up for the
tournament." Dominique immediately picked up her wooden sword.

Letty, taking her own, spoke apologetically. "Ah, about that... sorry, I
might have to go to the ancient ruins for a few days soon."

"Oh? Ah, is that the 'other purpose' you mentioned earlier? Well, if
that's the case, it can't be helped... Just a few days, though?"
Dominique nodded in understanding but then voiced her doubt. After all,
the ancient ruins in Cordor were enormous in scale. It was rumored that
fully exploring them would take a month. She wondered what could
possibly be accomplished in just a few days.

"Yeah, well, it seems we won't need to go too deep," Letty mumbled while
averting her eyes.

In fact, Ellie had said so yesterday when they went to scope out the
exterior of the ruins in the afternoon. *“I think we can use the back
entrance,”* she had said. Though since Letty couldn't very well talk
about that, she just clumsily evaded the question.

Dominique skillfully raised one eyebrow as if to suggest something, but
she didn't press further and just nodded. "Well, if that's the case, it
shouldn't significantly impact the tournament, so I don't mind. Ah, but
come back without any injuries, okay?"

"Yes, thank you. I’ll be careful. ...Although, I'm more worried about
not getting injured during *this* training."

"Ha! Don't worry. I'll make sure to hold back properly."

"...That, too, makes me feel a bit complicated, but..."

She spoke, yet raised her wooden sword into a stance. They began with
their usual sparring practice. Her movements, to which she had become
completely accustomed, flowed smoothly and without hesitation, their
swords crossing and separating, then crossing again. Compared to when
they first started training, she could maintain the exchange for much
longer.

\*\*\*

"...I yield," Letty called out her surrender as Dominique tapped her on
the shoulder.

Dominique wore a delighted grin. "Honestly, I'm happy you're such a
quick learner. At this rate, it looks like we can move on to the next
stage."

"The next stage? Are you going to teach me something else?"

Letty studied Dominique's face. A flash of surprise appeared and
vanished in her expression. Despite not being overly expressive, a clear
sense of anticipation and excitement was evident on her face. Letty
realized she, too, was unconsciously smiling.

"Yes, it looks like you're ready, too."

"Ready? ...Eh, I don't know what you mean..."

Letty tilted her head in confusion and looked at Dominique. She was
aware that she had grown accustomed to the sparring and that her
movements had become more refined, but she had no idea how that
connected to the next step.

"Well, I hadn't told you, had I? But because you've worked on it so
diligently without knowing, it's been nicely refined." Dominique nodded
to herself with satisfaction.

Troubled, Letty spoke up, "No, um... instead of nodding to yourself,
could you please tell me what you mean?"

"Ah," Dominique replied casually. "My bad, my bad. Let's see, where
should I start... Egret, where do you think the most power is generated
in the human body?"

"Uh... I would think the legs."

"Ah, correct. Now, where specifically in the legs?"

"Specifically... I'd guess the thighs."

"That's what most people think, right? But apparently, that's not quite
right. Though I'm just parroting a scholar. It seems the most power is
generated around the hip joint." *Pat, pat*, Dominique patted her own
hip.

Letty blinked rapidly. She instinctively glanced down at her own hips,
thought for a moment, then looked up. "That's very hard to believe."

"I know, right? I thought so too at first. The thighs generate about
three to four times body weight, but the scholar explained meticulously,
with formulas and everything, that the hip joint generates over five
times that when walking. I also tried it out myself, was convinced by
the logic, and applied it to various techniques. If you injure one leg,
you use a cane and your arm strength to support your body, but walking
still becomes incredibly difficult, right? That can also be explained by
this logic."

"...I see, people do seem to have trouble walking... I understand that."

Letty, who hadn't been shown the mathematical formulas, couldn't grasp
the logic, but the experiential example made her a little more
convinced.

"I wish I could have shown you the formulas. You don't seem to have
trouble understanding logic. But, well, since that's impossible, for
now, just trust me."

"Understood. I'll trust you for now."

Dominique nodded to the agreement and took a step back.

"Now, even if you want to use the power around the hip joint
effectively, people don't consciously use or move that area when walking
or running, and it lacks flexibility. So, first, you need to gain the
awareness and flexibility to move that area."

"...Wait, was that special footwork just preparation for that?"

Dominique clapped lightly in response to Letty's sudden realization.

"A keen observation. And you, by diligently practicing it, have
unknowingly completed all the prep work."

"I did notice my sword seemed strangely light and easy to move during
the last fight... So that was the setup all along..."

"The fact that you could already use it a little before being taught
shows how much you've worked at it. And now, the plan is to polish that
and make it usable. How about that? Aren't you excited?"

Dominique gave a delighted, knowing smirk.

Letty nodded, slightly grudgingly, yet unable to hide it.

"Yeah, I guess so."

In contrast to her lukewarm words, her eyes were shining.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A hidden power conveyed through ingrained technique.

The blade that runs with a growl feels like it belongs to someone else.

Yet, the sensation is definitely her own.

Up Next: Howl, Sword

As if the world has opened up before her.
