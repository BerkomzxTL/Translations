## Chapter 149: Light in the Labyrinth

"Ellie, calm down. You're going too fast."

"Ah, yes, I'm sorry, Letty-san."

This was one of many exchanges since they resumed their search. Letty
chided Ellie as she rushed ahead with an urgent look. This had been
happening repeatedly.

Neither Ellie's enhanced senses nor Letty's detection magic had picked
up any enemies. Still, they needed to proceed cautiously, with no
certainty about what could lay ahead. Ellie knew this. She *should* know
this. Yet, her behavior had been strange since the search resumed.

"Ellie, wait a moment. Let's rest for a bit."

"Eh, ah, yes... I'm sorry."

As Ellie stopped, she saw Letty’s clock was about to strike the ninth
hour. It had been about three hours since they entered the Research
Facility. They should have eaten dinner and prepared for sleep long ago.
At the very least, Letty should rest properly, even if Ellie, being a
Mana Doll, didn't strictly need to. Although, Letty herself showed no
signs of fatigue whatsoever.

"You've been acting a little strange. I'd like you to explain what's
going on if something happened."

"Aww, I'm sorry... I've just been feeling incredibly rushed..."

They settled down in a small, uninhabited room, sitting side by side, as
Letty questioned her. Ellie seemed to be aware of her own hastiness and
shrank with an apologetic expression.

"I'm not angry, but I do want you to tell me what happened. Both for the
sake of continuing the search, and simply as... your lover."

"Letty-san... Stop, oh my, what are you saying in a place like this?"

Even after all the things they had done, being addressed so directly
still made her blush. They both had flushed cheeks and fidgeted with
embarrassment for a while. Once she calmed down a little, Ellie spoke.

"Um... First, do you remember when I couldn't use Mana Bolt anymore?"

"Huh, of course I do."

That was after the commotion in Valandia had settled. She still
remembered the various tests they had done in the forest near Azar a few
months ago.

"At that time, I mentioned that the Blaster output was too high, right?
And then, even during our journey to Cordor, the output seemed to be
going crazy."

"Yes, I remember that too, of course. I've been watching it closely."

The power she saw in the first ruins they met was incredible, but the
Blaster's power had become particularly extraordinary recently. The
light was blinding, and the power seemed to sweep everything away. Only
Letty knew that this was still a slightly suppressed version.

"Well, now I can clearly tell exactly how much the power has increased."

"...I see? But that's not a bad thing, is it? Isn’t it actually good?"

"Yes, it *is* good, but..."

Ellie cut herself off and looked up at the ceiling. Her gaze was
distant, as if looking beyond the ceiling itself.

"...It's 400%."

"...What? What is 400%?"

From the flow of the conversation, it wasn't that she didn't know what
the subject was. But she couldn't believe it. There was no way to
believe it.

"The output correction. By the way, it's 400% when I'm touching you,
Letty-san, and 300% when I'm not."

"What kind of crazy correction is that... 4 times or 3 times… that's
absurd..."

Ellie shook her head in response to Letty's astonished tone.

"It's *plus*. +400% and +300%."

"...Um... does that mean... 5 times and 4 times...?"

Ellie just nodded silently. A silence so profound it was almost audible.
The power of the Blaster, which could fell an iron golem with one blow.
It was now 5 times that. It might be enough to take down even a dragon
in a single hit.

"Yes, it seems so... My own senses, and the feeling compared to before,
roughly match, so I think it's correct."

"Why is this happening?"

"I don't know, that's the thing. And what makes even less sense is that
the display right after the procedure was +250%."

"...Huh? Why is there a 50% difference?"

"I don't know that either... why the sudden change?"

Ellie let out a tired sigh. Letty, too, put a hand to her chin and
pondered.

"The increase in power itself is something to be happy about, right?"

"Of course it is, but..."

"But it's scary and unsettling when the power increases for no known
reason..."

"Exactly, that's it... I get worried, wondering, 'What's happening to
me?'"

Letty stroked Ellie's head, who had lowered her face in distress. She
didn't know how else to comfort her.

"But I do have one clue... during the replacement procedure, I had a
dream. I saw two people who seemed to be Mana Doll researchers
discussing something... probably related to output enhancement. So I
thought, maybe there's a clue somewhere here."

"I see... that's a possibility. But, Ellie. I understand your
impatience, but I want you to talk to me about things like this
properly. That way, I can think things through and adjust our plans."

"Ugh, I'm sorry..."

Letty hugged the dejected Ellie and continued stroking her head. Ellie
was always bright and positive, but she couldn't be like that all the
time. And when she felt anxious, she probably didn't know what to do.
Letty thought so, too.

"I'm a little dissatisfied, though."

"Ugh, I'm sorry..."

"Ah, well... it's probably not what you're thinking. I'm dissatisfied
with myself for not being someone you felt you could consult when you
were this anxious."

If she had been better, Ellie wouldn't have been so anxious. Thinking
that, she felt rather inadequate. Ellie looked stunned by the unexpected
reply.

"Why do you turn it around like that… I'm the one who got anxious on my
own. It's my fault."

"Maybe it's because I don't want to think of it that way... I want to
take responsibility for everything that happens to the two of us
together."

When Letty whispered that, Ellie's body gave a little start. After a
tense moment, she relaxed and leaned against Letty.

"That's why... That's the kind of thing you do... Letty-san, you're too
lenient with me."

"Well, I'm aware of that... But it's fine if it's just for you, Ellie."

"I hate that I can't say no to you..."

Ultimately, she could afford to complain because she believed she would
be accepted like this. She disliked that part of herself a little, but
she didn't dislike being accepted. And she loved the person who accepted
her.

Ellie sighed, as if giving up, yet looking slightly satisfied in the
embrace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They say the night drives people mad.

Or that it opens doors that remain closed in the daylight.

A night in the ruins, an extraordinary night. Stirring various emotions.

Up Next: An Atypical Night

Or perhaps there was nothing typical in the first place.
