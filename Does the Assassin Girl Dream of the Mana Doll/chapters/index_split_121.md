## Chapter 144: Road to the Depths

*Clack, clack,* a hard, metallic sound resonated.

"Ellie, no enemy reactions up to that corner."

"Yes, understood."

With sure steps, and exchanging words occasionally, the two made their
way cautiously through the ruins, with Ellie leading while holding a
magical light. Powered by her virtually inexhaustible magical power, the
tool brightly illuminated the surroundings. Ellie claimed she was
deliberately suppressing it, as too much brightness could attract
monsters. Still, to Letty, it still seemed almost too bright.

"The monsters haven't been much of a bother so far," Letty observed.

"Yes, I think the highest density of mana is probably closer to the city
center, so they're likely staying there," Ellie added while vigilantly
scanning the area.

In truth, this area was relatively on the outer edge of the capital. It
was far from the entrance currently used by adventurers and seemed to
have fewer factors attracting monsters for various reasons.

"If this keeps up, we might arrive sooner than expected."

"That would be fortunate. If we can reach the Research Facility, we
might be able to lock down the rooms."

It had only been about an hour since they entered the ruins. They had
encountered very few enemies and things were progressing extremely
smoothly. At this pace, they seemed likely to infiltrate the Research
Facility by late afternoon.

The facility in question could be called the heart of the research and
development of Mana Dolls, like Ellie herself. It was a place where
various mages conducted round-the-clock research, creating new magic,
magical tools, and magic weapons.

At the time, several such facilities had been scattered throughout the
capital, and the one they were heading for now was believed to be the
headquarters. Ellie had said that the exact location was uncertain since
she had never been there in person.

Incidentally, the Wiskeraf in Valandia where Ellie was created was said
to be a kind of branch office. The information processing circuit they
were looking for was similar to components used in large-scale magical
tool research, so the chances of coming up empty were low, though not
zero.

"Reaching it that quickly would be a great help... We'd secure a safe
place to sleep."

Even if they successfully obtained the part at the first research
facility they reached, returning would take time. While they could
technically *Leap* as a last resort, Letty wanted to avoid doing it in
Cordor, where they were unfamiliar with the geography. And even though
they took turns keeping watch, there was a significant difference
between resting inside a building compared to resting outdoors, so
whether they could use the Research Facility was crucial.

"Yes, for a safe return. But I expect there will be golems.'"

Naturally, such an important facility would have guards. Even though
1,500 years had passed since the city ceased to function, golems were
reportedly still operational.

"Since I can't counter them yet, I'll have to rely on you, Ellie."

"Yes, leave it to me! ...Though, Letty-san, hasn't the power of your
sword clearly increased?"

"Hmm... the training is starting to show results, perhaps."

Letty replied sounding slightly pleased while vigilantly surveying the
surroundings. So far, they had encountered goblins and orcs a few times,
and she had managed to successfully decapitate them with a single
strike, provided they weren't surrounded and could stop to attack.
Considering that she used to only be able to slice through soft parts,
her progress in terms of power was remarkable.

"Do results usually appear that quickly? It's only been about two days
since we came to the capital."

"Ah, actually..."

Letty then told Ellie the meaning behind the training she had been doing
since meeting Dominique. Ellie's eyes widened halfway through the
explanation.

"...Just who is Dominique-san, anyway?"

"I wonder... The more I know, the less I understand..."

They exchanged glances and spoke with troubled expressions. Yes, they
still couldn't grasp who she was. While one could attribute it to a
difference in life experience, they both felt there was much more to it
than that.

"Well... maybe there's no point in thinking about it. She'll just dodge
it unless she feels like telling us."

"That's certainly true."

They exchanged wry smiles. There was definitely a sense of, *‘It's
Dominique, so it can't be helped.’*

Such conversations continued for a while longer.

\*\*\*

"Ellie, probably two golems approaching from the front."

"Yes, understood."

As soon as an enemy approached, their expressions changed. Mana
immediately began to gather in Ellie's hands.

And the moment two golems emerged from the darkness—

"Mana Blaster!!!"

The mana unleashed with her command surged towards the golems as a
torrent of light. It was like a great serpent biting its prey. It
latched on and crushed them with a heavy, dull thud.

The intense light, which had coated the entire corridor, subsided after
a few seconds, and silence and darkness soon returned to the ruins.

"Enemy confirmed destroyed. ...You're amazing, Ellie." Letty praised her
for easily defeating the golems.

To which Ellie returned a shy smile. "Ehehe, thank you ♪"

Letty restrained her urge to praise her more, in consideration of where
they currently were, settling for just a light pat on the head. Ellie
still gave a beaming smile, which almost made Letty lose her composure.

"These are also iron golems... No problem for you, but..."

"Yes, no problem. But is something wrong?"

"No, not exactly wrong, but..."

She looked closely at the golems. More accurately, at the area around
and behind them.

"I'm worried about the impact on the surroundings in such a narrow
space."

"...Ah. I, see..."

The floor and walls around and behind the golems were severely cracked.
Ellie’s Mana Blaster, which unleashes overflowing magical power, didn’t
only affect the target, unlike her Mana Bolt. Inevitably, damage to
surrounding structures was unavoidable. For now, the walls and building
hadn't collapsed, but... The ruins where Letty met Ellie were military
facilities, so the corridors were wide and sturdy, and it hadn't been a
concern then. It seemed this area was different.

"But if I reduce the power too much, I won't be able to defeat them."

"That's right... And the golems are definitely harder than the walls."

Letty lightly tapped the golem and the wall to check the sensation.
Although the magical reinforcement was starting to wear off, the golem's
body still felt harder than normal iron. *To destroy this
effectively...* Letty, deep in thought, suddenly looked up.

"Hey, Ellie. Can you narrow the blaster?"

"Narrow it? Not reduce the power?"

"Yes, that's right. Um... like, converge it? Instead of just letting it
burst out, you squeeze it together when you release it."

"Ah, I understand what you mean. I hadn't thought of that... I'll try it
next time."

When Ellie was serving in the army, she was mostly on open battlefields,
and the Mana Blaster was often used at relatively close range. She
didn't have the time or the need to reduce or adjust the power. Now that
Letty mentioned it, converging the blast would lessen the impact on the
surroundings. It should also improve energy efficiency.

That was all she intended. Until she tried it on the next golem.

"Mana Blaster!"

The converged light pierced the darkness, struck the golem, and shot
right through it. Instead of the usual crashing sound, there was a
*sizzle*, like something evaporating. A strange metallic smell hung in
the air, and the golem, with part of its upper body completely vaporized
and emitting a steam-like substance, was destroyed.

"...Huh?"

Ellie froze, her hand still thrust out towards the golem. She blinked
several times, unable to believe what she had just done.

"I thought the power would increase, but not by this much," Letty
murmured with admiration from behind.

If imagining the Mana Blaster as a cylinder, when the radius was halved,
the area of the circular base became one-quarter. In that case, the
energy density per same area ended up quadrupled.

This time, Ellie had converged the blast to one-third the radius. In
that case, the energy density was nine times higher. And this was the
result.

"Letty-san."

"Yes?"

"Did I... waste a lot of power until now?"

"...Let's just say you've learned a more efficient way to use it."

Letty replied, stroking Ellie's head several times to calm the
still-stunned mage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thousand five hundred years—a time far too long for humans.

Sometimes, human creations decay even faster.

Turning a blind eye to time's irony, people seek only its benefits.

Up Next: What’s Left Behind

It is for the present, or perhaps for the future.
