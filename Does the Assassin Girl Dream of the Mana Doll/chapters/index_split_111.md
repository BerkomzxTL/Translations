## Chapter 134: Wisteria-Colored Melancholy

Five bells rang immediately after the audience ended. The winter sun had
already begun to sink far over the plains, staining the earth red. The
banquet was prepared and began at an hour that could be called slightly
early for dinner, just as the chill of the night began to creep in.

"...I feel like the preparations were finished quite quickly."

"Fufu, Father has been giving various instructions since yesterday
because he wanted to host a gathering for all of you."

"He intended to do this from the start... Dominique's comment was just a
good excuse, then."

Letty glanced toward the head of the table. Batbayar and Dominique were
happily downing their drinks. She had already lost count of how many
glasses they had emptied.

Swallowing a sigh of exasperation, she tilted her own glass. The
alcohol, made from mare's milk, was low in proof, sour, and refreshing.
It seemed to pair well with the rather rich seasoning of the local
cuisine, clearing the palate nicely.

"It makes sense that he suggested it so eagerly, as if he'd been waiting
for it\\" Ellie chimed in, her voice slightly drawling more than usual.

She was still clinging to Letty's arm.

"Yeah, you're right... Wait, Ellie, are you already drunk...?"

"Ehhh? I'm not drunk at all\\"

*That's a lie.* But such a thought was swallowed.

She could feel the soft, flushed warmth on the arm being clung to. The
moist, languid look in the eyes staring up at her. She was clearly
drunk. She was, but...

She hesitated to point it out and potentially ruin the moment.

"The drink you had... isn’t it a strong one...?"

"Not at all\\ Oh, would you like a taste, Letty-san?"

From an intimate distance, she was offered a glass with a mischievous,
upward glance. Reluctantly accepting it, Letty could smell the alcohol
just by bringing it near her mouth. It was likely arkhi¹—mare's milk
alcohol that had been distilled to strengthen the proof. Tasting it, the
flavor was strong, as expected. It was perhaps slightly milder than
Jurastin's distilled liquor, but still potent.

"It is a strong one."

"No way\\ You're drinking it just fine, Letty-san\\"

"That's because I was trained for it." Replying with a troubled look,
she hesitated whether to return the glass. She glanced at her own, lost
thought for a moment. "Say, Ellie. This meat is delicious when eaten
with this drink."

"Is that so? Then I'll have a bit." Ellie immediately straightened up,
ate the meat, and took a sip of the weaker mare's milk liquor. *I see, I
see*, she nodded, before taking another sip.

*Thank goodness there was meat,* Letty thought while taking a sip of the
distilled drink. She gazed off into the distance, increasingly
questioning her own recent manipulative tactics.

Just then, Tseren, who had been watching, spoke up:

"Um, Egret-sama. Can one really build a tolerance to alcohol through
training?"

"Ah... It's more accurate to say that it’s possible for *some* people to
build a tolerance. You can get used to the taste to some extent through
training, but... even then, some people simply can't handle it."

Letty had indeed been able to acclimate to alcohol, as part of her
anti-poison training. Some people boasted of gaining a tolerance to
alcohol in a similar way, but that was likely a survivor bias. This was
not a world kind enough to lend help to those who lost themselves to
drinking; they would simply fade away. Letty was aware that she was just
lucky her constitution was compatible.

"I see... I was hoping I could become more tolerant with training."

"...What I went through was actual training. Starting with weak drinks
and gradually increasing the strength... I don't think it's what you
imagine."

"I, I see... Hmm... I feel like I've been shown the gap between
aspiration and reality..."

Tseren looked back and forth between Letty's face and the glass in her
hand with a complex expression. After watching her for a few moments,
Letty shook her head slightly.

"Did I disillusion you?"

"No, not at all. ...Ah, perhaps I'm disillusioned with myself. I've seen
Egret-sama and Dominique-sama work up close, but maybe I was only seeing
the cool parts."

Letty stared at the wryly smiling Tseren for a few seconds. Then, she
shook her head gently.

"That's understandable. Especially Dominique. I think she believes it's
cool not to show things like that."

In many ways, Dominique seemed like someone who gave the illusion of
carelessness but never showed a true weakness. Letty intuitively
understood that this was surely underpinned by a genuine confidence in
her accumulated skill and talent.

Even now. While she was happily drinking with Batbayar, she maintained a
balance that would allow her to instantly stand and act at any moment.
Letty, too, could naturally adopt a ready posture, but she wondered if
she could do so while drinking so merrily.

Next to Letty, who was lost in rambling thoughts, Tseren maintained her
serious expression.

"Perhaps, in order to truly appreciate what you two have built up, I
really should receive proper training..."

"...You don't see it as a world too far removed from your own, do you?"

Letty asked, looking surprised at the earnestness of Tseren's voice.
Tseren nodded in reply.

"Meeting all of you, being saved, and talking with you has made me
realize something. I was free to ride across the plains, but I lacked
everything necessary to survive there. As a member of the royal family,
especially for the people of the plains, the strength to live on one's
own is essential."

She now believed that her coming-of-age ritual was likely intended to
make her realize that. The misfortune of being attacked during it was
simultaneously invaluable. Now that she had survived. The thought of
what might have been made her naturally straighten her back.

"I don't have a talent for magic like Ellie-sama. That's why I might be
drawn to the skills that Egret-sama and Dominique-sama have acquired."

Tseren smiled as she spoke, her expression looking slightly more mature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Small talk blossoms at the drinking table.

The casual conversation continues tirelessly, fading in and out.

And then, the day's biggest bombshell is thrown.

Up Next: The Banquet is in Full Swing

And words that pierce the heart.

TN:

¹Arkhi is a liquor similar to vodka(?) in Mongolia that’s often reserved
for esteemed guests.

If you haven’t noticed, kingdoms like Valandia and Jurastin are more
Germanic with nouns/spellings. Going further south, it seems to be
eastern, specifically Mongolian, with the nomadic nature, spelling of
names like Tseren, Batbayar, etc. so it’s not really coming out of
nowhere.
