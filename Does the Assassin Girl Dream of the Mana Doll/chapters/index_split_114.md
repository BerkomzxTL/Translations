## Chapter 137: A New Beginning

And so, a feverish night passed.

A night so happy she wondered if it was a dream.

A night spent drowning in heat, marked and etched, the traces left on
their bodies confirming its reality.

Above all, the happy sleeping face of Ellie, resting in her arms now,
assured her that it had not been a dream. The soft texture of the
blanket, and the softer, warmer skin touching her own—both completely
unclothed. She felt that if happiness had a tangible texture, it would
surely feel like this.

*Yes, this must be happiness.*

The softness of the skin they shared, its warmth, which she even found
sweet. The beloved scent that permeated her lungs with every breath. The
peaceful, ear-tickling sound of her sleeping breath. The sleeping face
that showed such happy contentment. The remnants of last night were
recalled as she lightly pecked her cheek. She was feeling every part of
Ellie with all five senses. And it filled her beyond measure.

"...Is it alright for me to be this happy?"

She found herself whispering such a thought.

It was at that moment. Even though she was surely still asleep and
couldn't possibly have heard her. Ellie squeezed her tightly. It was
likely a coincidence, but even so, she felt fulfilled by being needed
like this, even in sleep.

"I received so much from you again, Ellie... What am I going to do?"

Last night, she had been more selfish and greedy than ever before. Ellie
had accepted and offered everything. This made Letty feel impossibly
apologetic, and at the same time impossibly happy. Although she did
wonder about herself, having so ravenously consumed what was offered.

She had vaguely sensed this side of herself for some time. And she had
also sensed this side of Ellie. But the reality had far surpassed those
slight impressions. She was astonished and disillusioned with herself,
yet her gratitude and affection for Ellie, the one who had accepted her,
only grew.

"I hope I was able to give something back, even a little..."

Last night, Ellie had looked truly happy. If that wasn't just her own
vanity. She was genuinely happy that she could make Ellie look like
that, even being the person she was.

She looked at her hands. Hands that had done things that were far from
commendable. But even these hands could do something. They had
accomplished something. Though she still couldn't take pride in it.

She looked back at Ellie. She, too, had originally done things that
couldn’t be praised. But.. *So what?* Ellie was Ellie. Her essence and
what she was forced to do were surely separate things. ...Though that
might be a biased view.

Last night, she was incredibly beautiful. And now, in her arms,
illuminated by the morning sun, she was still incredibly beautiful.
Beautiful enough to make her wish time would just stop.

"But morning always comes..."

Her sharp hearing picked up the sounds of morning starting all around
the castle. Soon, a maid or someone would surely come to wake them. It
felt like such a waste. She wanted to let Ellie remain as she was,
sleeping so blissfully. But unfortunately, she also knew that wasn't
possible.

If it had to be broken, then she would do it herself.

"Hey, Ellie, wake up. It's morning now."

"Mh, mmh... Fiine..."

A sweet, sleepy voice. Just that alone gave her a tightening, yet
warming, sensation in her chest. The thought that she was the only one
who could see Ellie like this even gave rise to a sense of superiority.

"Come on, wake up... We need to get up soon."

"I knowww..."

Slightly petulant. But even that was cute. When Ellie wriggled, it was
ticklish and evoked another kind of sensation. *No, no, we can't,* she
scolded herself while shaking Ellie's shoulder again.

"Come on... if you don't wake up, you won't get to eat breakfast!"

"Ah\\... that is... mmh... hah..."

Ellie finally opened her eyes. Looking at each other from close range,
Ellie's face softened into a happy, relieved smile. Letty realized she
too was smiling, and her cheeks flushed slightly.

"Good morning, Ellie."

"Yes\\ Good morning, Letty-san."

They exchanged warm words. And, *chuu*, closing her eyes, a light,
pecking kiss. The usual.

Perhaps that woke her up a little, as a question mark appeared in
Ellie's eyes. She glanced towards Letty's chest area. A beat later,
having recalled various things, she turned bright red.

"Le-Letty-san! You're not dressed... I, I also..."

"It can't be helped, we fell asleep right after," Letty said, pulling
her close again.

Chest against chest, legs intertwined... as if reenacting the playful
moments of last night. The temperature under the blanket seemed to rise
quickly. It was probably not her imagination.

"N-no, Letty-san, someone will come!"

"Yes, so I'll be quick..."

"Eh, ah, wait, no, Letty-san!"

Ellie offered only verbal resistance, but she couldn't possibly defy her
beloved Master, and she was swept away. True to Letty's declaration, it
was over just before the maid came to wake them.

\*\*\*

As they entered the dining hall for breakfast—

Batbayar looked intently at the two of them and suddenly muttered,
"...What, you hadn't done it yet?"

"See? I told you so. Well then." Dominique, seated across from him, held
out her right hand with a triumphant look. Batbayar placed a gold coin
in it with a regretful expression.

Letty, sensing what had happened, narrowed her eyes. "Your Majesty.
Dominique. ...Using us as material for a bet is not commendable."

In an instant, a killing intent so strong erupted that not only Batbayar
but even Dominique flinched, and the previously festive dining hall
cooled to an absolute zero.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just as one cannot live on bread alone, they cannot live by honeymoon
bliss forever.

For certain sustenance, not just mist. For the goal she strives for.

For the one she wishes to be beside, they begin to walk again.

Up Next: Next Steps

The blade burning with determination is heavy.
