## Chapter 119: An Unsettling Wind

"Well, I know it's rich coming from me since I was the one who egged you
on, but could you two *try* to be a little more reserved?"

Dominique spoke with exasperation to the two who had, unusually, rushed
in just as the assembly time was up. Predictably, both Ellie and Letty
looked awkward. Even more uncomfortable were the escorts, who averted
their eyes.

It was understandable that their faces were flushed since they'd rushed
in. But their strangely moist eyes, and the difference in their
expressions and aura compared to the day before, fueled the guards'
imaginations.

*What exactly happened last night? …Surely not.*

However, no one there was reckless enough to voice such a thought. If
anyone could ask, it would only be Dominique, but she didn't seem
inclined to press the matter further.

"I apologize, I'll restrain myself from now on..." "I'm sorry, I'll be
more careful..."

Was it just their imagination, or did the timing of their synchronized
bows seem oddly perfect? The guards could only take an occasional glance
at them from the side.

"Well, I understand the feeling. Still, the situation out here isn't
exactly peaceful, so try to keep your giddy feelings in check."

"Work is work, I'll be strictly mindful of that."

"Yes, I'll properly separate personal and professional matters..."

Since this was the first time, the rebuke from Dominique, who had
somehow wound up as the de facto leader, seemed to end there.
Instructions were given for everyone to take their posts, and Letty and
Ellie headed for their horses.

"...For now, let's keep the kisses to once a night and once first thing
in the morning until this job is done," Letty whispered as they walked,
only loud enough for Ellie to hear.

Hearing that, Ellie's face turned desperate. That meant she would have
to restrain herself for at least another week until they reached the
royal capital of Cordor. And even longer if including their planned
ruins exploration.

"That's so cruel..."

She understood it was necessary, but she still pleaded with her eyes.
Pressured with such a supplicating look, Letty hesitated.

"...No."

She doubled down, despite looking troubled.

"W-w-whyyy..."

Seeing Ellie slump in disappointment, Letty felt a mix of apology and...
something close to amusement. She didn't know what it was, but she felt
like she shouldn't provoke her further, so she suppressed it.

"It can’t be helped, work comes first... Come on, be a good girl and
let's work hard, okay?"

"Ugh... Okay, I'll try."

Even though she was pouting, getting a little pat on the head from Letty
seemed to cheer her up a bit.

*Is it okay for her to be this easy to handle?* Letty wondered with a
slightly misplaced concern.

\*\*\*

Despite the minor incident at assembly, the caravan set off again
without trouble. The journey after that was uneventful for a while. The
only thing of note was that Letty continued to be trained by Dominique
every day until she was utterly mentally drained.

After three days, Letty's footwork had become much more refined, and she
had begun practicing their unique sparring with the footwork
incorporated. Naturally, her fatigue only increased, but since she
couldn't afford to fall asleep on horseback, she had to stay intensely
focused.

Although Dominique was subtly adjusting the intensity.

By the way, Ellie's impression of the sparring was: "Are you two human?
Surely you’re human, aren’t you?"

Dominique, of course, and even Letty, who was slowly catching up, were
constantly moving without stopping or stagnating. Perhaps that reaction
was only natural.

In any case, with the exception of Letty's mental exhaustion, everything
was fine. They were only about two days away from the royal capital. It
was then that Ellie, who was scanning the surroundings, suddenly called
out a warning:

"Dominique-san, a large group of horses is heading towards us from the
front left! The count is about 30! ...Huh? Something's strange... It
looks like they're chasing a person on a horse?"

"What did you say? ...Egret, circle to the left, take a look! The rest
of you, keep a lookout on the right!"

"Understood."

Letty spurred her horse between the carriages, which had begun to slow
down after Ellie's warning, and circled to the left.

After a moment of looking at the approaching group—

"One woman on a horse. She's waving her hand toward us. Her clothes look
expensive, and it seems like she's asking for help while being pursued
by the group behind her."

"Hmm... Looks like helping her could be good for business. What do you
think, Boss?"

Dominique raised the corner of her lips, calculating the profit, and
called out to the merchant leader as he was about to take cover in his
carriage. He stopped, looking thoughtful for a moment.

"You said the clothes look expensive, right? And she's on a horse... I
might know who that is. I think it would be wise to help her."

Dominique clapped her hands lightly at the merchant's reply.

"Alright, that settles it. We're helping that young lady. Ellie, once
they're in range, use a wide attack, making sure not to hit the one
who's running! Egret, dismount; I have a bad feeling about this."

"Yes, understood!"

"Got it."

With that, the two dismounted and began to prepare. The fleeing woman
was now close enough for them to discern her expression. The face of a
girl, young enough to be called a maiden, was etched with desperation.

"You there! No matter what, don't stop! Come straight towards us!"

It seemed Dominique's call had been heard, as the girl appeared to nod.
Soon, her horse was within range. The pursuers appeared shortly after.

"Mana Blaster."

A flash of light shot out. The attack, aimed carefully to avoid hitting
the girl and her horse, still wiped out nearly half of the pursuing
group. Normally, that would cause them to lose the will to fight, but...

"...Tch, they're still coming towards us, and they've scattered their
formation," Dominique muttered bitterly.

They still outnumbered the caravan. A chaotic fight would likely result
in some casualties.

"Egret, you and I will intercept them. Ellie and all other projectile
users, fire at anyone who breaks through, use your own judgment! The
rest of you, stick to the carriages and defend them!"

Hearing the acknowledgments to her instructions, Dominique moved to
stand side-by-side with Letty.

"Egret, I have one more request for you. ...They may look rough, but I
think they're likely regular soldiers from somewhere, with proper
training. We’ll want to hear what they have to say, so try not to kill
too many of them. Especially anyone who looks like a commander."

"...I see. That's why you want us to go out to them."

The adventurers hired as guards were skilled, but they would likely be
at a disadvantage against properly trained soldiers. Even more so when
the enemy had a numerical advantage.

"That's right. Can you do it?"

"Mm, I'll do my best."

"I'd prefer a more spirited reply, but... well, that's like you, I
suppose. ...Let's go."

With that, the two dashed forward.

They passed the girl's horse, which, as instructed, hadn’t stopped, and
with further acceleration, they drew their swords and charged into the
approaching group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clad in the red of blood, a storm dances.

Relentlessly sweeping aside all who are caught in its path, it does not
stop.

It’s nothing more than the consequence of their own actions.

Up Next: Crimson Rondo

The scent of blood is her perfume.
