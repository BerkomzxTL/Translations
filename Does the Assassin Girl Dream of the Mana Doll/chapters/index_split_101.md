## Chapter 124: Conspiracies, Machinations, Recklessness

"Still, Gaschnar again, huh? It's really escalated beyond just a whiff
of trouble now," Dominique grumbled, crossing her arms, after extracting
all the information and retying the men.

According to their confession, they belonged to the Gaschnar Northern
Army—no, that was a subtle lie they initially tried as a last-ditch
effort, but Letty quickly saw through it. They admitted to being an
intelligence unit of the Central Army. Their objective was the
kidnapping of Princess Tseren.

Letty nodded slightly. "They weren't told the purpose of the kidnapping
itself... but it's certainly not for any good reason."

After all, they had just heard that the tightening of regulations within
Gaschnar had become unusually severe. Coupled with this incident, it
seemed like they could only be aiming for turmoil in Cordor.

"Well, anyone who attempts something as audacious as kidnapping a
country's princess isn't up to any good. And this is coming straight
from the Central Army, not just some rogue action by the Northern Army.
There's even a possibility it's a direct order from the King himself."

"If that's the case, there's a high probability of conflict between
countries being involved. To be honest, getting entangled in that is...
something I would’ve liked to avoid," Letty spoke hesitantly, looking
troubled.

This seemed amusing to Dominique, and she broke into a teasing
mean-spirited grin. "Oh? You *wished* to avoid it, you say?"

"...If I hadn't met her, I would have avoided it. But having met, and
even exchanged greetings, well, it's a bit hard to just walk away..."
She mumbled in a sullen tone.

Hearing her explanation, Dominique's malicious grin deepened with even
more pleasure. "Haha, you have a soft spot after all. I like that, I
really do."

"Yeah, I figured you would..." Letty sighed, with a look of
exasperation. Then, she adopted a pensive expression and turned back to
Dominique. "But seriously, what are we going to do? When it comes to
conflicts between countries, there's only so much we can actually do."

"That's right, there's only so much *we* can do. So, we should ask
someone who can do a lot more." Dominique countered with an air of
complete composure, which only deepened Letty's confusion.

"Someone who can do a lot more, you say…” Frowning so much that wrinkles
formed on her brow, she tilted her head. “It's not impossible to go to
the King, since we saved Princess Tseren, but I doubt they'd trust us
that readily."

"Well, even with Princess Tseren's recommendation, the chances of
immediate trust are fifty-fifty, or maybe a little lower. But the story
changes if we have one more piece of information to push the issue,
doesn't it?"

Letty pondered Dominique’s answer, which sounded like both a question
and a confirmation. *Assuming such a piece of information actually
exists…*

After about a minute of thought, she slowly opened her mouth. "If we had
a piece of information like that, I agree it would change things. I also
think it wouldn't be surprising if you, Dominique, had something. ...And
I also think you'd hide it and call it a surprise for later."

"You've got me there! Egret, you haven't been around me that long, yet
you understand me so well!" Dominique looked surprised and delighted.

Meanwhile, Letty’s gloom increased as her prediction came true. "Ah, so
that really was the case..."

The two standing side-by-side, with their contrasting expressions,
somehow looked strangely natural together. Realizing that she was
troubled and perplexed, yet felt no anxiety, Letty sighed again.

She had clearly become completely accustomed to her antics. Another
problem was that she wasn't entirely uncomfortable with it. Even if it
could be called a part of Dominique's charm, it was hard for Letty to
admit.

"Either way, what we need to do right now is escort the caravan and
Princess Tseren to the royal capital. That hasn't changed, and at this
distance… only a day or two away, it's unlikely they'll try something
again, right?"

"Well, I suppose so. Luckily, they didn't manage to send anyone to
inform their superiors."

If the commander had realized that ten men weren't enough, the situation
might have been different. Regardless of the reality, the misjudgement
was understandable; facing two women who could be mistaken for delicate
individuals. Of course, he'd paid the price for that mistake with his
body.

"Still, the lack of contact at their scheduled check-in will give us
away. But even if someone with enough authority to act immediately
figures out the anomaly and enters Cordor, it will definitely take more
than a day. By then, we'll be inside the capital, or at least near it,
so they won't be able to easily make a move."

"In other words, we can avoid the pursuit of Princess Tseren and the
caravan getting caught in the crossfire."

"Exactly. And it buys us time to figure out our next move."

Of course, they had interrogated the men for the time and location of
their scheduled check-in. However, they didn't have the luxury—in many
senses—or a high chance of success for small tricks like sending a false
contact. The only course of action was to focus solely on delivering
Tseren to a safe location. This had already been agreed upon between the
two.

"After that, we just need to be vigilant for any secondary or tertiary
plans that were preemptively laid as a precaution..."

"It's already a big undertaking to send a group of over thirty men;
considering the relationship between Gaschnar and Cordor, I doubt they
have much more leeway. But if their real target is something else, then
yes, that might be possible. What a pain."

Cordor and Gaschnar were neighboring countries, and due to the dry
climate, neither had the national wealth or abundant harvests comparable
to Valandia or Jurastin. Thus, border disputes were constant, and the
two often cycled repeatedly between small-scale wars and peace treaties.
While things had been relatively calm recently, rumors of trouble were
always circulating.

"So, we need maximum vigilance until we reach the royal capital..."

"That's the gist of it. Sorry, Egret, but practice will have to be
minimal for a while."

"...I see. That is very disappointing. But I understand."

The fight today had given her various understandings. She wanted to
practice before that feeling faded. But given the circumstances, this
wasn’t the time to prioritize personal desires.

When she nodded, Dominique looked troubled. "Honestly, don't say such
cute things. It looks like you saw something during the fight today,
didn't you?"

"Yes, I feel like I saw a different side of myself than before."

"Then, you should replay that in your head repeatedly. It's important to
commit the memory of moving as you wished, or even better than you
thought you could, to your mind."

"Is that how it works? ...Understood."

She nodded obediently. Today she had finally grasped that Dominique's
teachings held various meanings. She wanted to grasp what those were,
but since she lacked the time and leisure, she would at least try to
recall—

"Um, Letty-san, Dominique-san, are you done? What was the discussion
about? Princess Tseren is also curious." Ellie interrupted her thoughts.

"Ah,” A mischievous idea dawned on Dominique. “The general discussion is
settled. Now we just need to get the boss's approval. Egret here is
going to protect Princess Tseren."

Ellie instantly froze. A few seconds later, she slowly, slowly turned to
look at Letty, her eyes devoid of emotion. "...Letty-san, what is the
meaning of that? Could we perhaps go over there and talk? Slowly."

"Wait, wait, that's not wrong, but it's not right either... Fine, let's
go talk slowly over there. We probably have enough time for that.”
Stammering, Letty managed to mollify her, then cast a resentful glare at
Dominique. “...Is that okay?"

Dominique accepted the look with amusement and nodded a few times. "Go
on, appease your wife."

"...Whose fault is this... Oh well..." Shooting one last resentful
glare, Letty took Ellie's hand and pulled her towards a nearby shade.
With her hand suddenly grasped, Ellie followed meekly.

After about 30 minutes in seclusion…

Ellie returned with a full, beaming smile and slightly flushed cheeks,
while Letty's cheeks were also flushed, and she looked as if she had
done something she shouldn't have. Dominique, of course, did not commit
the vulgarity of asking about it. ...She just watched with a sly grin.

When asked why, he replies with a laugh.

It takes an adult's measure to swallow a girl's anxiety and confusion
whole.

When he pats his swollen belly, it rings with stubbornness and pride.

Up Next: The Presence of an Adult

The sound of a hardened resolve echoes well.
