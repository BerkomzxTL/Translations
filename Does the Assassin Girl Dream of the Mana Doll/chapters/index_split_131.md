## Chapter 154: Entangled Karma

And finally, the day arrived.

"I hereby declare the Swordsmanship Tournament open!"

When Batbayar announced this triumphantly, a roaring cheer, like a
rumble of the earth, echoed across the plaza. The commoners gathered in
front of the royal castle looked genuinely thrilled, suggesting they had
been eagerly awaiting this annual festival.

Mixed in with the crowd were faces that looked confidently defiant or
intensely focused. Some even wore vulgar, aggressive expressions. All
had the demeanor of being skilled with a weapon, and were presumably the
participants.

However, the weapons they carried were diverse. Some carried large,
thick greatswords. Others had weapons balanced in length and weight,
wielded with two hands but capable of being handled with one. Some
carried wide one-handed swords and shields. There were also those with
slender one-handed swords. Given the presence of people with extremely
curved scimitars, it seemed participants had gathered from many
different regions.

The weapons were varied, but there was a common factor among many of the
participants.

"Um. ...Doesn't it seem like a lot of people are wearing full plate
armor?" Ellie murmured quietly. Indeed, a considerable percentage of the
presumed participants were encased in full metal armor.

Dominique answered Ellie's very reasonable question while smiling, "Ah,
due to a rule change a long time ago, hits to the armor basically don’t
count."

"Huh? What kind of rule is that!?" It was no wonder Ellie cried out in
surprise. If hits were invalid when wearing armor, the effective
strategy would become fully encasing oneself in armor and trading blows.
A layperson might think this was far removed from the pursuit of
swordsmanship refinement.

"Well, in reality, being able to land an effective cut through metal
armor is difficult for any ordinary swordsman, let alone me. If you
consider it a push toward more realistic, practical swordsmanship, then
it makes some sense."

As a result of pursuing 'realism,' maneuvers like stabbing into the
chinks of the armor or striking the armor to inflict shock damage are
counted as valid hits. However, on a battlefield where metal armor is
commonplace, one would typically use a spear or a war hammer instead of
a sword. It was undeniable that trying to force a connection to reality
had created various inconsistencies.

"That's true, but... I don't know, it feels so wrong." Ellie pouted,
looking dissatisfied.

Dominique grinned. "I agree with that. That's part of the reason I
trained Egret."

"...I see? So, you want to challenge their way of thinking." Letty, the
person in question, looked at Dominique with a somewhat deadpan
expression.

Of course, Dominique didn't care about such a glance.

"That's right. You can do it now, can't you?"

"...I won't deny it."

To be honest, she was confident she could land a strike through armor,
provided certain conditions were met. Especially now, having been
trained by Dominique. She could also target the gaps, as she had been
practicing that before. She understood this well, which was why she
couldn't say much. It felt like even this thought was exactly what
Dominique wanted.

"I'm not going to lecture you about what swordsmanship is, but don't you
have things you dislike, things that aren't to your taste?"

"I can't deny that."

"Well I think it's wrong to try to justify using a person as bait that
way."

Both Ellie and Letty voiced their respective thoughts to the unrepentant
Dominique. The fact that a hostile atmosphere didn't arise was probably
due to their cumulative time together.

"Well, I won't deny that either. But how does that affect your
motivation to participate?"

"...I won't deny that I'm motivated. Though I also feel like I have no
right to talk about swordsmanship."

After all, her hands were stained with blood, and she carried a history
of sin. She knew full well that she was in no position to speak about
swordsmanship, but still.

Still.

Even if only briefly, the world of swordsmanship she encountered was
both profound and worthy of respect. Because of that, she couldn't
suppress her complex feelings toward what seemed like a simplistic
approach.

"I have a lot of thoughts, so I plan to express them with my sword in
the tournament," Letty declared.

"Hah! Hahaha..." Dominique suddenly burst out laughing.

Letty and Ellie stared at her, wondering what was so funny. When she
finally calmed down, she gave a knowing smile. "Egret, you've started
talking like a proper swordsman. I'm happy to hear you say something
like that."

Letty blinked once, then twice. She quickly turned her face away. Her
cheeks seemed to be slightly flushed.

But then, the side of her face suddenly became tense.

"Letty-san? Is something wrong?"

"Ah, no, well..."

Questioned by Ellie, she stammered. What she felt was intensely
instinctive and subjective. Something she would usually dismiss was now
calling for her utmost vigilance, sending shivers down her spine.

The object of her gaze was a swordsman encased in full plate armor. That
in itself wasn't cause for alarm.

"Hmm? What's that over there? He looks like a man-shaped tiger."

As Dominique commented, the swordsman's movements, despite being clad in
full armor of considerable mass, were natural and supple. The muscle
power was so great that the weight of the armor seemed insignificant.
His bearing was flexible and graceful, possessing extraordinary strength
without losing agility.

"...No way."

She knew only one person capable of such a feat. But he couldn't
possibly be here. She knew that better than anyone.

And yet.

The fully armored man looked over. He was definitely looking at Letty.

A shiver ran down her spine.

Surely he was smiling from behind his helmet.

The image conjured felt strangely vivid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the entanglement that binds a person with the passing of time and the
accumulation of deeds is called karma, then…

What it brings about is called causality.

She absolutely cannot allow herself to be simply swept away by that
which sometimes drives people mad.

Up Next: Beyond the Karma

She will cut it open and sweep it away. Because that’s what she has
decided.
