## Chapter 115: A Critical Hit

The training between Letty and Dominique continued for about an hour.

"Whoa, it's almost time to go. Let's call it a day. It's getting cold,
so make sure you wipe off all that sweat."

Dominique stopped moving as she said that. Immediately, the tip of
Letty's wooden sword dropped with a *thump*, and a big sigh escaped her
lips.

"...Dominique. You said it would be light, didn't you?"

"Yeah, I did. And your body can still move, right?"

Hearing her sound so resentful, Dominique laughed lightly. In fact,
Dominique herself was only a little sweaty and seemed as energetic as
ever. But...

"Yes, my body can still move. But my mind is pretty much at its
limit..." Letty replied with an exhausted look on her face.

The movements themselves weren't intense, so her body wasn't that tired.
However, as she had been constantly reading her opponent’s moves and
attempting to predict the follow-up, Letty's concentration was nearing
its limit.

And for Dominique, who was just following through with honed instinct,
it was just a light workout. All Letty could do was glare as Dominique
looked at her with a smug, easy-going smile.

"Still, it’s not like you can’t move, right? You'll recover enough to
use your detection magic again after a little rest. Ah, Ellie, get Egret
something sweet."

"Oh, yes, I have something ready."

"As expected, a perfect wife."

"Wha, whaaa?! Oh, no, it’s not like that!"

Ellie turned bright red under Dominique's teasing and waved her hands
around frantically. Despite putting on such a troubled face, she was
clearly delighted.

"Haha, too cute. What do you say, *husband*?"

"...Spare me... If you say things like that right now, I don't know how
to react..."

Letty muttered in a small voice, then hung her head as if her spirit had
completely left her.

\*\*\*

After teasing Letty to her heart's content, Dominique went back to the
caravan. As she approached the carriage she was going to ride in, the
caravan leader noticed her and came over.

"Welcome back, Dominique-san. I was watching from afar, and it was a
very interesting sight. It's amazing that a person can move like that."

"Oh my, I don't approve of peeping. ...Just kidding, I knew you were
watching."

Dominique laughed and climbed onto the driver's seat. It was a smooth
movement, as if she were gliding. That motion itself was also
impressive.

"Haha, it was a sight that drew a lot of attention. You seemed to be
having a lot of fun, too."

Dominique smirked in return to the smiling merchant.

"Oho, of course. It's not every day you find a girl who's so eager to
learn. She's so honest that she just absorbs everything."

She said that as she sat down in the driver's seat and leaned against
the backrest. ...A little deeper than she did the first time.

"I see. And you're working hard as a master because of that."

"...Hmph, it seems that guild leader of yours has taught you well. Well,
since I forced myself on her, it’s only right that I put in some effort
myself."

Dominique returned a wry smile as the leader’s comment implied he had
deduced something from her small gestures. She stretched her arms to
straighten her back and loosen her shoulders.

She had put on a brave face in front of Letty and had enough energy to
keep up appearances, but dealing with a student who was grasping the key
points so quickly was more tiring than she had expected. It felt a
little shameful.

But at the same time, she was grateful to have met such a student.

\*\*\*

…And that student was currently plopped on the ground, downing the lemon
water Ellie had prepared for her.

"Ahhh... Is this what 'refreshing' feels like...?"

"Fufu, I have some sweets too. They say sweet things help with fatigue,
so make sure you eat plenty."

"Mmh, thanks."

Letty reached out for the baked goods so quickly it seemed to generate a
gust of wind. When she ate one, it crumbled, filling her mouth with the
rich sweetness of honey. She looked satisfied.

As Letty was washing the snack down with lemon water, Ellie, who was
sitting next to her, muttered softly, "She said wife... husband."

"Guh, *cough*, *cough*!" The soft but happy voice took Letty by
surprise, causing her to choke on her drink.

Ellie smiled and patted her back. After a while, Letty finally calmed
down. Well, not mentally.

"Ellie, um... there are a lot of things I want to say, but... we'll be
in town soon. Can you wait until we get to the inn tonight?"

"Of course, but... when you speak so seriously, even I get
embarrassed..."

When her lighthearted joke, with a hint of expectation, was answered
with such seriousness, Ellie couldn't help but feel a little shy.

*Peek*. They stole quick glances at each other, and when their eyes met,
they looked away. But even as they blushed, they couldn't stop the
smiles from growing on their faces.

And that little exchange continued until the signal to depart was
announced.

Money, a great invention. A concept that quantifies trust.

That's why its use is the very essence of human relationships.

And people are often swept away and toyed with by it.

What if there is something pure in it?
