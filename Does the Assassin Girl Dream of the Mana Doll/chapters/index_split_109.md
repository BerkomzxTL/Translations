## Chapter 132: A Maiden's Preparations

"It looks like you had fun last night, hm?"

"Please, don't ask..."

—Just past noon, the next day, in a room at the merchant’s guild.

The merchant's errand boy had summoned Letty and the others. Letty, eyes
averted in distress, muttered quietly in response to Dominique's
teasing.

That was only natural. After all, Ellie had arrived, glowing, with a
visibly pleased and radiant smile, while Letty looked somewhat
exhausted, making it easy to imagine what had transpired. The only
difference was that no lines had been crossed, but the intense
atmosphere and the reactions of those around them made that a trivial
distinction.

And in that atmosphere, Ellie somehow looked proud and triumphant,
which, in turn, made Letty feel even more awkward. In the midst of this,
the merchant leader of the caravan, Rudolf, interjected.

"I apologize for summoning you both. As expected, His Majesty the King
has requested your presence."

"Ah, it was predictable, wasn't it..."

Letty responded almost in an attempt to distract herself. She gave him a
glance of gratitude, and he gave a small nod in return.

"Yes, you are to present yourselves this afternoon, around the time of
the third bell."

"It's really the very next day. Is he so eager to meet his daughter's
saviors, or is he simply conscientious, or both?"

"Both, I imagine. His Majesty Batbayar is that kind of person."

"Oh my? Aren't you from Valandia? Is it alright for you to be so fond of
the King of Cordor?"

Dominique teased Rudolf, who spoke with a hint of pride. But his smile
remained unwavering.

"I doubt His Majesty Leonhardt would take offense at such a small thing.
I respect both monarchs." His remark was unrepentant, delivered almost
as if it were a matter of course.

Hearing this, Dominique smiled in delight. "I see, a clever way to put
it."

Ellie, who was listening to the exchange, interjected from the side,
tilting her head. "Um, Batbayar... wasn't that Princess Tseren's name?"

"Ah, here it is customary to connect the father's name after the
individual's name. And they rarely carry a family name. Although the
royal family and others of high rank do use one out of necessity."

"I see, so that's why it's Tseren Batbayar Cordor."

It was natural for customs to differ between countries, and even more so
across time periods. Since Valandia and Jurastin had similar naming
conventions to Ellie's time, she hadn't paid much attention to it, but
traveling this far had made her keenly aware of the difference.

Then, she noticed something and turned to Letty. "Speaking of which, did
you already know about that name, Letty-san? You seemed like you did."

"Ah, yes. I had heard about it."

"As expected of Letty-san, so knowledgeable! ♪" Ellie looked at her with
sparkling eyes and her hands clasped to her chest.

Slightly overwhelmed, Letty replied, "Eh, no, not at all..."

Seeing this, Dominique spoke in a teasing voice, "Ellie, it's nice that
you're so smitten, but go easy on her. Your husband is clearly
troubled."

"Oh, that's right... I'm sorry, Letty-san, I was just so caught up." She
followed up with an unapologetic *tehe*.

"Caught up, you say…” Letty, however, could not get angry and only
managed to let out a small sigh. “Well, it's fine, I suppose..." After
all, she was secretly happy to be complimented by Ellie. Although she
felt a bit embarrassed for feeling that way.

"Well, anyway. Since we've been invited, let's present ourselves with
due solemnity."

"Yes, I suppose we can't refuse."

"Ah. Wait a minute, we're going before His Majesty the King, right? Are
these clothes alright?" Ellie pinched the hem of her robe.

It was originally a high-quality item with defensive magic enchanted on
it, but the long journey had undeniably left it looking worn.
Unfortunately, Letty was completely indifferent, and Dominique was
similar.

*Even though the summons came from the King, wouldn't it be rude to
appear like this?* She was worried, but—

"Eh, isn't it fine? His Majesty Leonhardt didn't mind."

"But, well, that was for work at the time. Our current outfits are kind
of like work clothes."

"I think it'll probably be fine. Wait, do you two realize you just
casually said something rather remarkable?"

At Dominique's dumbfoundedness, the two women exchanged glances. A few
seconds later, they both made an, “Ah!” as if remembering something.

"Well, um. It was just a coincidence that we happened to take that kind
of job, you know."

"Sure, but normally, coincidences like that don't just happen? I won't
pry further because I'm afraid of what I might find, but still..."

"But truly, it was a coincidence, honestly. It's a long story, and
complicated, so I'll stop here. But seriously, will our current attire
really be okay?"

As Ellie fell back into worried contemplation, Rudolf patted her
shoulder. He was wearing a gentle smile.

"Ellie-san, have you forgotten where you are and what this place deals
with?"

"Rudolf-san, that... could it be?"

"Yes, if you would allow us, we would be delighted to prepare suitable
attire for all of you. Aha, no need to worry about cost; all I ask is
the right to speak highly of your relationship with us here and there."

Seeing that cheerful sincerity, both Dominique and Letty smiled and
shared the same thought: *I knew it*. But one person reacted
differently.

"Rudolf-san. I will pay for it, so could you please prepare your best
clothes? For Letty-san. I really, really want to dress Letty-san up.
Could you please cooperate? You *will* cooperate, won't you?"

As Ellie slowly approached with an intense, dead-serious look he had
never seen before, Rudolf flinched and slowly backed away.

Witnessing this, Letty let out a sigh. "Ellie, a moderate outfit is fine
for me... please don't put so much pressure on him."

She pleaded with her while groaning.

A change of country brings a change of atmosphere.

The cityscape, the flowing water, and even the wind.

A change in the wind brings a change in the people. And even more so for
those who stand above them.

Is this what good-naturedness is?
