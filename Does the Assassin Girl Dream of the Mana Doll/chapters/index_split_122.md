## Chapter 145: What’s Left Behind

Once Ellie regained her composure, they resumed their exploration.
Through skirmishes with golems and various other monsters, Ellie became
accustomed to using the adjusted Mana Blaster. It was unavoidable that
firing took more time initially compared to the regular blaster.
However, with repeated use, the sequence for adjusting the convergence
rate could be done almost instantly, and now she could fire it in nearly
the same amount of time.

"You're getting pretty smooth with your shots."

"Yes... I never thought I'd be able to do something like this. Thanks to
it, I can also save on magical power consumption… It's nothing but good
news!"

"That's great. As always, training is important in everything."

"W-Well, I don't like that attitude of 'practice solves everything,'
but..."

While sensing a hint of danger in the sparkle of Letty's eyes, Ellie
looked down at her own hands.

"But it's kind of strange. Painting, of course, but also things like
this… Improving with practice. I never actually did any practice or
training related to combat."

"Really? I thought your movements were quite practiced."

"They are. From the beginning, the data for those movements, like how to
move my body, was loaded into my memory core."

Mana Dolls like Ellie could move according to data embedded in the
memory device in their heads. It was also possible to thoroughly train
one unit and then transfer the learned movement data to other
individuals. Because of this, Ellie was deployed to combat without any
proper training, and no significant problems arose. There was no need to
deliberately spend time on practice.

"Yet, here I am, practicing and improving my combat skills. ...It's
strange. I'm happy. It makes me feel... human."

Ellie's expression as she murmured certainly looked happy. But there was
also a hint of confusion. Letty observed Ellie's profile, thought for a
moment, and then spoke, "Hmm. ...I think it's fine to be happy about
it."

Ellie tilted her head curiously.

"You think so? Doesn't it seem... weird?"

"No, it's not weird."

"I don't think getting excited over something like this is very cute,
though."

"Don't worry, you're always cute to me."

Clearly and definitively. Ellie immediately stopped moving and stared
intently at Letty.

"Letty-san."

"What is it?"

"That's exactly it, that's it! What if I die of embarrassment after
hearing you say something like that in a dangerous place like these
ruins, you flirt!"

Ellie, her face completely red, closed the distance, and Letty
instinctively backed away from the intensity of her glare. With a
troubled frown, she raised both hands in surrender.

"I'm sorry, I was wrong. I'll think about the time and place when I say
things like that."

"As long as you understand, as long as you understand! ...Huh? No. Do
you actually understand...?"

Ellie started walking again, still looking somewhat unconvinced. It was
about time they reached the Research Facility, or rather, they wanted to
be there soon.

Though not with the precision of those owned by nobles, commoners could
acquire clocks accurate enough to tell the approximate time. Their own
clock, set just before they entered the ruins, was nearing the sixth
hour bell—around sunset.

Inside the ruins, where sunlight never reached, one’s sense of time was
easily lost. Some adventurers would think, "It's fine, I'll just keep
going until I'm tired and then rest," but that type usually died
quickly. Humans often don't notice fatigue while their bodies are
moving. It’ll hit suddenly, and if a monster appeared in that moment of
weakness, they wouldn’t stand a chance.

Capable adventurers who knew from experience and knowledge that human
senses were unreliable managed their time with clocks and took regular
breaks. Letty and Ellie were no exception, but it was about time for a
proper rest, not just a short break. Therefore, reaching the Research
Facility would provide peace of mind.

Thinking this, they continued for a while longer.

"...This should be the place."

"Here? ...It doesn't look much different from anywhere else, though."

"The inside of the building goes underground, so the part above ground
isn't that large."

*I see, that makes sense,* Letty nodded, then initiated an Active Search
spell towards the interior. After confirming there were no humans,
monsters, or golems moving inside, she nodded to Ellie. Ellie nodded
back and began operating a panel next to the door.

After a while, the panel lit up, and with a small *pssht* sound, the
door opened. Letty carefully checked the inside, then sniffed the air,
confirming it was safe to enter.

"With you, Ellie, I bet we could make a fortune exploring different
ruins," Letty couldn't help but murmur at the door as it opened without
trouble

Ellie looked back with a beaming smile. "Shall we do it? I'm okay with
it."

Letty thought for a few seconds while looking at her.

"...I'll pass. It would take away time from your painting."

"...Honestly! T-H-A-T is exactly what I mean, Letty-san!"

"Eh, no, I just said what I genuinely thought."

"It's precisely because you're so naturally clueless that the damage to
me is so great!"

Grumbling *This is unreasonable* in her heart, Letty entered the room,
which appeared to be the laboratory. Once inside, Ellie operated a panel
inside to close and lock the door.

"This should prevent anyone from entering easily from the outside."

"Good, thank you. Well, if there's nothing inside, that is."

Exchanging words, they cautiously proceeded. Although her Active Search
confirmed no signs of enemies, it was possible they were undetectable if
they were using anti-detection magic. They continued, their footsteps
echoing in the quiet building.

Although Letty could walk without making any sound, Ellie had
complained, "I feel uneasy when I sense no one behind me," so Letty was
deliberately making noise.

In any case, they proceeded slowly, paying attention to their
surroundings.

"Yes, it seems this place is definitely related to Mana Doll research. I
see familiar items everywhere."

"Looks like we hit the jackpot, that's good."

"Structurally, the storage vault should be down this way."

Following Ellie's guidance, they walked for a while longer. Without
encountering any monsters, they reached what appeared to be the storage
vault.

"This door has a stricter password than the other rooms... Letty-san,
I'll be vulnerable for a while, could you please guard the
surroundings?"

"Of course, leave it to me."

Letty nodded, put her hand on her shortsword, and focused her attention
on the surroundings. Ellie reached into her hair and pulled out a cord
from the back of her head.

"...What is that?"

"It's a cord for accessing information devices. Using this, I can
control terminals like this more directly."

Ellie then plugged the cord into a port on the panel. *Huh? Feels like
I’m forgetting something…* She paused briefly, but continued the access
process anyway.

"O-ow-ow-ow!?"

"Ellie!?"

Startled by Ellie's sudden scream, Letty whipped around. Seeing her
expression of agony, Letty reached for the cord, thinking it must be the
problem.

"W-Wait, don't pull it out now, that would be even worse!"

"Eh, b-but if this is the problem..."

"It *is* a problem, but suddenly pulling it out is *more* of a problem!"

While tearfully calming the flustered Letty, Ellie intervened in the
accessed panel terminal and successfully opened the door. Enduring the
pain, she finished the process and pulled out the cord before collapsing
onto her knees as if all strength had left her body.

"T-That was tough... I forgot..."

"Are you alright? Come on, sit down and rest."

"I'm sorry, thank you..."

Letty laid a blanket on the floor so it wouldn't be cold and helped
Ellie sit on it. Letty sat beside her, wrapping her arm around Ellie's
shoulder to support her, pulling her close. Ellie leaned into her
affectionately, closed her eyes, and took several deep breaths to regain
her composure. As the pain subsided, she slowly opened her eyes.

"Phew... the pain is going away..."

"That's good, but... what was that just now?"

Letty, who had been anxiously studying Ellie's face, sighed in relief at
her more settled expression. When she posed the question, Ellie looked
troubled and embarrassed.

"Well, you see. The reason we came here in the first place was to get a
replacement for the information processing circuit that broke when I
used that code before. So, I accidentally tried to use the broken
circuit again... It was like, trying to use a broken arm by mistake."

Letty frowned, having understood Ellie's explanation.

"...That must have hurt like hell..."

"Yes, well, it did... But if I suddenly pulled it out, it would be the
same as before, like a compound fracture."

"So you had no choice but to push through with it, even though it hurt."

"That's right..."

As she looked exhausted, almost haggard, Letty stroked Ellie's head. She
readily melted into her touch. After resting like that for a while,
Ellie seemed to have recovered slightly.

"Okay, I'm fine now! Let's look for the parts inside."

"Are you really okay? You can rest longer if you need to."

"No, there's no point in wasting more time."

When Ellie stood up, Letty reluctantly stood up too. Supporting the
slightly unsteady Ellie, the two stepped inside.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removing the broken part and replacing it.

A supposedly commonplace task is suddenly anything but when it befalls
oneself.

And even less so when it concerns a person one cherishes.

Up Next: Absent-Minded

Where exactly is her heart wandering?
