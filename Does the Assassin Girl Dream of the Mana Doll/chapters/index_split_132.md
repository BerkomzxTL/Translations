## Chapter 155: Beyond the Karma

The swordsman watched Letty for a while, but then suddenly turned his
head, as if he had been called by someone. The pressure she felt
weakened as his gaze shifted. However, there still wasn’t much distance
between the two. Unable to let her guard down, she couldn't take her
eyes off him.

He looked at Letty one more time.

And smirked.

Or at least, that’s how it seemed. Even though no expression could be
seen through his full-face helmet. With that, he slowly walked away in
the direction he seemed to have been called from.

She couldn't bring herself to look away until his figure completely
vanished, and only when he had disappeared into the crowd did she let
out the breath she had been holding.

"Hmm, seems like there's a story there. It's rare for you to be so
shaken."

"Yes, well... It's a bit difficult to talk about here."

If it *was* him, she couldn't discuss what had happened in such a
crowded place. Sensing something from Letty's troubled expression,
Dominique nodded lightly.

"Well, your preliminary group is the last one, so we'll have time to
talk while we catch our breath somewhere."

Since Letty's recommendation was submitted just before the application
deadline, she was in the final preliminary group. This group was a mixed
bag, reserved for those who rush in at the last minute, those who hold
back to be dramatic, and those who have a complicated history.

"Speaking of which... Which group is that guy in?"

"The area he was in is where the first group gathers, so he's probably
in the very first group. ...Want to watch?"

Letty thought for a moment. Then, she nodded slowly.

"I think I’ll be able to confirm my suspicions."

"I see, that makes sense."

Dominique nodded in return. Then, Ellie spoke up from the side.

"Ah, in that case, since we have the opportunity, why don't we accept
Princess Tseren's invitation?"

"...Princess Tseren's invitation?"

Letty tilted her head, hearing the phrase for the first time.

"Actually, she invited us during the banquet the other day. She asked if
we'd like to watch the preliminaries from the royal seats."

"When did that conversation happen... But, well, that might be just
right. ...Maybe it would be better if they heard what I have to say."

A bad feeling was strongly pressing on her. She felt like this was
something they shouldn't ignore.

\*\*\*

Both Tseren and Batbayar readily accepted Ellie's request. This was
because:

"So, you're saying we get to watch with Big Sis Dominique's commentary?"

"Well, if you wish. Oh, and one or two drinks would be nice, too."

"There's no way you won't get them, sister."

That was the reason. At any rate, they were welcomed and were able to
watch the preliminaries from the seats reserved for the royal family.

"What... What is that?"

Tseren's voice, full of bewilderment, was murmured to no one in
particular. Next to her, Ellie was also speechless.

It was a one-sided massacre.

First, he casually stepped in. A distance of what must have been over
three meters.

Then, he swung his sword effortlessly. The massive sword moved as
lightly as a feather. The opponent, who managed to receive the sudden
approach with his sword despite his surprise, must have been a skilled
swordsman. However, the sword still struck with speed too fast for the
defense to react, sending the armored swordsman flying. An unfortunate
contestant who was in the path of the flying body was caught and
collapsed with a tremendous crash.

Alarmed by the preposterous noise, the remaining contestants stopped
moving and focused their attention solely on *him*.

The one closest to him probably made eye contact. That must have been
the only reason. The next moment, he was swept aside.

Instinctively realizing the danger, two men who had made eye contact and
attacked simultaneously were sent tumbling with a single horizontal
sweep before their swords could reach him. A man who sneaked up from
behind to exploit the gap was easily struck down with a snap turn,
without even properly gauging the distance.

From then on, the arena instantly devolved into a chaotic maelstrom.

Contestants scattering in fear upon seeing the vast difference in power,
and those trying desperately to fight back, clashed everywhere. Those
whose movements stopped were equally cut down. Those who were lucky
enough to submit their withdrawal in time were fortunate; others were
struck down from behind before they could do so.

In various ways, and without exception, mercilessly. With every breath,
one person, then another.

And before long, *he* was the only one standing in the center of the
arena, which was so quiet that not even a murmur, let alone the expected
roar of the crowd, could be heard.

"...Hey, sister. What is that? Is he even human?" Batbayar had lost all
color in his face.

Dominique replied dismissively, "He's human, no doubt about that. He's
just a bit too loved by the gods."

Batbayar, as the host of the swordsmanship tournament, should have been
excited by intense matches and master swordsmen, but all he felt was
revulsion.

This was not a match. It was one-sided violence, a slaughter. Neither
Batbayar nor the audience had the sensibility to enjoy it.

"It's him after all... why, how..."

"Letty-san, 'him,' you mean... Ah, could it be...?"

Letty’s expression was as if she had chewed on a bitter insect, and her
face suggested she suddenly remembered something from those words. But
what did that mean?

"I remember that movement and sword style. That’s... Curtis."

"But wasn't he...?"

"Yes. ...The man I was supposed to have killed."

When she said that, Batbayar's eyebrow rose, and Tseren covered her
mouth with both hands. Unease spread among the knights serving as
guards.

"I confirmed that he was dead, too...?"

"Yes, I checked thoroughly too. But that movement... I can't think of
anyone else."

More than anything, that persistent, clinging presence. The feeling of
being watched even when she wasn't, of constantly being caught in the
net he cast, was something she hadn't felt from anyone else.

"Hey, hey, what’s going on if he's supposed to be dead? Was some kind of
forbidden necromancy used on him?"

"That's the only thing I can think of... Though it's unlikely."

Necromancy.

It was magic that involved the corpses of humans and animals, capable of
animating dead bodies or transforming them into different monsters.
Naturally, it was a forbidden magic, not something ordinary people could
use.

Crucially, a corpse was needed, but his remains had been left in the
deepest part of that ruin. Even with the reduced number of monsters,
there shouldn't have been many people who could reach that far.

"But before the preliminaries, there’s always an inspection to check for
magical cheating! Are you telling me there's someone who can use
counter-magic that slips past our court mages’ detection?"

"Yes. If that's the case. Then the reason such people are participating
must be for something bad."

"Well, that figures..."

Curtis alone was trouble enough, but if there was a powerful necromancer
behind him… Whatever their goal, Batbayar, as the King, would have to
take some action, including protecting his own life.

"Father, is it possible... to disqualify him or prevent him from
participating?"

"I'd like nothing more, but that's impossible. First, we don't have
enough proof until we can expose any cheating. And another thing, what
would it look like to the public if someone who showed such monstrous
strength in the preliminaries of a tournament where the royalty endorsed
a contestant was disqualified for an unknown reason? If we could expose
the cheating, we could do anything, but..."

He was a presence revealed in the first, most watched preliminary match
of the tournament. Trying to pretend he didn't exist at this point would
be utterly impossible. If so, what should they do? While Batbayar was
considering countermeasures, someone spoke up casually.

"Huh, don't worry about it. These guys went through the trouble of
joining the tournament, so they're definitely aiming for the
championship. In that case, the problem's solved if Egret wins, right?"

Dominique showed her usual confident grin, leaving Batbayar and Tseren
speechless. Ellie looked convinced.

"You say that with a lot of confidence... but I only managed to kill him
because it was a surprise attack," Letty complained, frowning with a
troubled look.

But Dominique seemed entirely unconcerned, remaining at ease. "Haha, I
get how you feel. But back then was back then, now is now. Things are
different."

Then, she glanced at the arena. It was still eerily quiet, even though
'he' was no longer there.

"After all, that guy... He looks like a tiger, but he's no tiger."

Dominique dismissed him with a smile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The will resolved to cut through is like a blade facing a raging wind.

She herself has decided to press forward, pushing through the storm that
tries to beat her down.

It’s in this moment that it will blossom.
