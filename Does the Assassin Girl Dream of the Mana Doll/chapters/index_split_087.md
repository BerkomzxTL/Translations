## Chapter 110: Surprise Attack

Some time passed as Dominique told them eyebrow-raising stories of her
past, random anecdotes, and technical talk about swordsmanship. As the
break ended, they had to push away the still talkative Dominique in
order to return to the caravan and continue their journey.

The caravan's formation remained the same as before, with Ellie on the
left of the carriages and Letty on the right. They proceeded down the
road, keeping an eye on their surroundings. In a few more hours, they
were expecting to reach their destination for the day, a post town.

"Dominique-san, a group is approaching us from the left! Five on
horseback, and ten to twenty on foot! The riders are coming ahead
without waiting for the others!"

Ellie suddenly brought her horse closer and reported to Dominique, who
was seated in the middle of the caravan. Dominique's expression became
serious as she nodded.

"Alright, got it! ...And that's a very clear report," she replied,
mumbling in admiration.

She had heard that Ellie had served in the army, and it seemed it wasn't
just for a short period. She gave off the impression of being very
experienced. Of course, that didn't mean she had any intention of prying
into her past.

"The riders intend to engage us and stop our movement, then the main
body of foot soldiers will come! They'll probably fan out soon. Archers,
get ready! Fire at will! Ellie, unleash hell when they get in range and
fire another shot when the foot soldiers get closer! Egret, I don't
think it's likely with that scale, but there's a possibility of a
diversion. Use your detection magic on the opposite side and stay
vigilant!"

"Yes, understood!"

"You got it!"

"Understood."

They all replied to Dominique's rapid-fire instructions and prepared for
battle.

The archers hurriedly readied their bows and nocked their arrows. Ellie
dismounted her horse and held up her staff, gathering mana. She also
pretended to chant a spell just in case. Letty, after shooting a quick,
worried glance at Ellie, reluctantly went to guard the opposite
direction.

And just as the riders were about to spread out, they entered Ellie's
range.

"Here I go! Mana Blaster!"

After proudly announcing it to give them time to prepare for the shock,
she unleashed her attack. It immediately turned the world white for all
who witnessed the sight. It was a violent light, as if a second sun had
appeared. A deafening sound vibrated in their ears, followed by a
shockwave. For a few seconds, they endured a roaring wind.

When the wind finally died down and everyone’s vision returned, all that
remained was a crater where the bandits once were. The group that had
been following behind them all ended up losing the strength in their
legs and could no longer stand.

...The caravan escorts were equally paralyzed.

"...Well, I did say 'unleash hell,' but still..."

"It might be even more powerful than before. Dominique, what should we
do? Should we tie them up?"

Only Dominique, Letty, who was used to such scenes, and the source of
the trouble, Ellie, were able to move properly. Dominique shrugged and
looked at Letty with a dumbfounded expression.

"Yeah, let's just tie them up. We don't need to chase anyone who tries
to run. ...Only you, me, and Ellie can move. So let's go, the three of
us."

"Understood. I'll grab some leather cords."

And so, they met up with Ellie and headed toward the bandits who were
still on the ground. Not a single one had recovered enough to run away.

\*\*\*

"To be honest, Ellie. And I'm sorry to say this, but that wasn't as
powerful as I thought it would be."

Dominique suddenly spoke as they were tying up the bandits and loading
them onto the carriages. Everyone around her froze.

"...Eh?"

"Pardon me? Um, you think so? I think that's the first time I've ever
heard that..."

"No, no, Dominique-san, that's not right. How can you say that after
seeing that?"

After a moment of silence, a chorus of protests poured in, and Dominique
responded with a wry smile.

"Ah, the sheer power was indeed remarkable. I've never seen anything
like it before, to be honest. But the monstrous amount of mana you were
gathering just didn't feel right. I know it's a bit rich coming from me,
a person who can't even use magic."

The guards, who couldn't sense mana, looked at her with a clear "What is
she talking about?" expression. Ellie was still processing the words she
had never been told before. Letty, on the other hand, was deep in
thought.

"Sorry, it just got me wondering. But still, it had that kind of power,
and Ellie doesn't look tired at all. It's certainly more than enough to
be an escort."

Dominique's tone became more jocular to lighten the strange silence that
had fallen upon the group. The others, though still not entirely
convinced, eventually nodded and returned to their positions. Ellie also
started to get on her horse, but—

"Ellie, wait a minute. You can only fire that Mana Blaster in a straight
line, right?"

"Pardon? Um... I've never used it in any other way."

"Ah, well, I guess that's how they'd normally teach you. But just for a
try, can't you sweep it horizontally like this while you're firing?"

Dominique demonstrated a horizontal sweeping motion as she asked. Ellie
thought about the firing sequence and the time from firing to the end of
the shot.

"Now that you mention it, I feel like I could. It sounds like it would
be very useful. Can I have a moment to try?"

"Yeah, it's just a quick thing. I don't think they'll mind, will they?"

Dominique posed the latter question to the caravan leader, who gave his
consent with a smile.

"Then I'll try it, but with a lot less power."

Ellie hopped off her horse, took her stance with her staff, and then
pretended to chant a spell. She gathered mana in her right hand.

"Mana Blaster."

The blast, with its power greatly reduced, didn't have the same roar or
flash as before. Even so, when it swept across the ground, it still
vaporized the grass and left a wide scorched area. The guards were left
in awe once again.

"Yeah, that's much better. Ellie, if we run into bandits again, don't
use your full strength. Just sweep them like that with a decent amount
of power. Otherwise, these guys will be useless."

"Oh, uh, y-yes. Understood...?"

Ellie was a little taken aback by the effect. She could only quietly
accept as Dominique told her what to do.

International—to be between borders.

Often an exhibition of friction and conflict.

Sometimes you run in terror, sometimes you're crushed, and sometimes you
survive.
