## Chapter 123: An Agonizing Interrogation

During the excitement between Tseren and Ellie, the attackers were
packed into the baggage cart by the guards, leaving only the man who
seemed to be the commander and a few others.

"Well now, I'd like to hear what they have to say, but... it looks like
these guys won't break easily," Dominique said with a troubled smile,
standing before the remaining men and observing their expressions.

Despite being defeated, restrained, and having their pride utterly
crushed, their faces and eyes showed no sign of it. Just as Dominique
had assessed, they were likely properly trained soldiers, probably those
who had even received anti-interrogation training. If so, their position
was easy to imagine, but she doubted they would easily offer
confirmation.

"Egret, what do you suggest?"

"Hmm... the basics, I guess."

She drew her shortsword without hesitation. Immediately, blood spurted
from the commander's shoulder and arm. It was her usual technique:
slicing only the skin without damaging any major arteries.

However.

"...Hmph. Did you do something? It barely even itches." The man smiled
brazenly, without twitching an eyebrow or changing his expression.

Seeing his demeanor, Dominique conceded, *Just as I thought.*

“I see,” Letty just nodded, glancing sideways at the state of his
subordinates. "Then, how about this?"

Suddenly, she slashed not at the commander, but at one of his
subordinates.

"Guuuh!"

Perhaps it was the element of surprise, but a sound of pain escaped her
new target. Compared to the commander, his training seemed a little lax.

Seeing this, the commander, however, still kept a completely straight
face and spoke in a flat tone, "...So what?"

Even as he said this, his eyes flickered slightly, exchanging a look
with his men. His subordinates understood that his words were not his
true intention. But there was one more person who understood.

"Yeah, that's a lie. You're flustered. I guess you care about your
subordinates after all," Letty stated matter-of-factly.

Being struck with her observation, the man flinched, showing a reaction
for just a moment. Letty, of course, did not miss it. She narrowed her
eyes. "It seems that's the case. ...And you men seem to be aware of how
much he cares about you."

She slowly shifted her gaze to the subordinates, who were looking at
their commander with concern. A few of them visibly crumpled as her eyes
passed over them. *This is the target*, she thought as she walked up to
one of them. "Is that true for you, too?"

"Hah! Don't be ridiculous! Of course not!"

"That's also a lie.” Coldly, matter-of-factly. “You should have trained
a little more on how to hide it better." She turned her wrist. Blood
scattered everywhere. The man clamped his mouth shut and endured the
fresh wound.

Letty continued, "...So you're that type, after all... Dominique, hand
me *that*."

"Huh? This? You don't mean..." Dominique's face, as she handed it over
as instructed, clearly read ‘that's nasty.’

"Yes, I do." Ignoring her, Letty took it.

And casually rubbed it into the man's wound.

Salt.

"Guuugh!?"

Perhaps it was too much to bear, as the man let out a cry of agony.

The commander, watching, opened his mouth. "Hey, now. He doesn't know
anything, so you're wasting your time." His voice was perfectly steady,
a tone of complete exasperation.

“That's a lie too.” Though it was so well acted that she was almost
impressed that he could pull it off in this situation. “He seems to know
something. You're quite fond of your men, trying to turn the focus onto
yourself."

"...What are you talking about? I just find it ridiculous." As the
commander sneered, the gaze of his subordinates was filled with nothing
but trust. That alone revealed the depth of their relationship.

"I see. Then, I'll ask you." Saying that, she rubbed salt into the
commander's wound.

His brow furrowed for an instant, but he quickly maintained a placid
expression. "What, are you going to disinfect my wound? How thoughtful
of you."

"...Yes, quite impressive. Well, I suppose it's time for the main
event." Letty easily eased her hand. The commander looked perplexed, but
in just a few moments, he would be writhing in agony from the calamity
about to befall him.

Indeed.

By the feather duster that Letty casually pulled out.

\*\*\*

"Gyhahahahahaha!! Hee-hee!! Stop, stop it! Wah! Ahahahahaha!!"

The man's scream-like laughter soon resounded.

He was tickled all over with the feather duster with an exquisite level
of pressure, writhing from the sensation, unable to resist. He couldn't
help but thrash around, exposing a humiliating lack of control.

This went on for over thirty minutes.

Seeing their commander in such a state, the subordinates couldn't help
but look distraught. *We didn't want to see him like this.* It was
clearly written on all their faces.

Meanwhile, Letty calmly and methodically gauged the man's reaction,
tickling him relentlessly. Suddenly, she stopped. The commander
immediately collapsed, unable to control his gasping for air.

As she continued to observe his state, Letty slowly turned to his
subordinates. "...I think if I tickle him just a little bit more, he'll
lose control of his bladder and things will get messy. If you talk, I'll
stop, okay?"

Yes.

Her target wasn’t the commander. She had been targeting his
subordinates. She deliberately pushed them into a situation that would
heighten their mutual trust and respect for their commander, only to
then drop him to the brink of having his dignity crushed.

*We don't want to see this,* coupled with, *We can't control it
ourselves*. As they were driven into a corner, a helping hand—albeit the
devil's—was extended.

"I-I understand! We'll talk, we'll talk! Just stop, please!"

"Just so you know, I can tell if you're lying."

They already knew she could tell lies from their previous exchanges. The
men had no choice but to speak the truth.

\*\*\*

After they had confessed everything, Dominique, who had been watching
with an impressed expression, spoke to Letty curiously, "Hey, Egret. You
said you weren't very good at interrogation, but *this* is 'not very
good'?"

"Huh, ah, yeah. Because what I did wasn't interrogation; it was torture.
I know someone who's a master at getting people to confess everything
with just words, without using methods like this, and I'm nowhere near
her level."

She had a slightly regretful look on her face. She was nowhere near the
level of that person, who was usually lively and friendly, but could
switch between various expressions to draw out the opponent's words when
necessary. The one who she secretly considered an older sister figure.

"...You're comparing yourself to the wrong person, aren't you?"

Even though she had never met her, Dominique had a conflicted smile on
her face.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glimpsing the intricately woven plots and schemes, one will invariably
hesitate and agonize.

But it’ll be crushed without worry.

We’re ladies made of steel, scatter us if you can.

She is a lady. Handle with care.
