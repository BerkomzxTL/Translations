## Chapter 117: The Form of a Feeling

After parting ways with Letty, Ellie arrived at their inn and settled
down in the room they had been assigned. It was a double room; it seemed
the merchant who arranged it had been thoughtful. There were two beds
provided.

*Not that we'll use both*, Ellie thought to herself. She didn't mean
anything naughty. Absolutely not. Probably. Maybe.

Somehow, she had completely gotten used to the two of them sleeping
together, and on these winter nights, it was actually hard to sleep
without each other's warmth.

...At least Ellie certainly felt that way. And she was sure Letty must
feel the same. Lately, Letty would always be waiting for her in bed as a
matter of course. And the sense of happiness when she snuck into her
arms...

Noticing her thoughts wandering, Ellie snapped back to reality and
vigorously shook her head. She smoothed her slightly messy hair and ran
her fingers through it. *Haah*, she sighed softly. Glancing out the
window, the sun had already completely set. She combed her hair with her
fingers a few more times as she watched the darkness outside.

...She couldn't settle down.

Ellie wasn't so dense or uncouth as to miss the implications of Letty's
words and actions during their break today. At least, she didn't think
she was. She didn't think their bond was so shallow that she wouldn't be
able to tell. And she was pretty sure Letty felt the same way.

She was confident that was the case. And yet, she had a fear that made
her think, *No, that can't be right*. Her confidence was stronger, but
anxiety still seeped in through the cracks.

She knew it. She wasn't human. Even with the necessary biological parts,
ultimately she was nothing more than a manufactured item—a weapon, a
tool.

She knew it. Letty didn't care. Her past as a weapon was over, a matter
of no consequence.

Above all else, she *knew* it. Letty cared for her.

That's why she couldn't calm down. What did that care mean? Was it
something she was allowed to accept?

She didn't know. That's why she thought her desire for Letty to put it
into words was selfish.

"But you're going to say what you want to say, aren't you?" She
murmured, alone.

With a small sigh, the words that went unheard scattered into the air.
Now, no one would hear them. Or perhaps, she fleetingly wished they
would be heard, a contradictory thought.

"...I can't relax..."

Fidgeting. She played with her hair again. Her hair, illuminated by the
dim, red light of the lamp, took on an amber hue, different from how it
looked under the daylight sun. She combed it, held it up to the light,
and let it flow smoothly.

*I wish my anxiety would flow away just as easily.*

As she was thinking such silly thoughts, her ears caught the sound of
footsteps. Light and quiet, with no sense of weight. Surely, this sound
was...

Realizing who it was, Ellie quickly ran her fingers through her hair
again. This time, making sure it was neat and presentable. Then, she
checked to see if her clothes were tidy.

Just as she finished, a knock came at the door—

"Ellie, it's me. Are you there?"

An unmistakable voice. She noticed her expression soften as she replied.

"Ah, yes, Letty-san, it's open."

*Click*, the door opened quietly, and Letty walked in.

"Um, should I say 'I'm back'?"

"Fufu, I think that's fine. Welcome back, Letty-san."

Even that brief exchange made her feel like her face was going to melt
into a smile. *This is just like...* As all the back-and-forth from the
afternoon flashed through her mind, her face threatened to flush red.

Letty sat down gently next to Ellie as she was inwardly fluttering. It
was an extremely close distance, almost shoulder-to-shoulder.

*No.*

*Thump*, their shoulders touched. That alone made her almost flinch.

"Hey, Ellie. Do you remember what happened this afternoon?"

"Y-y-yes! I, I remember... it."

Seeing her stammer in obvious fluster, Letty chuckled softly. *She
probably remembers it as much as I do, and thinks it's just as
important.*

"...I see. ...Can I say it now?"

"Wha-well, um, yes, could you wait just a moment?"

She had been waiting. She had been preparing. But all of it had already
gone out the window. Her defenses were effortlessly stripped away, and
her restlessness was at an all-time high. She took several slow, deep
breaths to try and calm herself down.

"Y-yes, I think I'm ready. Please."

She braced herself and faced Letty. ...She was fully aware that her face
was already bright red.

"Thank you. ...Even though I'm saying this, what I want to say isn't
very well organized... But there is one thing I absolutely have to say."

As she spoke, she looked directly into Ellie's eyes, and Ellie couldn't
look away. Unable to move, she could only receive the words that Letty
spun, words that were as direct as her gaze.

"I love you, Ellie. I want to be with you forever, and I don't want to
be without you. I'll do anything for that, and I want to grant any wish
you have. ...I'm someone who, you know… I didn’t understand what this
feeling was."

She paused, then gently pressed her hands to her chest. As if embracing
something very, very precious. Her expression was breathtakingly gentle
and soft.

"When you called us 'wife' and 'husband,' Ellie... I was so, so happy. I
was incredibly embarrassed, too... but more than that, I was happy. I'm
sorry I couldn't put it into words at that moment."

"What?! You have nothing to apologize for! I was just being awkward and
trying to hide my embarrassment!"

The words wouldn't come out. Letty, who was not particularly eloquent,
was speaking slowly and haltingly, and Ellie's usually talkative tongue
wouldn't move at all. She didn't want it to move. She wanted to just
listen forever.

"Hehe, thank you. ...And then I understood. I want to be with you in
*that way*, Ellie. Since we're both women, maybe it won’t be husband and
wife, but... I've always wanted to be together, but, that… I realized I
wanted us to be together in a slightly different way."

"Um, Letty-san, are you saying—"

She had the sensation that her thought circuits were heating up and
about to fry. She understood the words. But it felt too good to be true,
and her mind was refusing to process and accept it. Because, it sounded
just like...

"Ellie. Will you stay by my side, forever? In sickness and in health?"

Her breath was whisked away. Unable to move, all she could manage was to
just, just stare at Letty before her. After what felt like seconds,
minutes, or hours, she finally opened her trembling lips.

"Yes, of course, yes! Absolutely, I'll be with you forever, wherever you
go!"

She couldn't hold back anymore and threw her arms around her. As she
hugged Letty tightly, Letty hugged her back just as firmly. The embrace
she received, a little stronger than her usual gentle one, transmitted
the excitement of the normally calm girl. Overwhelmed with joy, a soft
sigh escaped her.

"...Thank you. I'm so happy you said that."

"What are you saying? It's a given, it's a given! I belong to you,
Letty-san! Master or not, I belong to you!"

She wasn't sure what she was even saying herself. But she *knew* it was
getting through. The strength in Letty's arms around her tightened.

"...I don't deserve you."

"That's my line. You're the one I don't deserve, Letty-san!"

They exchanged similar endearments, laughing through their tears. They
had known they connected, but hearing it put into words made it all the
more certain. She felt like it was firmly engraved in her heart.

"...Hey, Ellie."

"Yes? ...Ah, yes..."

Letty's arms loosened slightly. *Huh?* she thought before seeing the
face she believed to be so precious so close to hers. Realizing what the
unusually passionate look in Letty's eyes was pleading for, she blushed
and closed her eyes in shyness.

She heard the sound of a deep breath. A distance so close she could hear
it.

*Closer.*

*Ah.*

Soft, warm, sweet….

She never knew such a blissful feeling existed in this world.
Intoxicated, she indulged in the sensation, accepting it completely.

And time passed.

Slowly, reluctantly, their lips parted.

When Letty hugged her tightly again, her hot breath tickled Ellie’s
earlobe.

"...My heart feels like it’s going to explode."

"...Mine too. ...Even though I don't have one."

As they spoke, they embraced each other again. As their chests pressed
together, she felt their heartbeats... *Our heartbeats?* A meaningless
question flashed through her mind for a second. But the comforting
warmth of the embrace quickly made it vanish.

How long did they feel each other's warmth and heartbeats? Slowly,
Letty's arms let go.

"And, well. I feel like I got the order wrong... but, will you accept
this?"

Saying that, Letty held out a long, slender box. Letty urged her on as
Ellie took it with trembling hands. Even though she felt like it was a
bit of a shame to open it, she slowly, slowly lifted the lid.

Inside was a pendant, with a delicate chain so fine it flowed softly
when she picked it up, and a vibrant blue gemstone at the end. The color
was a clear and unblemished blue that reminded her of the sky they had
traveled under.

And—

"It reminded me of the color of your eyes, Ellie. I wanted to give it to
you."

"...Do I really have eyes this color? This beautiful..."

"Yes. Honestly, they look even more beautiful. But I thought it would
suit you."

*That’s so unfair!* *What kind of face am I supposed to make at a time
like this?* Ellie felt like she was being swept away by her overflowing
emotions and didn't know what to do. But if Letty was going this far...

"Then, Letty-san... please put this on me. To see if it truly suits me."

"...Yes, of course."

Letty nodded, taking the pendant. She gently unfastened the clasp and
freed the chain, then reached around Ellie from the front. Again, they
were close. Incredibly so. Close enough for their breaths to mingle.
What tickled Ellie’s nose was a sweet scent. A familiar scent, but
somehow sweeter than usual.

Though her mind was adrift during the process, the skillful fingers soon
finished fastening the pendant around her neck. Its brilliance shone in
perfect harmony with Ellie's eyes.

"It suits you."

"You think so? Fufu, I'm happy to hear that."

They smiled at each other.

*Ah.*

*Surely this is what happiness feels like.*

That's what she thought.

"...Did you, by any chance, go off on your own earlier to…"

"Yes, I went to buy this. That merchant said he also dealt in jewelry. I
originally wanted to get a ring, but he said that’s something we should
choose together."

"A r-ring... Th-that, um, yes, I agree that might be better."

"So, when things settle down, we'll go choose a ring."

"Y-yes!"

*If Letty had actually picked out a ring, the heart I don’t have might
have stopped.* Thinking that, Ellie gently caressed the pendant. If this
color was what Letty saw, how beautiful must she look to her? She
couldn't help but break out into a blissful smile.

"Letty-san."

"Yes, what is it, Ellie?"

"Thank you, truly. I love you too, Letty-san. Let's stay together
forever."

"...Thank you."

And they hugged again. This time, it was a little looser, more gentle.
But the embrace felt even warmer than before.

Suddenly, Letty pressed onto Ellie. Almost like being pushed down.

"Ah, ah, Letty-san, all of a sudden! N-no, I mean, I'm totally fine with
it, but—"

"...Sorry, Ellie... I realized I finished saying what I wanted to say...
and now, suddenly, I'm sleepy... I used my head a lot today..."

"Eh, ah, Letty-san?” Ellie hastily caught Letty as her voice faded,
sounding like she was on the verge of falling asleep. “N-no, you can't,
you have to eat, you have to wipe yourself down! At least get into the
covers properly!"

The fact that Letty had been so focused was heartwarming, but she
couldn't help but feel that the mood was being ruined.

However, she couldn't bring herself to push her, so she reluctantly laid
Letty down on the bed and helped her change her clothes. ...Which, in
its own way, provided a certain indescribable joy.

After changing her clothes and tucking her into bed, she couldn't help
but glare at Letty with a slightly resentful look. Then, she gently took
off the pendant and carefully put it away. After changing her own
clothes, she snuck into her usual place, in Letty's arms.

And, as always, they slept together.

Not in a naughty way. Absolutely not. Probably. Maybe. Maybe not?

What would tomorrow bring?

"Can I look forward to it?"

She whispered to herself.

Feeling the warmth of her beloved, Ellie closed her eyes.

Feelings take form, become heat, and are engraved.

The morning after that first experience.

It’s the morning when everyday life suddenly takes on a fresh outlook.

Up Next: The Morning After It Came to Fruition

And so, a new day begins. She had a feeling.
