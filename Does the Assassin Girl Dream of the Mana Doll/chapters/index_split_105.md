## Chapter 128: Master and Apprentice Duet

The magistrate and his men, silenced in various ways, accepted
Dominique's proposal and quietly formed the procession. A hint of fear
was visible in the glances directed at the two women who had taken the
lead. And at Ellie, who interacted with them as an equal. All three
recipients ignored these gazes, however.

As the guards who had been there from the start tried to stifle their
laughter seeing the magistrate's demeanor, the caravan moved forward.
Despite a slight awkwardness, both sides were professionals. Somehow,
they maintained a minimum level of coordination and proceeded smoothly.

But when they were halfway to the capital—

"Dominique, enemies ahead. They are showing hostility towards us," Letty
warned.

"Oh, my, they actually came. How many?" Dominique responded with
nonchalance, but her eyes and posture were anything but. She looked
ahead sharply, yet with a hint of anticipation.

"Hmm... Strange formation. Three up front, and ten deployed behind
them."

"Oh? So, those three will charge in first to cause chaos, and the rest
will subdue us in the meantime then."

The three heading the charge must have been confident in their skill.
Even if they hadn't received information that five knights had joined
the entourage, they were attempting to charge head-on into a caravan
escorted by about ten guards.

"I can't be certain, but that's definitely the formation."

"Okay. Then, I'll let the boss and the magistrate know. Also, let's have
Ellie come up to the front."

Dominique signaled a nearby knight with her hand. When he approached,
she conveyed the situation and sent him as a messenger to the three
people in the center. She then turned back to the front and raised an
eyebrow.

"I see. They're a decent bunch, those guys."

"...Yes, quite formidable."

Dominique noticed first, followed by Letty.

Although they were disguising the way they held themselves, feigning
travelers, their demeanor and gait were those of seasoned veterans.
Unfortunately, the guards, and even the knights and the magistrate,
would likely be no match. At least, the two of them agreed on that much.

"When they get a bit closer, dismount."

"Yes, it would be too difficult to fight on horseback."

They exchanged strategy in low voices, without stopping, carefully
observing the front and surrounding area. It seemed there were no
ambushes other than the ten men deployed in the rear.

Just then, Ellie, who had been called, arrived.

"Dominique-san, did you call for me?"

"Ah, Ellie, it looks like you'll have a role to play. Wait a little
behind us."

"Yes, I understand."

Ellie nodded obediently to Dominique's instruction and positioned
herself slightly behind them.

After advancing a little further, Dominique gave a slight hand signal.
Letty and Ellie dismounted, and the carriages slowed down, eventually
stopping. They saw the opponents, realizing they had been spotted,
quicken their pace.

"Well, well. Having made such a grand promise, I can't afford to mess
up."

Though she spoke without a hint of tension, Dominique still showed no
complacency, as she too dismounted from the carriage and moved further
forward. Letty walked beside her, frowning slightly.

"I wonder about saying things like that when you have no intention of
messing up."

"No, no, I'm thinking there's always a slim chance, you know? Even I can
misjudge things sometimes."

A light laugh rang out.

Perhaps hearing her voice or seeing her expression, the men approaching
briefly looked grim before their expressions returned to normal. *Still
not good enough,* Dominique muttered, the corner of her lips twitching
up. The distance between them was now less than ten meters, close enough
for immediate engagement.

Suddenly, Dominique opened her mouth.

"Now, gentlemen. This is a busy road… Isn't it rude to block the passage
of a carriage?"

"..."

They didn’t reply but instead put their hands on their swords.

"Good grief, no questions asked, huh? ...Alright, Egret. You take two,
and I'll take one."

"Wait, shouldn't it be the other way around? Well, whatever..."

They spoke with the premise that they would naturally defeat their
opponents. Hearing this, the men raised their eyebrows and drew their
swords. Letty and Dominique reached for their hilts in response. Then,
without touching her hilt, Dominique instead clapped her hands together
loudly.

*BANG!* The sound was like an explosion, instantly drawing the men’s
attention.

In less than a second's difference, the man on the far right collapsed.

"What?!"

With a small cry, the remaining two leaped back. Even before they could
grasp what had happened, they instinctively sought distance from the
place where *something* had happened. Their movements were deeply
ingrained, knowing that not stopping was paramount.

And as they retreated, they realized: In that fleeting moment of
distraction, the black-haired woman had rushed in, drawing her sword to
strike, and their comrade had been cleaved across the forehead.

Caught off guard by the unexpected development, the ten men in the rear
were paralyzed, and the two who had pushed forward were left unable to
retreat. If they turned their backs, they would surely be instantly cut
down. They recognized that the two in front of them possessed that level
of skill.

Disregarding their inner turmoil, the two women approached them with
movements that appeared casual. Yes, in *appearance* only. Their backs
were perfectly straight, their steps unforced, their balance unwavering.
With a sharpened gait, they advanced towards the men. One was
expressionless, the other wore a fearless smile.

"Now, that makes it two pairs of one-on-one. The handicap's gone, so
this is fair, right?" Dominique drew her sword while speaking in a
teasing tone.

Of course, the men were not so inexperienced as to fall for such a
provocation, but they couldn't hide their grim expressions. The
remaining two, no longer concealing their killing intent, confronted
them: the man on the right against Letty, and the man on the left
against Dominique.

Then, Letty stepped forward again and attacked the man facing her. This
time, the strike aimed at the forehead just like before was quickly
reacted to and parried. By the time he tried to counterattack, Letty had
already flowed to the right as if sliding, attempting to circle to his
left.

He immediately tried to track her with his eyes; as he turned to face
her and prepared for the next move—

"Gah!"

He was suddenly struck on the back of the head, and with a short yelp,
he collapsed and fell unconscious. Dominique had moved to his side
without him noticing. At the moment the man turned his back to
Dominique, lured by Letty's movement, Dominique had struck him with the
flat of her sword as if she had been waiting for the opportunity.

Glancing down to confirm he was unconscious, Dominique re-posed her
sword towards the single remaining opponent. Unable to keep up with the
movements, the last of the three opponents still standing instinctively
took a step back, overwhelmed by the blade pointed at him.

"Y-you bastard! How cowardly! You said it was one-on-one!"

To his bitter, resentful words, she offered an absolutely delighted,
malicious smile.

"Ah, I'm a liar. My bad."

"What?! You say that so shamelessly! Don't get in the way!"

As the man, enraged by Dominique’s unrepentant words, was about to
launch his attack, Letty lunged at him from the side. However, the man
parried the shortsword's strike and counterattacked. She evaded.

Just as he was about to pursue, hoping to at least take down the woman
in front of him—

His knees buckled.

Faster than he could process that his knees had been cut, the impact on
the back of his head reaped his consciousness.

"My apologies again. My saying that she would take two and I would take
one was about the number of decoys." She apologized, but with a look
that showed she wasn’t sorry in the slightest.

"...I now fully understand the meaning of ‘insincerity’," Letty
muttered.

Dominique shrugged lightly in reply before looking towards the remaining
rearguard. The men who had just lost their comrades had begun their
charge, as if to take revenge.

"Oho, how devoted. Ellie, it's your turn!"

"Ah, yes, understood!"

Ellie, who had been watching the situation with an expression that
clearly said, *Oh, as expected,* hurried closer at Dominique's summons.

And a few seconds later, a white flash of light dyed the midday plains.

When a surface is touched, waves rise and ripples spread.

Ripples call forth ripples, touching, spreading, overlapping.

Shaking and being shaken, changing and being changed, connecting to the
next.

Up Next: Undulation

No one yet knows the future that lies beyond.
