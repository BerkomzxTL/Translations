## Chapter 118: The Morning After It Came to Fruition

Today, too, Letty woke up before the sun rose.

When she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was Ellie's face right
next to hers. It felt a little distant, which was dissatisfying. She
wiggled her body and face closer, careful not to wake her. They were in
their usual hugging posture, and just for good measure, she intertwined
their legs. She gazed at her, feeling a ticklish warmth where they
touched.

They were close enough to feel each other's breath, which was ticklish
but made her happy nevertheless. But last night, they had been even
closer. Close enough to directly drink in each other's breath. Just
remembering that made her face flush. No, it made the depths of her body
feel hot.

She felt from the bottom of her heart that it was a very happy thing.

The same distance as always. ...Though maybe a little closer than usual.
A distance that felt different from usual. She wanted to get closer, but
she knew forcing it was wrong. Ellie would probably accept it, but
perhaps it was her own stubbornness that made her think that's precisely
why she shouldn't.

But.

She wanted to cherish her. The softness of her body that she felt as
they hugged. Fluffy and plump in places. With a fragility that felt like
she might break if she were too rough.

But.

She also wanted to touch her. As they hugged like this, she wanted more,
and more. To touch her soft lips, or perhaps places that might be even
softer. She wanted to be a little rough, almost to the point of breaking
her.

"No, no... What am I thinking..." She muttered under her breath.

Last night, something within her was definitely satisfied. Definitely,
without a doubt, satisfied.

And yet, now that she was awake, there was a part of her that wanted
more. She never imagined she was this greedy.

"...It's all your fault, Ellie..." She vented softly.

She knew. She knew it was directionless frustration. That Ellie was not
at fault. Yet, the difference in her life before and after meeting her
was so dramatic that the words came out almost unbidden.

Not only her relationships, but most of all, she herself had been
transformed. She had felt fun. She had felt joy. She had felt sadness.
She had been lost to anger. She had thought things were beautiful. She
had thought things were vibrant.

For the first time, she had realized how beautiful the world was.

And all of it happened after she met Ellie. She even felt that Ellie had
given it all to her.

"...Hey, have I given you anything...?"

It was precisely because she was grateful from the bottom of her heart
that she worried about whether she was worthy of these emotions. She had
given her the pendant. She had spoken her honest feelings as clearly as
she could. She believed without a doubt that Ellie was genuinely happy.
...Yet, she still felt that she was nowhere near matching what she had
received.

"I want to give you more, you know," she murmured.

*Hah*, a sigh.

She inhaled. Exhaled. Inhaled. Just the act of breathing filled her
chest with a sweet, melting scent. The scent of her beloved Ellie.

Even by just breathing like this, she was once again receiving something
from her. How was she supposed to return it?

"I wish Ellie would ask for more, too," she grumbled.

Ellie had been the one to ask to sleep together. Ellie was usually the
one to initiate the hugs.

These were already distant memories.

She had been the one to initiate the kiss. That had eclipsed everything
else.

To Letty, she was the one who had asked for it. That's why she found the
current situation frustrating. She wanted to give. She wanted to be
asked.

These feelings swirled and churned in her chest.

"I'm willing to give you anything, you know..."

*I can probably guess what Ellie wants…* Yes, that’s what she believed.
But then, a certain thought came to mind, and her face suddenly flushed.

She knew about *it* in theory, of course. It had crossed her mind
fleetingly when she saw Ellie as they wiped their bodies down with hot
water.

The moment she consciously thought about it, she realized. Wasn't she,
herself, the one who desired it?

"No, no, that's... that's... But it’s supposed to be normal for
couples..."

So what about them? Although they were two women, they had made a vow
that was equivalent to marriage.

"It's not out of the question, is it...?" She whispered.

So, so softly, so no one could hear.

If someone heard her, she would surely die of embarrassment. Her face
was already burning up as she pondered seriously.

"Honestly... it's all Ellie's fault..."

Her own confusion. Her increasing desire for more. It was all because of
Ellie. That's why she vented that way.

As Letty mulled over her feelings, mixed with frustration, the view
outside the window began to brighten.

"Morning... I have to wake Ellie up."

She didn't want to wake her. She wished morning would never come. She
wished they could stay like this forever.

But morning arrived nonetheless.

A single sigh.

"Ellie, wake up. It's almost time."

"Mmm... *Aah*... Ah, Letty-san... good morning..."

*Cute.* Before she could think, she was already hugging her.

"B-Bweh, ah, L-Letty-san!?"

"Sorry... you're just too cute, Ellie, I couldn't help it..."

"Eh, no, wait, that! Stop saying things like that... that's what I mean
about you, you flirt..."

Sullen and embarrassed.

Ellie's smile, tinged with unconcealable happiness, felt like a vice
squeezing her heart.

"But it's the truth,” she muttered, leaning her face closer. “Should I
prove it right now?"

The meaning must have been crystal clear, as Ellie turned her deepest
shade of red yet. She froze for a moment. Then, slowly, she let the
tension leave her body.

"Y-yes... please prove it..."

Ellie closed her eyes.

And Letty proved it.

Over and over.

They pressed their lips together again and again until their breathing
grew ragged.

It was only the faint, lingering sense of professional duty that stopped
them just short of being late.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new days that began seemed unremarkable.

Like a storm sweeping through, people get tossed around.

The wind blowing across the plains carries the scent of blood.

Up Next: An Unsettling Wind

Is the situation about to take a dramatic turn?
