## Chapter 130: The Capital of the Plains

And then, the group finally reached the royal capital of Cordor. There
were thankfully no further incidents.

"So this is Cordor's capital, Cordoria... I'd heard stories, but the
castle walls really aren't that high, are they?" Letty muttered in front
of the castle gate. Indeed, while it had the form of a fortified city,
the walls looked about half the height of the royal capitals of Valandia
and Jurastin.

The magistrate must have overheard her, as he rode his horse closer.
"Certainly so, compared to Valandia and others.” Rather than offended,
he seemed somewhat amused. “Do you think it looks poor?"

Letty studied his face for a moment, then slowly shook her head. "The
defensive philosophy seems different. Since there are many gates, I
wonder if they prioritize a sally-out and engagement on the plains. And
that width... it's like the space between the gate and the royal castle
is to act as an outer moat…

“Perhaps, if an invasion occurs, they plan to use their knowledge of the
urban terrain for a counter-attack, and residents are prepared to
evacuate immediately if necessary...?"

The sense of displacement from the visible scenery at the gate, and the
contrast between the castle's imposing structure and the low walls…. The
cityscape and the sense of distance were distinctly foreign. The low
density and complex layout of the streets seemed like a kind of trap in
itself.

Hearing her observations, the magistrate's eyes widened, and he was
rendered speechless. After a moment, he opened his mouth while smiling
wryly. "I am astonished. There are few who can deduce that much. Were
you educated as a knight?"

"No, nothing like that, but... perhaps I've received a little more
education than the average person." Letty tilted her head, the question
leaving her confused.

In truth, she had not received a knight's education and even lacked
proper etiquette training. She had simply been educated on things that
were practical in various senses, but she couldn't possibly say that.

That attitude, however, seemed to have been interpreted as modesty. The
magistrate nodded, looking satisfied. "Then you must have studied very
well. Your knowledge is a fortune; cherish it."

"Ah, um, well... thank you." She nodded vaguely as the comment deepened
her confusion. If he said so, it must be true. However, that ‘fortune’
had been established by a certain villain. But she couldn't possibly
mention it, and she was now capable of reading the atmosphere at least
to that extent.

"Indeed, sometimes being honest is important when one is young. The fact
that a young lady such as yourself has formed a connection with Princess
Tseren may be considered a stroke of luck."

"...I think that's going too far, honestly..."

Letty's quiet protest did not reach the magistrate.

\*\*\*

Various misunderstandings and misinterpretations aside, the caravan
continued into the royal capital. From there, the group split again into
those heading to the guild's warehouse and those escorting Tseren.

Naturally, Letty, Ellie, and Dominique were on the escort side.

"Oh, the Princess has returned!"

"Welcome back, Princess Tseren!"

"Princess—welcome back!"

As they proceeded down the main street, the people’s voices rang out.
Tseren dutifully greeted each of them in return. Since both sides were
accustomed to this, there was no problem with a large crowd preventing
them from moving forward.

"...It's a strange sight, isn't it?"

"Certainly, I never saw anything like it in Jurastin."

Letty and Ellie, following behind Tseren and the surrounding knights,
exchanged such comments.

In Jurastin, it was rare for members of the royal family, let alone
noble women, to travel on horseback. They usually rode in carriages, and
their faces were never shown to the public. Furthermore, commoners
wouldn’t dare to call out to them so casually. The royal personages
Ellie knew were much the same. It was unreasonable to expect affection
from people one had never seen or heard, and that was the norm.

But the norm did not apply in this country.

"She doesn't seem very princess-like, yet she is. It's a contradiction,
but..."

"Ah, I kind of understand. Like, she's loved by everyone. It almost
feels like a fairy tale..."

Yes, it seemed like a story from another world. They realized how much
things could change depending on the country and its people.

"...I've been reminded again of how much I don't know."

"It’s embarrassing, but I'm also feeling that acutely..."

Swallowing the two women's murmurs, the group proceeded. Soon they
arrived at the main gate of the royal castle. The magistrate said
something to the gate guard, and one of the guards rushed inside. After
a short time, the guard returned and spoke with the magistrate, and then
the knights and Tseren entered the castle.

Once they left, Dominique stretched dramatically. "Well, I suppose this
means we’re no longer needed."

"Ah, you were a great help indeed, thank you." The magistrate, who had
not yet entered, called out to them.

“Oh?” Dominique looked at him with a puzzled expression. "No, no, it was
just our job. I wouldn't say we didn't do much... that would be a lie."

The magistrate didn’t reprimand her for her flippancy. Instead, he
smiled and nodded. "Ah, you certainly did great things. Rather, you were
incredible. His Majesty will likely have words for you regarding your
service. You might be summoned tomorrow, so I'd like you to stay
somewhere we can contact you for a while."

"Heh, really? Well, that's more than we could ask for. Ah, I suppose the
matter concerning the incident will also need to be discussed, right?"

"Yes, that is part of it."

That is, the attempted kidnapping of Tseren by Gaschnar. Since this
matter could affect future diplomatic relations, the more witnesses, the
better. Especially witnesses who had earned the trust of the magistrate.

"Then, we'll be staying at an inn where the boss has connections. You
can contact us through the merchant guild if anything happens."

"Ah, I understand."

The two wrapped up their exchange and parted ways for the time being.

After walking away for a bit, Dominique turned to Letty and Ellie. "Oh,
even though I said an inn where we have connections, we’ll have separate
rooms, or actually I’ll even stay at a different inn if you want, so
don't worry."

"...You don't need to say unnecessary things..." Letty replied curtly.

She had been called out on something that had been dwelling in the
corner of her mind, so she averted her eyes as she spoke.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They accomplished what they needed to do and delivered what they needed
to deliver.

They had earned a moment of rest.

While they did not know what tomorrow would bring, they would take
comfort in this night.

Up Next: A Moment of Respite

Whether mind and body will truly be at peace.
