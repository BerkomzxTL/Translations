## Chapter 104.5: Does the Mana Doll Dream of the Assassin Girl? \[R18+\]

It was the usual.

As always, they slipped into one bed together. Cuddling, playing,
teasing. Truly, the usual. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Or so it should have been.

Today, she was hugging her a little tighter than usual. She was rubbing
her body against her with a little more fervor. It was just a slight
difference. Yet it sparked a fire inside her.

It seemed she wasn't the only one.

"...Ellie..." Letty stared at her, her face close.

Her cheeks were flushed. Her normally cool eyes were hot and moist; her
expression languid. Her slightly thin, sharp lips were parted just a
little, and the glistening wetness gave her an indescribably sensual
charm.

Before she could even think, Letty mounted her. Realizing she was being
looked down upon, the gaze and the weight on her hips sent a heat
rippling through her core.

"Letty-san..." She could only call her name in response.

Even that came out as barely a whisper, her throat constricted.
Something swelling deep inside her body was choking her.

...It was hot. But it felt so good.

Overwhelmed by the heat rising from the depths of her body, she reached
out her arms as she felt Letty rub her cheek against hers. Then Letty's
face moved down, tracing her arm, and she pressed herself against her.

A tight squeeze.

Hugging her so hard her ribs felt like they might break. With arms
wrapped around her back and pressing down from above, a satisfied sigh
escaped her lips. Even this sensation of being pressed down upon was
precious.

After enjoying that comfort for a while, she felt it lighten slightly.
Puzzled, Ellie looked up and saw the face of her cherished beloved. It
was an expression she hadn’t seen before; an unconcealable look of
desperate passion. Almost pained.

So, Ellie smiled and closed her eyes in acceptance.

After a moment's hesitation, as if a dam had broken, a pair of lips
forcefully pressed against her own. It was a clumsy, youthful,
demanding, and slightly selfish kiss. But coming from Letty, who rarely
ever asked for anything herself, she felt nothing but joy seeing that
she was so desired. So much so that Ellie unconsciously tightened her
embrace

*Mmnph*, a sweet sound escaped. From who? They desired and devoured each
other so much that she couldn't tell. The simple act of pressing lips
together. She never knew it could be so sensual, so stimulating, so
lovely. It was something she was learning for the first time.

...She was glad the person making her feel these emotions for the first
time was *her*. From the bottom of her heart.

How long did they mindlessly devour each other? As their lips separated
for a moment, a hot breath escaped and sweetly tickled her nose.

*Gulp*, someone swallowed nervously.

*Chup,* the sound of something wet.

And then, the moist, sensual touch of a wet membrane made contact with
her lips.

Her body trembled for a moment, but she understood what it meant from
her knowledge. As she gently parted her lips, a hesitant, reserved
tongue slid inside.

At first, it traced the area around her lips. Little by little, it
explored inward. Asking for more, it ventured deeper.

*Twitch, twitch.* With every advance, a jolt of heat throbbed deep
within her body. She desired a deeper connection. And so she, too,
gently offered her tongue.

The instant they connected, both of their bodies jumped. It felt funny,
and at the same time delightful. Above all, she wanted more.

They touched again. This time, their tongues firmly intertwined.

*Slurp, smack*. A sticky wetness leaked from between their lips. The
obscene sound fanned the heat in their bodies as their tongues’ dance
intensified.

Obeying gravity, their saliva mixed, thickened, and flowed down. When
she gulped and swallowed, the sweetness caused a shiver to run through
her body. A sweet throb of desire in her lower abdomen. Just that was
enough for her to realize she was already completely hot and moist.

*Squirm.* Which one of them unconsciously moved their hips first? They
writhed against each other, and the simple contact sent sweet throbs
through her body.

She wanted to stay like this. And yet she wanted a more intimate touch.

*Does Letty want me?* Letty's face, as she slowly withdrew her lips,
looked even more pained and wistful. Her hot, moist eyes and lips wet
with stray strands of saliva were utterly sensual. The sight alone sent
shivers down her spine.

"Ellie... please, it's okay, right...? You'll say it's okay, won't
you...?"

"Please, don't ask me that... I belong to you... Do what you like... I
*want* you to..."

*Ah, she’s definitely my master.*

She wanted to be pinned down. She wanted to be devoured as much as she
wanted. She wanted to be completely ravaged until she broke.

Only such indecent desires floated through her mind. Of course, she
couldn't voice them. All she could do was open her arms in acceptance
and offer a smile.

Seeing that, Letty swallowed hard.

And after a moment's pause—

"...Ellie!!"

She lunged forward and aggressively took Ellie's lips.

Her body trembled with delight under the painfully tight embrace. And
she was slightly disappointed when it slackened. However, when the
neckline of her nightwear was fumbled open, her chest swelled with
anticipation.

Unimaginably, Letty’s usually skillful fingers were now trembling and
unsteady. Her desperation was conveyed, and it made Ellie’s heart melt.
She even felt proud that she was being desired this much.

As her chest was exposed, cool air flowed in. To her hot body, even that
transmitted as pleasure. And the growing anticipation generated even
more heat.

The front of her nightwear was completely opened, exposing her ample
breasts that still asserted their volume even while lying down. Her
heartbeat quickened as her body begged to be touched, and to be touched
quickly.

And then, the hesitant fingertips that made contact. Even such a
tentative touch, so characteristic of her, left her in bliss and in
realization once again of how smitten she was with her master.

Above all, she had been *touched* by her. Just that alone was almost
enough to make her climax; a clear sign of how far gone she was. ...No,
maybe she had already lightly climaxed. She could feel her lower abdomen
convulsing with pleasure.

And then, to have that spot touched so gently, so softly, so tenderly...

"Uwah! Ah, noo, Letty-saaan! D-Don't... If you're that gentle with
me..."

"A-ah, I'm sorry, I don't really know... um, should I press more?"

And on the cusp of another orgasm, Letty, having misunderstood, pinched
the tip hard.

"Hiiyaaahh!! A-ah, n-noo... don't, don't pinch it!"

"Eh, it's n-no good...? Then, then like this...?"

"Hik!? Hiyaah! Th-that's not it! It's not no good, it's...!"

As the sudden stimulation made her climax, she let out a scream-like
moan. Flustered, Letty released her fingers and instead began to gently
massage the hardened nipple with the flat of her finger. The further
stimulation right after such a strong orgasm made her body jump again.

"Eh... It's not no good...? It's fine?"

"It's fine, b-but! It's too good! Ah, no, no! Stop, be gentler!" She
tried to string words together, but her tongue could barely articulate.

The moment she said "too good," Letty grabbed both breasts in both
hands. Her middle fingers, catching the tips, seemed to press and crush
them, then loosen and roll them in a circular motion. While doing that,
her hands continued to grip her breasts, kneading and deforming them.

The sensation, which would normally be painful, instead created a sinful
pleasure that incited a masochistic urge. Unconsciously, she pushed her
chest out as if offering it.

"...Are you really saying no...? You don't look like it..."

"No, I am! Ah, stop that! Stop, not that! Don't play with my breasts!
I'll be ruined! I'll break!!"

She was being toyed with. She was being manipulated. …And it brought her
pleasure. She knew it, but she didn't want to admit it. She wanted more.
Her words of refusal had a sweet, inviting ring to them.

And that ignited something within Letty. She concentrated on her
fingers, relentlessly fondling her sensitive breasts. Gradually, she
increased the size of her movements, feeling for the exact limit where
it didn't hurt, but the pleasure was strongest. It felt like an
experiment, or like playing around. But Letty herself was utterly
serious.

And for the person being subjected to it...

"Hyaa! Ah, stop, nooo! I'm going to cum! I'm going to cum! St-stop,
nooo! I'm ruined! I'm ruined! Ah-fuhn!! Stop, I came, I came! I'm going
to cum again!"

She was exposed to one strong stimulus after another. She orgasmed, and
without a break the next stimulus arrived. ...She kept saying no, but
her body was accepting it.

"Ellie... you're so cute... Can you make more cute noises for me...?"

"You-you idiot, Letty-san, nngh! You idiot! A-Ah, no! T-That side,
hiyaa!"

As Letty's right hand left her breast, the stimulation subsided
slightly. A momentary reprieve. The next moment, she began to tremble as
that hand started to smoothly slide towards her lower body.

If she were to be touched there now... She’d be exposed. Maybe she had
already been exposed, but it would be confirmed.

She tried to move her hips to escape, but her body refused to obey. And
it was easily discovered.

"...Ellie, I haven't even touched you yet, but you're already...
soaking..."

"D-don't say that! Ah, hik! Stop, stop! If you touch me now, I'll,
I'll...!"

"...No. I'm going to touch you. Because I want to."

The heated voice was both unfamiliar and yet unmistakably Letty's. For
some reason, that excited her intensely.

Then, she was touched there. The most sensitive nub at the top of her
hot spring that was overflowing with lustful nectar.

"N-No, noooo!! Aaaahhh!!"

She was touched.

That alone made her climax spectacularly.

*Thump! Thump!* Her body convulsed, refusing to obey her, as if it
wasn't her own. Yet, it poured pleasure into her relentlessly. Her body
had been made so wanton by Letty's fingers.

...It felt both shameful... and joyful. The sounds of her pleasure were
overflowing and impossible to hide.

"Honestly... saying no, and yet getting so much pleasure out of it...
Ellie, you're a liar..."

"Hwa... yes... I’m a liar... A lying girl who says no, even though she's
feeling so much pleasure..."

Somehow, those words slipped out. And being made to say them created a
sense of shame so intense it made her body tremble.

"Yes, Ellie is a bad, lying girl... Bad girls must be punished...
right?"

And then—

*Squelch.* Her hot spring was penetrated by Letty's long, slender
finger.

"Mmmnnn\~\~\~!! Ah, hiyaah!! A-aah!! I'm a bad girl!! So, please punish
me more, and more!! Ahn, more, more!"

"Asking for it makes you a bad girl... A girl like you deserves
punishment..."

*Squelch, shulp, shulp.* Obscene watery sounds echoed as her insides
were stirred. She had completely melted, becoming so sensitive that she
came multiple times simply from the thrusting motion of Letty’s finger.

"Ahhhn!! Please, more, more! H-hik, it's coming, something’s cominggg!"

Her body trembled at the premonition of an enormous wave of pleasure,
incomparably greater than the many that had already crashed over her. It
was, of course, a tremor of joy. She opened her legs wide and thrust her
hips to welcome it. Begging for more, and more. To receive it as deeply
as possible.

"Yes... Naughty Ellie, go ahead and cum!"

"Ahn, I'm cumming! I’m cummingg! Ahhn, ah aah!! Aaaahhhhh!!"

Ecstasy that threatened to consume her, overwhelming her limits. Her
body shook with spasms and her walls contracted tightly. The intense
sensation dyed Ellie's brain pure white.

\*\*\*

"...Bwuh!?"

Suddenly, Ellie jolted awake, her eyes wide open. Her breathing was
ragged and her body was flushed.

But—

"A-Ah, what? I... Eh? What?"

Her nightwear was slightly rumpled, but properly closed. More
importantly, Letty was lying right next to her, as always. ...The only
proof of what had happened was the cold, wet area between her legs.

"Eh... C-could it be... a dream...?"

She was left stunned once the understanding hit her that it seemed to be
a dream. *Of all things, what kind of dream was that?* Just as she was
reeling from the realization,

"Mmm... Ellie? What's wrong...?"

"Ah, Le-Letty-san!? N-nothing, it's nothing!"

Unfortunately, Letty woke up, causing Ellie to frantically try and cover
it up. Since Letty wasn't fully awake, there was no further inquiry.

"Is that so... Then it's fine..." She said in a somewhat hazy tone.

Suddenly, she sniffed, as if smelling something. The gesture made Ellie
jump.

"It smells... nice... Ellie's scent..."

"Fweh!? I-is that right...?"

"Yes, it's very... what is it... this..."

Saying that, Letty hugged Ellie tightly. In that position, with their
legs intertwined, Letty's thigh slipped between Ellie's legs, making her
tremble.

"It's not morning yet... good night..."

"A-ah, yes, good night..."

As her words suggested, Letty's breathing soon steadied as she fell back
asleep. Ellie felt relieved, only to immediately take it back. Just a
slight shift and Letty's thigh would brush against her still sensitive
area. It was an intensely shameful, yet dangerously tempting invitation.

*Should I just go for it?* But if she got caught...

She was tormented by the conflict.

"W-will I be like this, in this state of torture, until morning...?" A
despairing murmur escaped her lips.

Her fears became reality as Ellie spent the rest of the night tossing
and turning in agony until dawn.

This is a commemorative short story the author wrote in celebration of
