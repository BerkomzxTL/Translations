## Chapter 133: Change of Place

Despite some mild turbulence, the outfits and makeup were ready by the
time they headed to the castle. Nevertheless, Ellie seemed slightly
dissatisfied with the rushed nature of the preparations, particularly
regarding Letty's attire.

"Although they managed to find good clothes, I feel like there could
have been other options to enhance Letty-san's charm..."

"Ellie, calm down. I'm more than satisfied with this..." Letty soothed
her while plucking at the clothing she wore.

It was a thick fabric, probably winter-weight, short tunic coupled with
trousers that covered her down to her ankles. Both were predominantly
blue in a muted color, adorned with subtle yet skillful embroidery,
making the garments recognizable to anyone who knew fashion as being of
truly fine tailoring.

Ellie, on the other hand, wore a white-based dress overlaid with a
vibrant green jacket, cinched at the waist with a decorative belt. This,
too, had delicate embroidery on the cuffs and hem, creating a refined
impression.

Despite being hastily prepared, both women looked perfectly presentable
and elegant, yet Ellie was still not satisfied. "But, but, I just feel
like there could have been something more..."

"Stop troubling Rudolf. Besides..." Letty suddenly leaned closer to
Ellie and whispered into her ear. "I want only Ellie to see me in
outfits like that..."

Ellie froze instantly.

And after a moment of silence.

"Oh, really, Letty-san, saying things like that again! You can't do that
in public, honestly!" Her cheeks flushed, Ellie playfully slapped
Letty's arm, but her reaction was clearly delighted. Accepting the light
chastisement, Letty looked relieved.

Dominique, watching their exchange, shrugged lightly before speaking in
her typically teasing tone. "Egret, you're a naughty woman, you know."

"Stop it. I've been worrying about that myself lately, so please
stop..." She replied quietly, averting her gaze.

After some minor adjustments, the scheduled time arrived, and they
headed to the castle in the merchant guild's carriages. Since all the
escorts were invited, the number of carriages drew considerable
attention. It was easy to imagine that fielding so many carriages would
incur a substantial cost.

*"This is also part of the promotion,"* Rudolf had said, but it was hard
to tell how much was business acumen and how much was genuine goodwill.
He had certainly earned the trust of the guild master.

In any case, they arrived at the castle. The gate guards, having been
informed of their arrival ahead of time, allowed the carriages through
after a simple verification.

They were shown to a waiting room for a short while. Eventually, they
were summoned and led into the throne room. Following the custom of
Valandia and other nations, they knelt and waited with bowed heads.

"His Majesty Batbayar Dulguun Cordor has arrived. All be silent!"

A solemn-voiced man, likely a noble, announced, causing everyone to
straighten their posture.

After a moment, the doors opened. A middle-aged man, followed by Tseren,
entered, accompanied by attendants. He wore a magnificent beard, and his
robust, muscular figure seemed more suited to that of a general, yet he
boldly took the seat on the throne. There was no doubt that this man was
the king.

"Hmm, everyone, raise your heads. I am Batbayar Dulguun Cordor.” The
King's voice was filled with a regal authority.

Initially, at least.

“And, I mean, you are my daughter's saviors, so don't be so stiff.”

But it instantly crumbled as he spoke with the easygoing manner of an
uncle.

“No, wait, I apologize. I suppose it can't be helped for guests from
Valandia; things are so rigid over there."

…Only to quickly regain his composure with the expression of a sensible
adult who could read the situation.

This frantic, one-man performance unfolded in just a few seconds. Letty
and Ellie, along with the rest of the Valandian party, who had raised
their heads as instructed, could only stare blankly. Only Dominique and
Rudolf, who seemed to have been aware of this tendency, maintained their
smiling expressions.

"Ah, you all aren't very familiar with Cordor, are you? Well, then, it's
natural for you to have such looks."

Perhaps noticing Letty and Ellie, King Batbayar spoke to them quite
casually. Next to him, Tseren was smiling wryly.

"By the way, which of you are Dominique and Egret? Tseren spoke very
enthusiastically about you two. I wanted to meet you once and see your
faces..." He spoke, looking around the gathering with cheerful, yet
appraising eyes.

As they wondered if they should announce themselves, Rudolf spoke up,
"Pardon me, Your Majesty. This woman is Dominique-san, and this woman is
Egret-san."

"Oh? Well, no, apologies for the rude remark, but I thought my tomboy
daughter who spends all her time riding horses had finally taken an
interest in men, but you’re both women, hm..."

After expressing his disappointment, Batbayar observed the two women.
His gaze lingered thoughtfully on Dominique's face.

"Say, while I'm being rude, at your age, with that name, and that
skill... Could you possibly be the Whirlwind Lady?"

"Oh my, I'm surprised someone still remembers that name. I was indeed
called that once before."

As she replied calmly, Batbayar leaned forward excitedly and spoke
loudly.

"Seriously?! It's an honor to meet the only female champion of the
Swordsmanship Tournament! And to be Tseren's savior—we must drink! Hey,
start the banquet! Prepare the feast! Ah, you, you can hold your liquor,
can't you? I can tell just by looking at your face."

"Yes, of course. I'd be delighted to accompany you."

Dominique grinned in response to the overjoyed Batbayar.

"...Are we also included?"

Letty glanced at Ellie, her expression full of confusion.

When liquor flows, scarlet flowers bloom, and hearts and mouths become
light.

Let the worries spilled from loose lips dissolve in the aroma of
alcohol.

Though the country may change, she will entrust herself to that which
remains unwavering.
