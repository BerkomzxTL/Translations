## Chapter 156: Sword Dance—Start

After that, the second and third preliminary rounds continued with a
time gap in between, but the audience didn't seem to be getting excited.
Well, it was perhaps unavoidable after being shown such a shocking
spectacle.

Regardless, the preliminaries progressed.

"Come on, Egret, you should head to the assembly area soon."

"Ah, right."

After being prompted, Letty stood up. Now that the moment had truly
arrived... her chest fluttered slightly.

"Well, just do what you always do. First, watch your opponent properly.
With the way you are now, that alone should tell you what you need to
do."

"...Is that how it works?"

She tilted her head. Well, worrying about it wouldn't give her the
answer anyway. The answer could only be found inside the arena.

"That's right, Egret-sama will definitely succeed!"

"If Big Sis and Tseren say so, then it must be true, I guess."

Compared to Tseren's enthusiasm, Batbayar, who hadn't actually seen
Letty in action, remained composed. Although he couldn’t be called
skeptical, it was understandable that he couldn't fully believe it
either.

And then.

"Letty-san, I'll be watching your cool performance from here."

She heard the voice of Ellie; she who believed in Letty more than
anyone. Hearing that, she felt something settle firmly in her chest.

*I think I'll be fine.*

Strangely, she felt that way naturally.

"Yes, watch closely."

She offered a small smile and headed out of the viewing area.

\*\*\*

They gathered at the assembly area, answered the roll call, and
underwent an inspection to check for any magical enhancements.
Contestants cleared of any issues then proceeded into the arena.

Letty cleared the inspection without problem. The moment she appeared
through the gate, a murmur arose. Though she walked toward the arena
without seeming to notice, with every step, the murmuring grew louder.
She stopped near the center. The commotion didn't cease, and the gaze of
the audience, and the eyes of the contestants who had already entered,
were fixed on her.

Letty was the only female participant in the tournament. In fact, there
hadn't been a female participant for several decades. Furthermore, while
almost everyone else was clad in full metal armor, she wore only her
usual leather breastplate. It was understandable that she drew so much
attention.

Yet, Letty paid no mind.

She took a deep breath and looked up at the clear sky above. A few
clouds drifted across. For some reason, the slightest movement of those
clouds was clearly visible to her.

She let out a slow exhale, drawing her focus back to the arena. She was
being watched. Several people were looking at her. Even as she felt
this, her mind was strangely calm.

More and more contestants entered the arena. Every single one of them
looked at Letty more than once. And then, they drifted to the edges. As
if to surround her, who stood in the center.

"...I see. It's surprisingly clear to me."

She murmured softly. Or perhaps, she was simply calm.

Everyone seemed to have entered, and an official came in to announce the
start:

"Draw your swords!!"

With that, everyone drew their weapons. The arena filled with killing
intent, and the tension soared. All except for Letty.

"Begin!!!"

With the starting signal, contestants simultaneously leaped toward their
respective targets.

"Let's take out the woman first!"

"Hehe, you thought the same?"

Accompanying such vulgar voices, several men charged at Letty. Although
this wasn't supposed to be a team battle, and there should have been no
prior connection between them, this was a sight occasionally seen in a
battle royale format.

"...I see."

There were five men heading towards her. Their movements were not
particularly impressive compared to Dominique or Curtis. And as she
watched them, she somehow felt she could see what they intended to do.

They approached.

One step, two steps, three steps… *Now.*

The moment the man leading the pack entered her range, she leaped in
front of him in an instant.

"W-Whoa!?"

Just as he stopped in a panic, and those following him were about to all
tumble together, Letty abruptly changed direction, circling to the right
and vanishing from the man's sight. She then reappeared directly in
front of one of the men who had almost collided with the leader.

"...One."

She vanished from that man's sight too. As she slipped past, she
delivered a horizontal strike, leveraging her rotation, to the side of
his head.

"Gu-gah..."

A dull, heavy sound rang out as the blow landed on top of his helmet...
And the man collapsed with a small cry. By the time the clanking sound
of the fallen man's armor hitting the ground rang out, she had already
leaped into the center of the group.

"T-Take this!?"

Another frantically tried to strike, but the longsword was somewhat
restricted in their tight formation. Lacking sufficient momentum, he
failed to catch Letty as she ducked underneath it.

"Two."

Striking the exposed back of the man's head, she knocked him
unconscious.

The remaining three, realizing they had been encircled, frantically
turned around. But in a quickly assembled group with poor coordination,
their bodies got in each other's way.

"Three, four."

Exploiting that gap, Letty stepped in once again. Her shortsword found
the jaw of the man on the left, knocking him out. She drove a thrust
into the throat of the man on the right.

"Now, just one left."

Only the man who had originally led the charge remained.

"W-What are you!?"

"...Who knows?"

Frustrated by Letty's evasive answer, the man raised his sword above his
head. *I see.* Indeed, she could see it clearly. The trajectory, the
timing, and the force with which he would swing.

Therefore, she boldly stepped forward. The sword was brought down, as if
to stop her from approaching... and struck the ground. With perfect
timing, she slid her own blade upwards, deflecting her opponents at the
last moment. To a bystander, it might have looked like the sword passed
right through Letty's body.

Then, her sword was brought down upon the defenseless man's head. The
strike, carrying Letty's weight, made a sickening sound as it dented the
helmet.

"Ah, if I had to say. Just a nameless swordswoman, I suppose."

Letty's murmur didn't reach the ears of the man who had lost
consciousness and fallen to the ground.

"Now, there are... eight people left, I think."

She looked around the arena again. Other contestants had fallen, but a
considerable number were still standing, either fighting or searching
for their next opponent. This preliminary round would continue until all
of them were defeated.

"Well then... let’s go."

With no sign of strain, Letty, shortsword in hand, calmly headed toward
the other participants.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The blade flashes, and she dances.

With every cut and thrust, an opponent falls to the ground.

It is a scene reminiscent of a dream.

Up Next: The Crucible of Fervor

While some secretly throw cold water over it.
