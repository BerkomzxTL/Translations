## Chapter 152: A Still Distant Back

In the end, after various events that night, it wasn’t until after dawn
before they finally fell asleep. Letty, having experienced waking up
past noon for the first time, gazed at the fully bright window with a
sour expression.

"I really need to restrain myself," she vowed silently.

...She made the vow, but she had a strong feeling it would be broken
before long.

\*\*\*

At any rate, they spent their decided day off literally relaxing as
promised. Except for the night. The next day, Letty and Ellie headed to
their usual training spot as usual.

"Oh, you're here. Did you manage to restrain yourselves today?
Impressive, impressive," Dominique said while smirking.

"It's just too annoying to be constantly teased by Dominique," Letty
retorted coolly and picked up her wooden sword.

Yes, it was honestly annoying. Yet, it wasn't unpleasant. She knew that
if she *wasn't* teased, she would likely feel that something was
missing. If that was Dominique's charisma, then so be it, but it was
somehow unsatisfying.

Nevertheless, as long as she was going to be learning from her, she had
to accept it. Letty faced Dominique with an expression like she had
swallowed something bitter.

"What's with that face? Jeez. You're ruining your pretty looks."

"I don't think I'm pretty at all."

She replied curtly again, but—

"That's not true! Letty-san's face is the best in the world!"

"...Sorry, Ellie, I'd really appreciate it if you could... refrain a
little..."

She covered her face with one hand as Ellie's voice came from the side.
She didn't know what expression to make, but she knew very well that
Dominique must not see this face.

\*\*\*

"...Sorry to keep you waiting."

After enduring it for what felt like an age, Letty finally calmed down,
fixed her poker face, and faced Dominique again. Dominique, who had been
watching with amusement, slowly readjusted her stance.

"Huh, don't worry about it. Let's get started, shall we?"

And so, their usual sparring began.

*Clink*, the wooden swords lightly crossed, and they faced each other.
As always, Letty took a right-half stance, and Dominique took a
right-center stance.

Letty initiated the attack, Dominique evaded and countered. Letty evaded
that and countered again. The wooden swords twisted and scraped against
each other, their movements seeking each other's openings. Starting
slowly, checking their movements, they gradually accelerated,
incorporating their footwork.

"Wow... as always... no, it's even worse now," Ellie murmured while
watching from the side.

Retreating. Chasing. Evading. Closing in. Their movements were based on
drawing a circle, initially centered on the point where their swords
met. That circle gradually widened, moving to the right and to the left.
They moved freely, never too close or too far, as if dancing a waltz.
Tensely, like on a battlefield, they watched for an opportunity.

"Hah! You're quite something, keeping up this long!"

"Sh-Shut up."

It was true that she could keep up longer than before. But the
difference was obvious when compared to Dominique, who still had the
leisure to make light remarks. *Not yet, still distant.* It was natural,
considering the decades-long gap, but still.

"T-Take this!"

Letty felt Dominique push her wooden sword forward. She paused her
footwork for a moment, using the force of her hip rotation to sweep the
attack away. She tried to knock it aside.

"!"

The moment she felt it firmly intercepted, she immediately disengaged
and dodged the follow-up attack. She flowed right, then dodged left to
escape the pursuit, somehow managing to regain her stance.

"Well, now, that wasn't bad, but you're a bit too tense. It gives away
too much. You need to make it less obvious."

*Clang,* the wooden swords clashed as if signaling something. The moment
Letty braced herself, thinking, *No way*, her sword was nearly knocked
out of her grip. She hastily recovered, taking a wide step back.

"...You've got to be kidding me?"

"It still can't cut iron, of course, but it's enough to use against a
human."

The bracing of her foot that lasted less than an instant, the rotation
of her core that showed no tension or preparatory movement. Could such a
slight difference, only noticeable because it was signaled, create such
a difference in power? She fought against the shock threatening to
overwhelm her, somehow fending off the next attack. While defending and
focusing on the exchange, she replayed Dominique's action in the back of
her mind.

*How did she transition into the movement? Her breathing? How much force
did she apply?*

The pursuit briefly slowed. Aiming for that opening, she tried again.

...Again, it was firmly intercepted.

"You really are something. You're already doing this right after the
last one."

"Th-Thank you, but..."

She frowned with frustration, understanding that Dominique had probably
let her land that blow. *Am I being toyed with? No, I’m being tested.*

If that was the case…

She sharpened her senses. She defended and countered. Another chance
would come.

Her body and brain, working at full capacity, rapidly sapped away her
breath and stamina.

And then, once more.

"There's this way, too, you know?"

A striking blow was smoothly evaded and then repelled by a push,
breaking her stance. Her body was left completely open when she tried to
pull her sword back. Before she could even think, her body moved. She
controlled the momentum of her falling body, narrowly evading the tip of
Dominique's sword.

"Hurry up, hurry up, the next one is coming!"

"W-wait!"

Even though she dodged, her stance was broken nevertheless, and
Dominique continued to attack relentlessly. She desperately, calmly,
parried the blows.

*Not yet, not yet.*

She felt like she could absorb anything today.

*More, more, this time.*

Cherishing it, savoring it, Letty gripped her wooden sword tighter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is not all for this one thing.

Still, she cannot afford to lose.

To her past, to her present, to her future. And above all, to the people
she has met.

To be a person she will not be ashamed of.

Up Next: The Day Before the Tournament

And so, she quietly sharpens her blade.
