## Chapter 122: A Conversation that Blooms Like a Flower

"…I didn't expect to be kept waiting this long," Letty complained with a
sour expression as she watched Dominique finally return with a cart.
…Much later than she had expected.

But Dominique wasn't apologetic at all; she just smiled meaningfully.
"Haha, well, something unexpected happened over there too."

"Unexpected? What happened?" Ellie inquired curiously.

“That's for you to see later,” Dominique responded evasively. “For now,
let's get down to business."

Unable to understand and with nothing else to go off of, Ellie and Letty
could only look at each other and silently agree to give up.

\*\*\*

Under Dominique's command, they split up, tied the men up, and then
performed some rough treatment to stop any bleeding. Ignoring any
groans, the suspected soldiers were then unceremoniously loaded onto the
cart and transported away. By the way, some tried to resist, but Letty
and Dominique quickly put them back in line… using various methods.

*Am I imagining things, or are the guards keeping a slight distance from
us again?* Letty noticed some odd behavior, but wasn’t sure of the
reason.

At any rate, they had successfully taken the men captive and returned to
the caravan. Letty spotted the unfamiliar woman standing beside the
carriages and narrowed her eyes. "Hey, Ellie. That's the woman who was
running away, right?"

Though a little confused, Ellie responded, "Huh? Oh, yes, that's her."

"...I see." Letty nodded slightly and continued to stare.

Suddenly, Ellie timidly pulled on her sleeve from the side.

"Um, Letty-san, why are you staring at her like that? Are you thinking
about changing your mind? It hasn't even been that many days yet?
Already? What does this mean? Was I just a fling to you? Or do you
prefer women like her? Because if you do, I'll even dye my hair and get
a tan."

In contrast to her reserved actions, Letty was being buried alive under
Ellie’s endless, monotone, yet heavy rapidfire. "Wait, wait, that's not
it, that's not it!” And so, she hurriedly stopped her. She then leaned
in and whispered into Ellie's ear, “You're the only one for me, so don't
worry."

Ellie came to halt in an instant. Witnessing her ears turn bright red
and rendered speechless, Letty herself became flustered. And oblivious
to her turmoil, Ellie recovered after a mere moment with a wide smile on
her face.

"Ahaha! Letty-san, there you go again, saying things like that! Other
people can hear us, you know!” *THWACK!* “Saying such things in public,
you!" Beaming with a mix of delight and embarrassment, Ellie slapped
Letty's back. Loudly. With a force that belied her appearance.

Letty groaned and stumbled, but her face showed relief. "Um... I'm
sorry...? I'm glad... the misunderstanding is cleared up...?"

It didn't make sense. It was unreasonable. But with a now-recovered
Ellie in front of her, she didn’t dare say it out loud. All she could
muster was a rather fragile looking smile.

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, the people who had witnessed this little farce were
discussing among themselves.

"Hey, Boss," One escort turned to Dominique.

"What is it?" She muttered back.

"Can't you do something about that lovesick couple? This is too much, I
can't stand it."

"If I could do something about it, I would have a long time ago. Just
endure it and let it go in one ear and out the other."

They muttered with exhausted looks. ...Though some of the men seemed to
be enjoying it.

\*\*\*

“Well, okay…” Letty, having finished calming Ellie down, redirected her
attention back to Dominique. “Hey, Dominique. Is that woman... a Cordor
royal?"

Hearing this, Dominique playfully replied, "Oh? Why do you think that?"

Letty continued with her train of thought, "The crest on the sleeve of
her clothes looks familiar. The one on her collar is probably from the
same lineage. I think it's a crest only permitted for the royal family
of Cordor."

"Correct. You're well-studied." Dominique laughed gleefully.

Meanwhile, the guards looked completely dumbfounded. "Wait, how did you
know from this distance?! Forget recognizing the crest, what kind of
person would be able to even see it from here!?"

"Hm... training?"

A straightforward response.

"No way! What kind of training would let you do that!"

Being accused by the men, Letty couldn't help but feel it was
unreasonable. And next to her, Ellie was looking at her with a smug
expression, as if it was her own accomplishment.

When they got back to the carriage, the woman in question, Tseren,
greeted them. "Welcome back, everyone. Ah, this is the first time I've
spoken to the two of you properly. I am Tseren Batbayar Cordor. It’s a
pleasure to meet you."

Though she welcomed them with the graceful demeanor of a well-educated
noblewoman, the overflowing adoration sparkling in her eyes was evident.
Ellie raised her guard while Letty felt slightly overwhelmed.

"It's a pleasure... My name is Egret. I'm a commoner, so just Egret,
with no last name."

"Likewise, I'm just Ellie. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance."

As the two bowed, Tseren bowed in return. When she raised her head, she
looked back and forth between their faces before sighing.

"Um, is something wrong...?" Ellie spoke with concern. Being unfamiliar
with the customs of this era, she wasn’t sure if she had made a blunder.
Even though they could handle any situation with their strength,
accidentally insulting royalty would be troublesome.

Tseren slowly shook her head. "No, there's nothing wrong... I just
thought you two looked so good together. Egret-sama is the husband, and
Ellie-sama is the wife, no?"

Letty and Ellie froze. Behind them, Dominique and the guards were
desperately trying to hold in their laughter.

Unaware of their internal turmoil, Tseren just looked at them with an
expression of pure admiration and continued:

"Ellie-sama, who can use such powerful magic, and Egret-sama, who has
such captivating sword skills... Besides being beautiful, you complement
each other in your roles. You are truly an ideal couple, aren't you? I
admire you so much."

Letty remained completely frozen, unable to say a word, while Ellie—

"N-no, no!” *Smiling, smiling.* “Letty-san and I aren't a perfect
couple, no, no!” *Beaming, beaming.* “But... but still, do we really
look that way?"

It was as if her limiter had been broken. Everything she had been
suppressing spilled out. Ellie unreservedly exposed her true feelings,
fidgeting and blushing all the while.

Tseren happily responded to her, "Yes, very much so. I feel like my eyes
have been opened, that there is also this form of love."

"Ohoh, no, 'a form of love,' you say! But... but mhm, yes, maybe you're
right... hehe ♪" Ellie opened her heart as all of her initial caution
dissipated.

Observing this, Letty furrowed her brows in distress.

"Hey, Dominique."

"What is it?"

"I don't know what kind of face I'm supposed to make right now."

"Funny you should say that, I feel the same way."

For once, Dominique also sighed.
