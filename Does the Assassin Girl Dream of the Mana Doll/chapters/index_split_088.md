## Chapter 111: Foreign Affairs

"By the way, Dominique. Weren't those bandits we just fought from
Gaschnar?"

"Ah, so you noticed too. Those guys from the other day were also
Gaschnar folk, you're right."

The Kingdom of Gaschnar.

A country south of Cordor, it was so warm it wouldn’t be incorrect to
call it tropical. It had a rainy and a dry season, and to cope with the
sun that was particularly relentless in the arid weather, people wore
loose, flowing clothes over their whole bodies. Though the recent
bandits weren't dressed exactly like that, their facial features and the
incongruity of their clothing weren't entirely hidden.

"But why would they come all the way to Cordor? I doubt it’s just for
seasonal work," Letty tilted her head while pondering out loud.

“...No, maybe that's part of it,” Dominique put her hand on her chin as
she spoke. “I've heard the king of Gaschnar can be quite temperamental,
and people can lose their heads over small things. Maybe something
happened over there."

Given what she knew of the king's personality, she couldn't completely
rule it out. Of course, it wasn't something that happened often. But
something was bothering her.

"Egret, are you any good at interrogation or things like that?"

"Um, well. I don’t think so."

"Is that so? Well, I hate to ask, but could you try to find out why they
came all this way?"

"Understood. I'll do my best."

Letty nodded uncertainly and headed toward the captured men.

And so…

In less than an hour, she had gotten everything out of them.

Using lie detection, she would make thin, superficial cuts, avoiding
major blood vessels, and then casually point out every lie and
contradiction until they broke. The guards watched on with pale faces,
Ellie observed as if it were perfectly normal, and Dominique muttered in
admiration, "She's good."

At the end, one of the guards let out a shriek, "Where did she get the
idea she wasn't good at it?!"

In any case, it seemed she was able to get the information they needed.

"Hmm... I see, stricter conscription and domestic law and order
crackdowns, huh? And they couldn't find work in Gaschnar, so they came
out here. This whole situation smells fishy."

"It smells fishy, but does that country have the resources to go on
foreign campaigns? Especially food."

"As far as I know, no. How about it?"

Dominique shrugged and turned to the merchant caravan leader, who had
turned pale from witnessing the interrogation. Jolting out of his daze,
he shook his head slightly, and then opened his mouth to answer.

"No, as far as I know, they shouldn't have that kind of capacity.
Because of the limited time for crops, they can barely feed themselves.
Starting a war abroad would be absolutely impossible."

"In that case, is it purely a strengthening of domestic security? Even
so, the scale is too large, and the crackdown seems too severe," said
Ellie, who, though unfamiliar with recent international affairs,
understood the general principles.

The crackdown did seem strict enough to destabilize the country.

"That's certainly true... But any more than this is just pure
speculation."

Dominique clapped her hands, ending the conversation there.

"For now, it's certain that people with a criminal history are fleeing
Gaschnar to Cordor. It looks like the roads will be crawling with these
types for the foreseeable future. We'll hand them over to the guards at
the next town and relay this information. To the Merchant's Guild, too.
We should be able to get a reward for the intel."

"You're quite the opportunist... If we get a reward, how will we split
it?"

"Oh, that'll be split three ways between me, you, and Ellie."

She pointed to herself, Letty, and Ellie in turn, and then grinned
broadly. Letty and Ellie exchanged glances and shrugged.

"Considering the effort it took to subdue them and the effort it took to
interrogate them, isn't a third too much for you, Dominique-san?" Ellie
spoke with exasperation.

Dominique smirked, "Well, I did do some work, and more importantly, I
was the one who used *this* the most, right?"

As she said that, she tapped her own head with her finger. Well, it was
true, they couldn't deny that, so they could only smile wryly.

"I understand, but I don't really want to accept it..."

"Ah, I know exactly what you mean. I don't *not* understand, but
accepting it feels like losing somehow, really."

"Hey, you two, that's quite a lot to say right in front of me."

Dominique laughed lightly in response to their candid comments. Neither
of them was truly serious, of course. Without realizing it, the three
had grown close enough to speak comfortably to each other.

Meanwhile, the others could only watch from a distance as the three,
each with their own outstanding abilities, demonstrated their skills.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The path of
swordsmanship also begins with a single step.

She says that first step is the most crucial.

Literally, don't neglect the ground beneath your feet.

Standing and walking are also skills.
