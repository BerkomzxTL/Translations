## Chapter 138: Next Steps

"I apologize! I was wrong, I regret it!"

"Ah, no, you don't have to go that far..."

King Batbayar's reaction to Letty's killing intent was remarkably and
admirably straightforward. His gesture of kneeling on the floor,
completely disregarding his royal status—which Tseren later explained
was the utmost form of apology in Cordor—was unknown to Letty at that
moment. However, she understood that it was an excessive apology, and
her earlier killing intent quickly dissipated, replaced by an anxious
urge for him to stand up.

"Exactly, Your Majesty. Even Egret is saying so."

"...Dominique. I somehow suspect you were the one who suggested the
bet."

"Oh my, your instincts are really sharp now, aren't they? That's
trouble."

"Dominique?"

And once again, the blizzard blew. Being the second time, Dominique was
more accustomed to it. She grinned widely.

"Hmm, you've got a good look on your face. Fine, shall I play along?"

"Gladly. Since this has come up, I'll say clearly what needs to be
said."

A cold pressure built between the two, and the surrounding people
shuddered in fear.

And then.

"That’s enough!!"

"Please, both of you, stop!!"

Ellie and Tseren cut into the scene where no one else could move,
somehow defusing the situation.

\*\*\*

"Now, Letty-san, though His Majesty Batbayar is generous and even made a
mistake this time..."

"My father is also at fault. And Dominique-sama, too! Teasing in that
way would naturally offend anyone, even Egret-sama..."

The lecturing continued relentlessly.

Ellie and Tseren were scolding Letty, Dominique, and Batbayar. The sight
was so unusual that the people around could only watch from a distance.
Although having guests join for breakfast was not uncommon in Cordor, it
was unheard of for the King, the host, to be making himself as small as
possible in his chair and on receiving end off a lecture.

Not only were Letty and Batbayar subdued, but Dominique, sensing the
atmosphere, was also behaving quietly. Just as the two women's lecturing
reached a pause, the meal was brought in, as if on cue. No, it was
probably actually on cue, given the relieved look on the head waiter's
face.

Just as the meal was about to begin, Letty looked around, noticing
something.

"Is it just His Majesty Batbayar and Princess Tseren? I thought I heard
there were two princes."

"Ah, I sent them both out early this morning towards the border.
Regarding that Gaschnar matter."

"Ah, I see..."

It seemed that some information had been extracted the night before, and
they had decided to dispatch a portion of the military to the border
area as a precaution. As the information could be false, they divided
the forces into two units, with each prince commanding one.

"Gaschnar's Gorada will do anything; you never know what he'll try. It's
best to be careful." Batbayar wore a rare, pained expression as he
spoke.

The relationship between the two countries was tense, and after numerous
conflicts, it was natural that he didn't hold favorable feelings.

As if to move past the slightly heavy atmosphere, he clapped his hands.
"Well, let's stop with the depressing talk. So, about Egret
participating in the Swordsmanship Tournament."

“Eh. Wait, me?” Letty stopped eating and tilted her head. "That's the
first I'm hearing of it."

"Is that so? Big Sis Dominique asked me, so I assumed you had been
told."

"...Dominique?"

*Glare.*

Dominique alone seemed unaffected by the icy gaze.

"The order of things just got mixed up. Besides, you want to know how
good what you've learned is, don't you?"

"I won't deny that. But receiving the news like this changes things
considerably."

Letty gave Dominique a disapproving look as she cackled. True, as
Dominique said, if asked whether she wanted to test her skills, the
answer was yes.

"Well, anyway. I only vaguely remember seeing the tournament when I was
a kid, and there's a rule that champions can't participate. But from
what Tseren and the others told me, Egret, you're pretty skilled
yourself, aren't you? So, I insisted."

"...I don't know if I can meet your expectations," Letty replied after a
moment of thought.

In reality, she didn't know how effective her skills would be against
the kind of people who enter a swordsmanship tournament. After all, she
was completely outclassed by Dominique, who had won that very
tournament.

"Nonsense. If you ask which is better, the me who won or the me now, the
me now is superior, so it's not something you should compare. If you
compare the me from back then to you now... well, you'd likely do very
well."

Dominique's words seemed to see right through Letty's worries, which
only made her lose even more confidence. Dominique likely knew this and
was doing it half on purpose. The other half, she suspected, was genuine
expectation.

"...I don't know if that's true. I feel like I've been subtly cornered.
But, well... I guess I'm fine with participating."

Her reply was hesitant. She didn't know how selfish or how much she
could act as she pleased. To be honest, the positive reactions from
those around her made her feel awkward.

"Don't worry, I have no intention of arranging everything for your
convenience." Whether to gauge Letty's feelings or just to tease her,
Dominique spoke lightly.

Letty frowned. "I don't really understand. What does that mean?"

"Ah, what she means is, while there’s no issue with your participation
in general, a special recommendation would be impossible. So, you'll
have to participate starting from the preliminaries." Batbayar picked up
the conversation.

However, the word "preliminaries" made Tseren's expression cloud over.
"Um, Father. Starting from the preliminaries, does that mean...
Egret-sama will be in the group elimination round?"

"I have no choice. I considered giving her a special entry, but aside
from us who have met her and know her skill, others would only see it as
favoritism."

It seemed this was not what Batbayar ideally wanted, either. Tseren was
even more displeased.

"Uh, what form does the group elimination round take?"

"Ah, well, usually about ten or so participants are gathered in a large
arena, and the rule is that the last person standing moves on. This
swordsmanship tournament has become quite famous and attracts many
participants... We use blunted weapons, and killing an opponent results
in disqualification, so major accidents don't often happen, but
still..."

Tseren answered Letty's question hesitantly. She saw now why Tseren was
worried. And she also understood why Dominique wanted her to participate
in that format.

"I see. ...So what you’re saying is, ‘what good are you if you can't
handle that much’?" Letty frowned.

Dominique grinned. "It helps that you catch on so quickly."

A fight against a group in a limited space. It was definitely one of the
scenarios Letty needed to learn to handle in the future. The fact that
it was being provided in a relatively safe environment was probably not
a bad thing.

In that case.

"Hey, Ellie. Do you want to see the cool me?"

"Huh?” Ellie's eyes widened at the sudden question. “...Eh, well, of
course I want to see, but..."

When she got her answer, Letty nodded. "Understood. Then, I'll
participate."

Letty’s statement was delivered with a look brimming with satisfaction.

"Would you two stop showing off so early in the morning?"

Batbayar, one of the sources of the entire situation, grumbled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It had been instilled a long time ago.

Something accumulated unconsciously and earnestly.

Without being told its meaning, without knowing it, just
single-mindedly.

All of it was for this moment.
