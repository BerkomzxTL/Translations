## Chapter 103: An Encounter with the Exotic

And so, they continued to hold hands for a while. The two just sat side
by side on the bed, silently taking in the liveliness of the city
faintly permeating the room.

How much time passed like that?

"Shall we go for dinner now?"

"...Yeah. I guess it's time."

So they said, but neither of them stood up right away. Noticing this,
they looked at each other and chuckled, squeezed their hands tightly
once, and then slowly let go, seemingly reluctant to part. Then, the two
descended down to the tavern below.

The tavern, after the sun had fully set, was filled with the noise of
patrons who had already had some drinks. They navigated their way
through the crowd, found an empty table, and settled down.

The proprietress soon arrived and handed them the menu. They took it and
leaned their heads together to go through the options.

"Wow, it looks like lamb is very popular around here."

"Now that you mention it... there was a lot of pork and beef in
Jurastin."

The central plains extending toward the Kingdom of Cordor were, as the
name suggested, vast grasslands home to many nomads. They traveled on
horseback with large numbers of sheep that were raised for slaughter.
This is how they lived on the move. Though not originally ones to
settle, due to various circumstances, Cordor was a nation founded by
such nomads.

Cordoba, which bordered the central plains, appeared to be a place where
nomads frequently stopped to sell their sheep. Written on the menu were
several Cordor-style meals mixed in alongside familiar dishes.

"...This herb-roasted lamb looks delicious, doesn't it?"

"Ellie, you're quite the carnivore, aren't you... I think you should go
ahead and order it."

"It's just that you don't eat enough, Letty-san. Ah, then let's go with
this, too! A lamb stew, it says. Nngh, but I'm also curious about this
deep-fried lamb bun!"

A smile naturally bloomed on Letty's face as she watched Ellie pore over
the menu, struggling with what to choose. Ellie, who had said she wanted
to eat delicious food, had a huge appetite for it. In fact, it was a
guilty pleasure of Letty’s to see her enthusiastically yet agonizingly
wrestle with the menu.

However, since she didn't seem to be reaching a conclusion anytime soon,
Letty decided to help, "Well, if you can't finish it, I'll eat it. You
can order whatever you want, Ellie."

“Really?! Thank you, Letty-san!” Ellie looked up, thanked her with a
sparkling smile, and immediately called out to the proprietress, "Ah,
excuse me, ma'am!"

Though she had been chuckling at the sight, Letty had to quickly put a
stop to things, given the sheer volume of her order.

\*\*\*

"Mmm\\ This herb roast is so delicious\\! It's got a nice chewiness when
you bite into it, but the texture is just right, allowing you to slice
through it without much resistance. The well-balanced salt brings out
the flavor of the meat and the juices, and the aromatic herbs, which are
used generously, eliminate any gamey odor and turn it into flavor
instead... It's simple yet profound, and I feel like I could eat this
forever!"

"Oh, really... That's good. You look satisfied."

In the end, most of the dishes they ordered disappeared into Ellie's
stomach.

*Well, it’s not an actual stomach but I’m not sure what to call it, so
maybe "stomach” (tentative). At least it seems we won’t need to worry
about leftovers…*

Thinking that, Letty picked up the bowl placed in front of her. She
recalled its description: fermented sheep's milk mixed with sugar. She
scooped a spoonful of the white substance and put it in her mouth.

At that moment, a jolt ran through Letty.

The immediate impact upon entering her mouth. As it melted, it coated
her entire tongue, and the understanding hit her belatedly. The richness
of the milk and the sweetness of the sugar elevated the flavor
completely. She felt a sensation as if her tongue were being
constricted, which somehow led to a feeling of immense satisfaction.

As she swallowed, she let out a satisfied sigh. Ellie looked at her
intently, wondering what had happened. "Letty-san? W-what's wrong?"

"Huh? Uh... what is this...? My tongue feels tight, and my chest feels
warm... I feel so incredibly fulfilled..." She murmured with a dazed,
almost rapturous expression.

Ellie observed Letty with a look of surprise. Then, she smiled faintly,
"Letty-san. That's what 'delicious' means."

"...This is 'delicious'?" Letty looked up. “I see, this is... I see...”
Then, she looked back down at the bowl. She nodded in understanding
before taking another spoonful. “I see...” And then, another.

“I think I understand why Ellie is so particular about delicious
food..." Fully absorbed in eating, she continued absentmindedly as Ellie
watched on while beaming.

"...I wish I could see that look on your face from my cooking," she
murmured softly. Ellie made a resolution to start making sweet things
from now on.

"I'll have another one."

"Letty-san? No eating too much, okay?"

Ellie admonished Letty after witnessing her devour her bowl in an
instant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A night of enjoying foreign cuisine.

Back in the room, they were alone again, as always.

And as always, time passed, sometimes quietly, sometimes lively.

Up Next: After-Dinner Amusements

The "usual" is changing little by little.
