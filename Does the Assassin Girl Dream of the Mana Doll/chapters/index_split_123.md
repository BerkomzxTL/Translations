## Chapter 146: Absent-Minded

As they stepped into the storage vault, they were hit with the passage
of time. No one had stepped inside for 1,500 years; a thick layer of
dust coated the floor, swirling up with every step. Moving through the
room while covering her mouth with a cloth, Letty heard a mechanical
sound.

"The ventilation system seems to be working. But it's not strong enough
to vacuum the dust, so it hasn't been cleaned, though."

"Well, I guess that can't be helped..."

Carefully avoiding inhaling the swirling dust, they searched the vault.
According to Ellie, the contents were meticulously organized.

"Everything that should be here is in its proper place. Finding what we
need shouldn't be too difficult."

Letty nodded, thinking, *I see.* She looked with curiosity at the items
on the shelves. Although Letty could read the ancient script, being a
magic user, the writing here was mostly specialized terminology. The
descriptions and part numbers of components were completely unfamiliar
to her, so she couldn't be of much help.

For example, she vaguely understood the phrase ‘magic transmission
circuit,’ but there were multiple model numbers, and she couldn't tell
which one was compatible with Ellie. She had many questions, but she
decided to just follow quietly, careful not to interrupt.

It was then that Ellie, who had been moving confidently through the
storage vault, suddenly came to a stop.

"The part should be somewhere on this shelf... Let's see..." Ellie
stopped to search meticulously.

"...Hey, that shape looks familiar," Letty said, looking elsewhere.

Ellie moved closer. "What, oh! This is it, this is it! You remembered
well, Letty-san!"

Letty spoke proudly, "Mm, I'm quite good at memorizing. It sometimes
involved matters of life and death, you see."

"Ah, well, that's... that was your line of work..." For some reason,
Ellie averted her eyes.

Letty tilted her head at Ellie's reaction but returned her gaze to the
shelf. "It's good that we found it, but what do we do next? I assume we
need to replace the part."

"Ah, yes. Given the state of this research facility, I think the
replacement device should be operational, so I intend to use that. If,
by some chance, it's not working..."

"...If it's not working?"

Ellie turned to Letty and smiled broadly.

"Please replace it with your own hands, Letty-san."

"Eh? But I've never done anything like that..."

"It's alright, it's not that difficult! There should be a manual, too!"

"Eeeh..."

Letty was hesitant, inversely proportional to Ellie's enthusiasm. She
would be touching a crucial part of Ellie; there was no room for error.
When asked to perform such a critical and completely specialized task,
her apprehension was understandable.

After a brief back-and-forth, Ellie suddenly put on a tearful
expression. "...I can only entrust something this important to you,
Letty-san."

"Ugh... I think there’s a dirty trick being used here..." Letty took a
step back, unable to refuse Ellie’s tearful plea.

Logically, she knew she was the only one who could do it. And
emotionally, she couldn't entrust it to anyone else either.

"Only if that device is not working, alright?"

"Yes, thank you!"

Letty finally caved, and Ellie happily hugged her.

\*\*\*

With the part secured, Letty and Ellie left the vault and continued
their exploration. They advanced, finding no monsters or golems, but
maintaining their vigilance. Eventually, they found a relatively large
room on a floor near the deepest part of the facility.

"Ah, I think the replacement device I mentioned earlier is here."

"I see... It certainly has the atmosphere of a workshop."

They peered into the room through the door Ellie had opened. Again,
there was nothing moving inside, just equipment emitting a faint light.
A workbench in an open area and various components stacked in a corner
gave it a slightly different atmosphere from a researcher's room. Ellie,
who had stepped inside first, immediately went to one of the devices and
began checking it.

"...Yes, this device is operational. There shouldn't be any problem
using it."

"Oh, good."

Letty sighed in relief. That meant she wouldn't have to perform the
critical procedure herself.

"I'm a little disappointed, though. I wanted you to insert it,
Letty-san."

"Ellie, please stop making jokes like that; I don't know how to
respond."

"Ahaha, alright, I understand\\♪"

Letty frowned with embarrassment when Ellie peered into her face, and
Ellie easily backed off. *Honestly*, Letty muttered quietly after
realizing she was being teased. Despite complaining, it was strangely
enjoyable, not at all unpleasant.

Ellie then immediately began operating the device. She moved her fingers
on a panel and placed the component they had just retrieved onto a
dish-like area. Having finished the setup, she then turned to Letty.

"Well, the preparation is complete. Now, when you press this button, the
procedure will start. But I have to lie on that workbench over there,
so... could you please press the button, Letty-san?"

"Ah, yes. I can certainly do that much."

"Fufu, but this, too, is something I can only ask someone I completely
trust, right?"

"That's true... Yes, I'll do it."

After all, she was about to allow this device to manipulate her body;
there was no guarantee it wouldn't cause any harm. Therefore, Letty was
the only one she could entrust with pressing the start button.

Smiling, Ellie lay face down on the workbench. She adjusted her position
for a moment, lightly smoothed her clothes, and took a deep breath.

"Please do it, Letty-san."

"Hmm, alright."

Prompted, Letty pressed the button.

The device instantly began to emit a faint light and started a low hum.
Various readouts appeared on the panel, allowing the status to be
monitored. However, Letty had no idea what any of the data meant.

\[Procedure start. Checking status of Eliminator Identification Number
739. Physical circuit normal. Physical configuration normal.\]

Light scanned Ellie's body, examining her interior. The sensation itself
was familiar to Ellie, having experienced it numerous times. Though it
was hard to believe this was the first time in 1,500 years.

\[Information processing circuit anomaly confirmed. Matches replacement
component. Commencing replacement procedure.\]

An arm-like metallic appendage, composed of an unknown material,
extended toward Ellie's head. It touched the back of her head, and a
cord-like object inserted itself.

\[Memory circuit data retention initiated. Central processing unit
temporary halt confirmed. Information processing circuit disconnected.\]

Letty could only watch as the procedure proceeded matter-of-factly with
a mechanical voice. It was a strange sight. The familiar figure of Ellie
was surrounded by an unfamiliar mechanical arm. She was engulfed in a
faint light, subjected to an unknown procedure, and something was being
inserted... All without a drop of blood.

\[Information processing circuit replacement complete. Central
processing unit reconnected. Restarting. Checking system version
information. Commencing version update.\]

Letty could tell the procedure was nearing its end from the panel
display. She wanted it to be over quickly.

"Please, come back soon, Ellie."

She whispered worriedly.
