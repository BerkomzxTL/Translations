## Chapter 150: An Atypical Night

About an hour after their rest, the two managed to reach the deepest
part of the Research Facility. It was a relief that their safety was
secured, but at the same time a shame that they hadn't made any notable
discoveries in the process.

"In any case, further exploration is impossible... Let's rest for
today."

"Hmm, that would be for the best... I'm feeling a bit tired after all."

In agreement, they both sat down on a bed. Apparently, this was the
staff's living quarters, with over ten private rooms lined up, each with
a bed. They had borrowed one of these rooms. After Ellie had thoroughly
locked it, thanks to her restored functionality, they were finally able
to catch their breath.

After eating the portable rations they brought and drinking water, the
weariness of the day weighed heavily on them as their minds calmed down.

"I'm grateful we can sleep on a bed instead of the floor… Though the
sheets are, well, unusable."

"That can't be helped... After all, too much time has passed."

The mysterious material used for the mattress had somehow retained some
elasticity, but the sheets covering it were already tattered. They
removed the sheets, covered the mattress with a blanket they had brought
for camping, and added another blanket on top, creating a reasonably
comfortable sleeping spot. Moreover, a certain amount of warmth was
guaranteed since two of them were snuggling together.

"Let's just go to bed, okay?"

"Yeah, I agree with that. But, Ellie..."

"Yes? What is it?"

"...We're not going to do anything else today, alright?"

"...N-No, come on, even I know that, of course."

Ellie, who had been caught patting the bed invitingly, froze for a
moment. Then, she turned to Letty and gave her a smile. A clearly
forced, artificial smile that anyone could recognize.

Seeing that expression, Letty couldn't help but burst into laughter.

"Stop making that face. When we get back, I'll make up for it with two
days' worth."

"I-It's not like that's all I'm ever thinking about! B-But, yes
please..."

She countered with a flustered expression, but ultimately couldn't deny
her desires, throwing in that last bit in a small voice.

\*\*\*

When they got into bed and lay down, they truly felt the fatigue. A
fierce drowsiness hit them, so strong that their consciousness felt
ready to slip away the moment they closed their eyes. As if it were okay
to just let everything go.

Letty re-embraced Ellie, who was snuggled up to her as usual. She felt a
vague anxiety that Ellie might disappear if she didn't hold her tightly.
During their earlier rest, she had embraced Ellie as she was being
swayed by a side of herself she didn't recognize. Now, Letty held her to
anchor herself, she who was being shaken by an unknown anxiety.

Ellie in her arms wore a look of utter bliss. She had supposedly
transitioned to sleep mode just a moment ago. She must have had this
expression before falling asleep. That thought brought a small sense of
relief.

"I wonder if I managed to alleviate Ellie's anxiety even a little..."

Letty murmured very softly. Ellie had been close to being distraught, if
not quite there, during their night exploration. If she could have
helped ensure Ellie's peace of mind even slightly, that would be a
source of great happiness for her.

"I think you can rely on me more, Ellie."

If asked, she would surely say she was already relying on her more than
enough. But for Letty, it seemed that was still not enough.

She inhaled deeply while still embracing her. The sweet scent of Ellie
drifted gently.

*Ah, this is bad.* She felt like she would fall asleep in a daze.
Thinking that, she closed her eyes. Her premonition was correct, and
Letty soon let go of her consciousness.

\*\*\*

The next morning. Probably morning. If the clock was right, it had been
seven bells. She seemed to have overslept a little.

"Good morning, Ellie."

"Good morning, Letty-san."

Letty greeted Ellie, who had apparently woken up earlier and was looking
at her with a refreshed expression. They were very close.

Suddenly, a thought occurred to Letty. "Hey, Ellie. Have you been
watching my face this whole time?"

"Not the *whole* time, but I was looking for quite a while." Spoken with
a smug look on her face. Rather than remorseful, she seemed quite proud.
Letty smiled. Since Ellie was only doing what she herself often did, she
couldn't fault her.

Harboring a faint feeling of defeat, Letty sat up and checked her
physical condition. It seemed the fatigue was almost entirely gone. She
felt a mixture of surprise and resignation at her own robustness.
Despite walking so much, she was already fine. Of course, she was
grateful for that in this situation.

"Hmm... Everything is normal on my end. How about you, Ellie?"

"Yes, no status anomalies for me, I'm in great shape!"

As she spoke, Ellie gave a triumphant fist pump. The gesture was both
funny and adorable. Letty couldn't help but chuckle.

"That's reassuring. Let's continue the exploration today while heading
back."

"Yes, let's do that!"

And so, the day began. As usual. From an unusual place. But as usual,
together.

\*\*\*

After eating a light breakfast and resting briefly, they resumed their
exploration. This time, they retraced their steps, going up from the
deepest level. They searched several rooms that seemed to be individual
research labs, but found hardly any documents left.

They thought they were going to have to leave empty-handed when—

"Ah... This looks relevant."

Ellie picked up a book. Letty peered over her shoulder, however...

"...I can read the characters, but... what is this?"

Since she could use magic, reading ancient script should have been easy
for her. But the overwhelming number of technical terms, the
incomprehensible string of numbers... If she were asked to understand
all of it, it would be impossible.

"Um, it looks like a specification manual for late-model Dolls, such as
the Eliminator. If I can decipher this, we might find something."

"I see... Then let's take this back with us."

"Yes, let's do that."

Ellie nodded at Letty's suggestion. There was no one in this place who
could utilize it, and it was questionable whether such a person even
existed anymore. Therefore, it would be more useful if Ellie, who could
still understand it to some extent, took it back.

"I hope you find something."

"Yes, me too..."

Ellie's voice as she replied to Letty trembled slightly with both
expectation and anxiety.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basking in the sunlight. The realization of returning to the ordinary.

Peace, or perhaps fulfillment.

In short, it is what it means to be alive.

Up Next: When Temptation Takes Control

It happens precisely because they are alive.
