## Chapter 125: The Presence of an Adult

"So, the situation isn't the worst, but it can't exactly be called good,
either. But, naturally, leaving Princess Tseren to fend for herself
isn't an option, and I'd like the boss to be prepared. What do you say?"

As Dominique spoke casually, Princess Tseren was left wide-eyed and
speechless. The merchant who led the caravan, however, readily nodded as
if it were a matter of course.

"Of course. There is no way we could abandon Princess Tseren here."

"As expected, you’ve got some impressive determination."

"After all, if this goes well, we could establish a connection to the
Cordor royal family, couldn't we? There's no way we'd pass up on that
opportunity."

"And as expected… quite shrewd."

Letty and Ellie wore placid smiles while listening to the merchant’s and
Dominique's easygoing, back-and-forth comedy act.

Tseren blinked repeatedly, watching them. After a short while, she
timidly spoke, sounding apologetic, "Um, both of you... no, everyone,
are you sure about this? Wouldn't I be dragging you into danger because
of me...?"

"Well, that's how we make a living, so there's no point in worrying
about it." Dominique shrugged her shoulders.

In addition, the guards and warriors laughed in agreement. "No kidding.
Besides, it might even be good for business."

It was such a simple answer that Tseren couldn’t help but be confused.
"B-but what about these merchants?" She looked around at the others. The
merchants, who traveled frequently, possessed a certain toughness, but
their faces and physiques clearly indicated they were unaccustomed to
violence. Yet, they all looked undeterred, and some were even smiling.

"In this line of work, we've faced danger before. Besides, as I just
mentioned, it's not without benefit to us. And above all else," the
merchant paused, skillfully winked, and offered a mischievous smile.
"Even though I may not look it, I have a sensitive nature. If I were to
abandon you, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night."

Tseren was left dumbfounded, and the people around either burst out
laughing merrily or nodded in agreement. Dominique, in particular,
roared with laughter, and when it subsided a little, she showed a sly
grin.

"Easy for you to say, with that perpetually well-rested face of yours."

"No, no, it's true! The slightest thing will restrict me to only three
meals a day."

"That's normal! What, are you saying you usually eat four?"

"If you include snacks, it's about five."

"Is that why you have that belly? You should try to trim down a bit."

Laughter, unrestrained and hearty, erupted. After indulging in such a
comical routine for a while, Dominique turned to Tseren and smiled
fearlessly. "So, Princess Tseren, the ruffians here are all quite
resolute. We appreciate your concern, but please don't worry about us."

Seeing Tseren's wide-eyed surprise, Dominique suddenly revealed a gentle
smile.

"Besides, you're only about fifteen years old, right? It's ten years too
early for you to be worrying about older folks like us. I know royalty
has many responsibilities, but in a time like this, you should allow
yourself to be dependent." She patted Tseren on the head. After a few
seconds of staring blankly, Tseren’s face crumpled, and tears welled up.
"It's alright. We're in a situation like this, in a place like this.
Everything's mutual, so it's fine to rely on us."

"I-is that alright? Is it alright for me to be dependent on you?" Tseren
whispered with a trembling voice.

And Dominique continued boldly, "If it's on me, sure, go right ahead."

"W-waah... Dominique-sama!" Tseren hugged Dominique, her voice choked
with tears.

Dominique gently embraced her. Holding her, she gently patted her
shoulder repeatedly. "After what you've been through, there's no way
you're not exhausted. Get it all out now, right here."

It was expected that the journey from here to the royal capital would be
a forced march with no time for vulnerability. If that was the case, it
was better to let her release her pent up emotions now and calm down.
That was the calculation. But it was also due to the fact that she was
moved by Tseren's admirable effort to hide her fear and hardship. It was
an action born of both reasons.

*I'm far too soft*, Dominique muttered to herself. Yet, she herself was
quite pleased with the situation.

\*\*\*

“Hey, Dominique.”

After some time had passed and Tseren had finally calmed down, Letty
spoke up. “Neither Ellie nor I are *ruffians*, nor are we *older folks*.
I'm a little dissatisfied with being lumped in with all of you."

"Ahaha, I kind of thought that too." Ellie laughed and agreed with
Letty's rare, slight discontent.

Dominique, unperturbed, just laughed back lightly. "It doesn't matter,
does it? You're all thinking the same thing, aren't you?"

"Well, sure, but... I don't know, it doesn’t feel right..."

Tseren, seeing Letty still somewhat dissatisfied despite being brushed
off, bowed her head apologetically. "I-I'm so sorry, Egret-sama, for
making you feel uncomfortable..."

Flustered, Letty stammered, "Ah, no, um, you don't need to apologize,
Princess Tseren... I mean..."

"Yes, both Letty-san and I *both* agree. We have no objection to
protecting you, Princess Tseren." Ellie threw her a lifeline, though
with an odd emphasis on the word *both*.

Tseren chuckled softly at the sight of the two. "Fufu, thank you, both
of you. You two really are very close, aren't you?"

Seeing Tseren smile, even though her eyes were still teary, brought a
sense of relief to Letty, Ellie, and Dominique.

And they all shared the same thought: *We will safely escort this
admirable princess to the capital.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A life traversing the grasslands is always fraught with danger.

If you can’t keep up on your own two feet, you’ll be left behind.

Like befriending a horse.
