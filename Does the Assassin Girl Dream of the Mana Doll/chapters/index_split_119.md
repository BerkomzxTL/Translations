## Chapter 142: Treasure Hunting

After that, they chatted and trained to their heart's content. And by
lunch, the session was over for the day. This was due to Dominique's
policy that forcibly overdoing it was pointless. In fact, rest was part
of the training.

"You're more tired than you think, you know. Especially on days like
today when you've tackled a lot of new things at once. In the long run,
getting proper rest is important."

Letty certainly agreed with Dominique's advice. Suppressing her eager
feelings, she decided to stop for the day and returned to the inn.

"Ah, welcome back, Letty-san. I'm sorry I couldn't go to practice with
you..." Ellie, finally recovered enough to get up by noon, looked sorry
she couldn’t accompany Letty.

In turn, Letty apologized, "No, it's fine. If anything, I'm the one who
should apologize. I got a little too carried away..."

However, seeing this, Ellie pondered for a moment. "Letty-san, you don't
have to apologize. I asked for it, and...” Then her face flushed
slightly. “I was very happy."

"Ellie..."

"Letty-san..."

Seeing her wear a shy but happy smile, Letty found herself instinctively
embracing her. In the embrace, Ellie let out a happy sigh, closed her
eyes, and felt Letty with her entire body. They lingered for a while,
feeling each other's warmth and the softness of their bodies. Then,
without a word, they gradually loosened their arms.

Looking at each other from a close distance, Ellie gently closed her
eyes. Letty already knew what that implied. Slowly, she leaned in,
starting with a light, barely-there kiss. After repeating that lightly a
few times, Ellie wrapped her arms around Letty's neck, clinging to her
passionately. The breaths they occasionally let out grew hot and ragged.

*More, more.*

Something boiling from deep within her body.

*I want you.*

*I want Ellie.*

"Mmm... Letty-saaan..."

Ellie's sweet, pleading voice. Under the gaze of those languid, hot
eyes, her reason felt about to snap.

But.

"Wait, Ellie, we have to eat lunch..."

"No, let's do that later, okay? It'll be quick, quick!"

Her beseeching voice was cloyingly sweet. As Ellie rubbed her hips
against her, Letty felt a surge of heat in her own body.

"...Just one more time, okay?"

Though Letty intended for it to sound like a complaint, there was an
undisguisable eagerness.

"Yes! Just one time, just one time! Come here, Letty-san!" Ellie,
chuckling happily, immediately tumbled onto the bed and pulled Letty in,
as if she couldn't wait any longer. Letty offered no resistance.

In the end, it did not stop at one time, and lunch ended up being very
late.

\*\*\*

"...I think I really should learn to exercise restraint after all."

"Ugh, y-yes, I agree..."

This exchange occurred as they made their way through the crowds of the
capital. After somehow managing to eat a very late lunch, with Letty
supporting the still-shaky Ellie, they ventured out once she recovered
slightly.

*…Not good. This posture is not good,* Letty agonized internally.
Naturally, under the pretext that she hadn't fully recovered, Ellie was
clinging to Letty's arm.

Her generous bosom was constantly pressed against her. Moreover, it was
the same bosom she had just been thoroughly playing with just moments
ago. She was worried that she would lose control again, despite having
just resolved to practice restraint. And in the middle of the city, no
less. *No, no, no,* she desperately told herself.

However, it was true that Ellie's footing was still a little unsteady.
So when Ellie clung to her, she couldn't *not* support her. That meant
she couldn't break this intimate posture. As they walked, Letty
continued to fight her own worldly desires.

"The place we were told about is just ahead, right?"

"Eh, ah, yes, it should be. Let's see... Ah, that sign is probably it."

Startled back to reality by Ellie's question, Letty glanced around. The
sign she spotted was... Well, it was still too far away for even Ellie
to read it properly. Despite that, they still moved toward the indicated
location with confidence.

"Yes, this is definitely the place."

They arrived at the shop with a sign written in a somewhat pretentious
style. It mainly dealt in magical artifacts, including those excavated
from the ancient ruins near the capital. Letty glanced inside, confirmed
it was the right place, and they entered.

"...Welcome."

A rather sullen-looking man who seemed to be the shopkeeper called out
from behind the counter, where he remained seated. Letty gave him a
light "Hello" in return and started looking around at the items on
display.

"...Well?"

"Let's see... I think many of the items here are high quality, but our
target isn't here."

Ellie replied to Letty's question, picking up one of the items.

"This, for example, is an ancient magical energy transmission device. If
cleverly embedded in a staff, it should significantly increase the power
of spells. The fact that an item in such good condition is on display
suggests this shop is quite a find, but..."

The shopkeeper, who had been listening in on Ellie's explanation, spoke
up, "Hmph. Young lady, you know quite a bit for your age."

Ellie turned, smiling brightly. "No, no, it's just that the shopkeeper
who stocks such fine items is the true connoisseur, even my eyes can
tell that much."

"That's a nice compliment, even if it's flattery. What are you looking
for?" Clearly catching his attention, the shopkeeper came out from
behind the counter.

Ellie carefully placed the item back in its original spot with both
hands, and the shopkeeper's eyes narrowed with pleasure.

"Yes, it's a magic-related tool, something like a crystal..."

When she described the shape and color, the previously cheerful
shopkeeper looked thoughtful.

"Ah, is there a problem?"

"Oh no, it's not that you two are a problem. It's just that I remembered
someone who bought several of those very things recently."

"What? Someone bought *those*? They aren't tools with that many uses..."

"Yes, that's what I thought too."

The shopkeeper and Ellie puzzled over the matter, ignoring Letty, who
wasn't familiar with such tools.

"And the person who bought them seems to have come from Gaschnar. Their
clothing was Cordor style, but there was a subtle regional accent in
their speech. Now that I think about it, it seems suspicious that they
were trying to conceal their identity."

"I’m not one to talk, but someone from Gaschnar, a country we don't have
good relations with, specifically came to buy those... That does sound
strange."

Someone bought multiple of those specialized tools. *What for?* She knew
she wouldn't get a clear answer to the question that had popped into her
mind.

"Anyway, that's why they're sold out. My apologies."

"Oh, no, not at all. Thank you for letting us know."

As she bowed her head, Ellie mentally noted that she should probably
inform Batbayar of this information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

That place; Once boasting prosperity, now a mere shadow of its former
self.

The many bodies of the dead buried in the earth, and monsters running
rampant.

The faintly remaining residue: honor or a tragic death?

Up Next: To the Ruins

The scent of the ancient is not sweet.
