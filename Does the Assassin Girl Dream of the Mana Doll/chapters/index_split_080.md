## Chapter 104: After-Dinner Amusements

"I... ate too much..."

Despite Ellie's attempts to stop her, Letty managed to sneak in two more
servings before barely making it back to their room and collapsing onto
the bed. She rolled onto her back and rubbed her stomach. Though
grumbling, satisfaction was clearly etched on her face as she let out a
long breath.

"Geez, I told you to stop. But, well, it was the first time I've seen
you eat so much, so I'm partly to blame for not saying more."

Ellie seemed perfectly fine even after eating just as much. She brought
a chair up to the bedside with a wry smile and slowly pulled out her
drawing board.

Seeing her clip paper onto the board and take out a stick of charcoal,
Letty tilted her head and attempted to perch herself up as she spoke,
"Are you practicing your drawing? I'd like to lie down for a little
longer..."

"Oh, it's fine. Please stay lying down, Letty-san. Actually, when I saw
you lying there, I thought, 'This is it,' so actually I want to draw you
lying down," she replied seriously.

With a bright smile and a demeanor that wouldn’t take no as an answer.

"O-oh... well, okay... but it’s a little embarrassing, sorry..."
Confused by how assertive Ellie was being, Letty lay back down on the
bed. She felt utterly embarrassed to be exposing herself in such a
defenseless position and to be stared at so intently.

*Now that I think about it, it’s strange how I’m leaving myself so open
without thinking.* The fact that she realized it yet still lay there
comfortably made her feel a little odd. *I guess I’ve changed quite a
bit since meeting Ellie.*

In truth, the persistent, clinging gaze was what made her most uneasy.
She found herself involuntarily fidgeting and squirming.

"Ah, Letty-san, please don't move. I'll be done soon."

"O-okay, sorry..."

She apologized, yet still felt a little put out. *This feeling of being
stared at… aren’t I the victim here?* With resignation, Letty allowed
herself to be observed and drawn.

*Rustle, rustle.*

The soft scraping of drawing utensils.

It was rhythmic and somewhat comforting to listen to. More than
anything, being able to go along with what Ellie wanted to do made her
happy. ...Although she wished the occasionally intense, glittering stare
would let up a bit.

But the fact that she felt this way meant...

She made her decision.

"Hey, Ellie, can you listen while you draw?"

"Ah, yes, what is it?"

Ellie looked up for a moment, thought for a little, and then started
moving her hand again. The rhythm a bit slower than before.

She had a feeling Ellie already knew.

"...I've thought about it. I'm going to try learning swordsmanship from
Dominique."

"Ah, I figured as much."

*I see, it must have been obvious.* Even though she had taken much
deliberation, Ellie’s quick and casual response made Letty smile wryly.
But the thought that she had waited until she brought it up made her
happy.

"I'm sorry, is that okay?"

"It's not a matter of 'okay' or not. You're my Master, Letty-san.
Besides, you let me paint, so it wouldn't make sense for me to object,
would it?"

The slight change in her tone when she said "make sense" made Letty
wonder if she was imitating her. To be honest, it wasn't a very good
imitation. Still, she found it amusing and chuckled.

"...Thank you. While I'm training, she'll probably follow me around a
lot, and we might not get much time alone..."

"Could I think about that for a minute?"

"Eh, Ellie?"

Letty was startled by Ellie's sudden change of attitude. Seeing her
reaction, Ellie laughed and waved her hand, "Just joking. That much is
fine. As long as you get a separate room at the inn."

"Oh, that... I don't think she'll object."

And besides… She had been planning to do that herself. It was just a
little hard to bring up.

"Then I have no problem. If you've found something you want to do, I'll
support you."

"Thank you, Ellie."

As Ellie smiled brightly, Letty smiled back.

\*\*\*

Afterward, Ellie continued drawing for a while longer before showing
Letty the finished piece. ...The sight of herself lying down so
peacefully was more embarrassing than she had imagined.

"From now on, I'm never letting you draw me lying down again..."

"How cruel! Please, the way you curl up is absolutely adorable!
Actually, I wanted to give you more specific poses!"

As they were playing around like this, it got late. It was time for bed.

The late autumn night, with hints of the nearing arrival of winter,
could no longer be described as cool. It was too cold to sleep in only
her underclothes, so Letty changed into her pajamas. They were,
incidentally, a matching set that Ellie had prepared at some point.

And so, they crawled into bed. Both of them, in the same bed. It was a
fluid, natural movement.

"Ah... When it's this cold, cuddling up like this to keep warm is the
best, isn't it?"

"I won't deny it... but is it just me, or do I feel like I'm being
tricked..."

She grumbled, but ultimately made no attempts to move away. Letty
couldn't easily move anyway since her arm was under Ellie's neck in a
makeshift arm-pillow position. Well, she was the one who accepted that
position in the first place. It was the result of much trial and error
after they realized that two people in a single bed was too cramped.
...Even now, she couldn't help but feel a little deceived.

"I'm not tricking you. You don't dislike cuddling like this, do you,
Letty-san?"

"No, well, I don't dislike it. It's just... you know..."

She squirmed a little. Ellie clung to her and pressed her body close.

"You know, what?"

"...It's warm and you smell nice, so I feel so safe... I fall asleep so
deeply that I lose consciousness..."

“Eh?” When Ellie made a troubled sound, Letty looked at her. "Yes? It’s
normal to lose consciousness when you sleep, isn’t it?"

"Is that how it works? I always stay half awake…" Letty murmured in
confusion

Ellie stared intently. After thinking for a while, she hugged her even
tighter and began to nuzzle against her.

"W-wait, Ellie, what's wrong all of a sudden?"

"It's fine, you can fall asleep completely! If this helps you sleep,
I'll keep you as warm as you want! Come on! I'll be the lookout while
you're asleep!"

Driven by the realization that her presence made Letty feel safe, mixed
with the indignation of learning how Letty usually slept, Ellie started
trying various things to forcibly put her to sleep.

…One might think this would make it even more difficult to fall asleep.

But Letty couldn't help but giggle. It was a kind of interaction that
was just too enjoyable to dislike.

Laughing, playing, and eventually, dozing off. With a feeling of
contentment, Letty surrendered her consciousness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Winter mornings. It's always a drag to have to go outside into the
frigid air.

She wished to stay forever in this warmth.

That's what she thought.

Up Next: A Winter’s Morning—Departure Day

Will that warmth become the strength to rise?
