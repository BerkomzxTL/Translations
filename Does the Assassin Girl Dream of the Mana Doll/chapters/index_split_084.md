## Chapter 107: Preparedness

The merchant caravan and the guards were proceeding down the road.
Having just left the city, the possibility of situations arising was
minimal, yet they remained vigilant. Since something had already
happened recently on a road not known for bandits, it was better to be
safe than sorry.

There were five wagons in total. It was a significant amount of cargo,
befitting a trip to the royal capital. Each wagon had two guards,
positioned at the driver's seat and the cargo bed, respectively.

Letty and Ellie rode alongside on horseback. Letty was on the right
side, and Ellie on the left. Since Letty primarily swung her sword with
her right hand, she was better suited to deal with movement from the
right. Ellie was also right-handed, but that wasn’t particularly
important when using a magical barrier to defend. This was the reasoning
behind the arrangement.

"With this arrangement, Egret and Ellie, your reconnaissance is crucial.
I don't think anything will happen for a while, but it's not absolute. I
don't think you two would let your guard down, but be extra careful."

"Hm, understood. We won't neglect our perimeter watch. I'll use my
detection magic as appropriate."

"Yes, I'll also keep a careful eye out."

Dominique's command was masterful. She seemed well-accustomed to this
kind of thing. The others could only nod at her instructions and
arrangement, which left no room for objection.

She answered questions and doubts candidly, but carefully. At the same
time she was acting the same as always. Which meant that the Dominique
they had seen so far was only the tip of the iceberg. Realizing this,
Letty felt somewhat defeated. It was a matter of age and experience, but
still.

"Honestly, I want to talk with you about a lot of things on the way. But
there aren't many scouts better than you two, so I guess it can't be
helped. I'll save all that for the break."

"...Understood," Letty nodded.

A small part of her was disappointed. A conversation with Dominique,
however bothersome, would likely be fruitful. But that was a personal
matter. They were working now, and the job had to be prioritized. They
both shared that mindset.

\*\*\*

The caravan proceeded without any issues for several hours, and the
first break soon arrived. They pulled the carriages and horses to a
clearing by the roadside, a spot that showed signs of frequent use, and
paused.

"Agh... Good grief, traveling by carriage isn't easy when you get to my
age."

Letty approached Dominique as she got off the carriage and was
stretching her back. "Surprising. You do have parts that match your
age."

"What's that supposed to mean? I'm human, too. Things like this happen."

Dominique's tone was one of exasperation, mixed with a slight
petulance—perhaps a sign of guilt for realizing her own age. In any
case, she stretched out her back, regained her usual composure, and gave
a light shoulder roll.

"Well, then, after a short rest, how about a quick spar?"

"Alright, then, about five minutes?"

"You're so young... Give me ten minutes to sit down, and then we'll go."

"Hm, then I'll rest until then."

Letty turned on her heel and walked towards Ellie. As she did, she felt
various gazes.

Among the guards in the caravan, some had been present the other day,
but a few were entirely new. To them, the women were just oddballs who
took advantage of the employer's excessive trust—a potential source of
discontent. Especially an old woman running the show and the two being
treated specially by being allowed to ride horses.

Letty ignored the stares completely and continued forward. ...It seemed
there was no one skilled enough to perceive anything from the way she
walked. She felt confident that if they tried to pick a fight, she could
handle it. She soon reached the spot where Ellie was sitting.

"I'm back."

"Welcome back, Letty-san. Aren't you going to practice?"

"No, she wants to rest a little first. She seems tired from sitting."

"Ah, I see. So even Dominique-san is human after all."

"...Fufu, I said the exact same thing."

She wondered what kind of face Dominique would make if she found out
that a sentient magical weapon had just said that, but she swallowed the
urge to bring it up. As she sat down next to Ellie, a cup was gently
offered to her.

"Thank you."

"No, no, it’s nothing."

Letty took a sip from the cup. Immediately, her eyebrow twitched. She
swallowed and took another sip. This time, she savored it slowly with
her entire tongue. After fully appreciating it, she swallowed and let
out a sigh of contentment.

"Ellie, what is this?"

"Ehehe, I mixed honey with water and added a little lemon juice. Do you
like it?"

"Yes, very much... I think it's delicious."

"Fufu, I'm glad."

Upon seeing the beaming smile on Letty’s face, Ellie also broke into a
bright smile. Internally, she was doing a full-power fist pump.

Without realizing how pleased Ellie was, Letty continued to drink
carefully, savoring every sip. No matter how slowly she drank it,
though, it was bound to run out. As she looked at the cup with a
disappointed expression, Ellie pulled out her canteen.

"I have more. Would you like a refill?"

"Please."

The response was immediate. Ellie once again internally pumped her fist.

The central plains, where the wind lightly dances and passes by.

Something runs more lightly and sharply than that wind.

It dances with a dry sound.

Up Next: Swordplay on the Plains

Is it the wind, a storm, or the work of man?
