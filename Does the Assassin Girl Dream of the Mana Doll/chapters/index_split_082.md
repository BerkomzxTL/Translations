## Chapter 105: A Winter’s Morning—Departure Day

She took a deep breath.

It was the next morning, before the sun had risen. Letty’s day began.
The first thing she saw as she opened her eyes was Ellie's face up
close. Closer than she remembered from before falling asleep. It felt a
little embarrassing. She didn't recall hugging her or intertwining their
legs, but she didn't mind this closeness.

A sweet and flowery scent tickled her nose—Ellie's scent. Lately,
secretly smelling Ellie's scent while she slept had become a guilty
pleasure of hers. With every breath, a warmth spread through her chest
and radiated through her body.

It was a feeling of being recharged, both in body and mind.

What should she call such an emotion? Surely Ellie would be able to put
a name to it, but she felt too embarrassed to ask. So, she always just
indulged in it secretly.

She found herself staring at Ellie's face. Defenseless, and slightly
childlike. ...*Didn’t she say she’d stay on the lookout last night?*
Letty didn’t mind the sight before her, so she decided to stay silent
about the matter.

She wanted to keep looking at her forever, but the view outside the
window was getting brighter. It was almost time to get up. It was
unfortunate, but she had to wake her up. Truly unfortunate.

"Ellie, wake up. It's almost time."

"Mmmnya.. Ah, L-Letty-san... good morning..."

*Cute.* She thought. Letty wanted to hug her, but she managed to stop
herself. "Come on, pull yourself together. We have to go to work today."

"I know... *hwaa*…” She let out a big yawn. “I had a hard time falling
asleep last night."

When Ellie shifted her body, the ticklish sensation made Letty move as
well.

Yes. Letty, who was trying to wake her up, wasn't out of bed yet
herself. Ellie realized this shortly after getting her bearings, but she
had no intention of pointing it out.

As a result of their mutual unspoken agreement, their back-and-forth
about getting up or staying in bed continued for a while.

\*\*\*

No matter their feelings, they couldn't be late for their appointment.
To make it on time, both of them reluctantly got out of bed and began to
get ready.

Letty casually slipped off her shirt and folded it neatly so that it
took up as little space as possible. Feeling a stare, she turned to
Ellie.

"Ellie? Is something wrong?"

"Oh, no. It's just. You seem to have put on a little weight since
before."

"...Really?"

Letty looked down at her arms. They were still thin and her muscles were
prominent, but now that Ellie mentioned it, she thought they might be a
little thicker than before.

"If it's muscle, that's fine. As long as it doesn't slow me down."

"Oh, that's your reaction... That's just like you, Letty-san."

Ellie sounded dumbfounded, causing Letty to tilt her head.

*What other reaction should I have?* She wondered.

Ellie thought about how much she should tell her. Depending on what she
said, Letty might end up developing a certain kind of allure, but that
would attract all sorts of troublesome people. But it was a terrible
waste for her to be so oblivious.

While Ellie was fighting this internal battle, Letty had already put on
her clothes.

"Ellie, aren't you cold like that?"

"Huh? Oh, y-yes! I'm changing now."

Ellie hurriedly took off her pajamas and began to change, thinking again
about the way Letty looked a moment ago. She decided to be more forward.

"Um, Letty-san."

"Hm, what is it?"

"Next time, could I draw you naked?!"

Yes, for the sake of progressing her art skills. It would be good
practice. She tried to push for it with such a grand justification. But—

"Huh? No. It's too cold to be naked."

Letty blinked once, then refused flatly. Merciless and blunt.

"No way! Then, then, when it gets warmer, then!"

"Why are you so desperate... That's weird."

Letty was dumbfounded. But perhaps she felt sorry for how dejected Ellie
looked, because she gave a small smile.

"Fine, I'll think about it when it gets warmer."

As soon as she said that, Ellie's head snapped up.

"You said it! I heard you! You have to, you have to!"

Ellie's evident desperation made her smile wryly. She felt the
temptation to do a little mischief.

"Right, I said I'll *think* about it."

"N-no! But, but there's still a chance!"

Watching Ellie's expression rapidly shift between joy and dejection,
Letty almost felt like she should seriously consider it. But in the end,
she chose not to elaborate any further.

\*\*\*

Despite all the chaos, they got ready and reached the meeting spot right
on time, proving that they could still be professional despite their
behavior. When they arrived at the merchant's shop, the merchant and
Dominique were already waiting for them.

"Ah, good morning, you two. Thank you so much for coming."

"Morning, girls. So, Egret, have you made a decision?"

They each returned the greetings of the two who had waited for them.
When Dominique asked her, Letty hesitated for a moment, feeling the
slight shadiness of Dominique anew, but—

"Yes, I've decided. I want to learn your swordsmanship."

She spoke clearly, looking straight at Dominique. Immediately,
Dominique's confident smile transformed into true delight. She clapped
her hands together and rubbed them.

"Alright, it's settled! Then I'll be sure to teach you everything
properly. You'd better keep up. Ah, Mr. Merchant, you don't mind if I
have a little sparring session with Egret during our breaks, do you? Of
course, we'll do our guard duties properly, and as a bonus, you'll get
to see something good. It's a great deal."

"Of course. I am well aware of the skills of you three, and I know you
will do your jobs properly. And it's only natural for me to talk about
what I'll see and hear at taverns or with my business partners, right?"

"Hahaha, you're a shrewd one, aren't you? I like that!"

They seemed to have hit it off perfectly, leaving Letty feeling some
kind of lingering regret.

She glanced at Ellie standing next to her and shrugged. As long as she
had her by her side, everything would be alright. Probably.

That's what she thought at the time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A jumble of luggage. A noisy crowd.

Here, there is a microcosm of human life.

And also, their way of life and their pride.
