## Chapter 135: The Banquet is in Full Swing

"Princess Tseren is so serious\\ But I'm sure that's part of her charm.
Oh, of course, Letty-san is number one, right? Right?"

Ellie, who had been wrestling with the meat dish, interrupted the
conversation. She also gave Letty's arm a tight squeeze. *What kind of
appeal is this…?* Letty wondered.

Tseren, far from being annoyed by the interruption, smiled happily.
"Fufu, I don't know if I'm charming, but thank you for the compliment.
Ellie-sama, are you enjoying the food?"

"Yes, very much! As expected, the cuisine here is really delicious\\
Especially this mutton stew! It was the best!" Ellie gestured towards a
large platter.

...A large platter that now contained only broth.

"Ellie?"

"Yes? What is it, Letty-san?"

Letty's gaze shifted back to the platter. And then to another platter
that similarly contained only sauce.

"If my memory serves me correctly, there should have been large cuts of
meat on these two platters..."

"Was there? Then I'm sure everyone else ate them too."

Avoiding eye contact, Ellie picked up her glass with a straight face.
Sometime during the conversation, it had been refilled not with the
previous arkhi, but with the distilled version.

Letty watched her for a while, a look of reprimand on her face, but then
let out a sigh. "Well, it's fine, but... try not to drink too much,
okay?"

"Okaaay, I'll be fine\\"

"That is the answer of a person who is definitely not fine..."

Beside Letty, who let out another sigh, Tseren was giggling softly.

"Fufu, this is funny. Ellie-sama, who is usually the wife taking care of
Egret-sama, is now being taken care of instead."

"Ehehe, well, Letty-san is very kind\\"

"Indeed. I think you have a wonderful husband."

"No, I'm neither kind nor wonderful..."

As Letty sat sandwiched between the two excited women with a troubled
look, she caught sight of a large male figure in the corner of her eye.
Turning to look, she saw none other than King Batbayar walking towards
them, a glass in his hand.

"Hey hey, mind if I join you!" He raised a hand and plopped down
opposite Letty and the others.

Seeing her father, Tseren chuckled. "My my, Father, you're quite
cheerful... Was your conversation with Dominique-sama that much fun?"

"Ah, as expected, she has the wisdom of age!” Despite the distance,
Dominique briefly glared in their direction. “...And the ears of a
demon, that sister. She has so many stories, it's unbelievable!"

Batbayar laughed with great amusement, shrugging his shoulders in mock
fear. Actions that would be lèse-majesté in other countries seemed
trivial before this king.

"So, I wanted to hear the stories of her apprentice and her companion,
and that's why I've come over here. You all can drink too, right? Here,
how about a glass?"

Letty's eyes widened slightly as he offered the bottle.

"Eh? Eh, isn't it customary for you to be served, Your Majesty...?"

"Haha, that's true over there. But this way, it’s less likely for me to
be poisoned, isn’t it? Ah, I'm not suspecting you, mind you. It's just
common sense."

"I-I see...?"

The king thrust the bottle closer to Letty as she nodded with a mixed
expression of understanding and confusion. She reluctantly took the
glass in both hands to receive the pour.

"Now, the young lady over there, too. Ellie, was it?"

"Yes, I'm Ellie\\ Thank you very much\\"

Batbayar poured a generous amount for the cheerfully smiling Ellie, his
own mood improving even more.

"Whoa... excuse me."

Ellie brought the overflowing glass to her lips, and though she felt a
little unrefined, she took a mouthful. The strong alcoholic scent, which
she had grown completely accustomed to, was rather comforting.

"Phew, the alcohol poured by His Majesty is exceptional\\ ♪"

"Oh, what a nice thing to say! Keep drinking!"

"Ahaha, thank you\\ ♪"

Whether he liked Ellie's flattery or her drinking style, Batbayar's mood
brightened further. He poured a drink for himself and took a swig.

"Hah! Alcohol tastes good when you drink with beautiful women. Come on,
Egret, you have a drink too."

"Ah, um, yes..."

She lifted the glass to her mouth as prompted, drinking with more vigor
than usual, perhaps influenced by the atmosphere of the two others.

"You're a good drinker too! I like you!" Batbayar, in turn, finished his
glass, emptying it in one gulp. He then set the glass down on the table
with a *thunk*. "So, I heard from Big Sis Dominique that Ellie is
Egret's wife, that right?"

"Wuh?" Startled by the sudden statement, Letty let out a silly sound.

"Yees, that's right\\ ♪" But Ellie replied with delight while still
clinging to her arm.

Seeing this, Batbayar nodded in satisfaction. "Things are pretty
advanced over there, huh?"

"I wonder if that's the right reaction..." Letty scrutinized his face.
*He looks fine, but maybe he’s drunk?*

While she was doing this, Batbayar abruptly slapped his knee.

"Alright then! Since that's the case, why don't you take Tseren as your
wife too?"

"Wuh?" "What did you say?" "Father!?"

Letty's eyes went wide, Ellie became serious, and Tseren was shocked.
The words were too sudden; the three of them spoke simultaneously,
unable to continue.

Into the silence, Batbayar, still in high spirits and unperturbed, began
to speak.

"Well, talking with Big Sis Dominique, I realized that the person I
marry my daughter off to doesn't have to be a man! I asked her first,
but she refused, saying she was too old. So, I figured, why not Egret?
In our country, polygamy isn't a problem legally, even with two wives!"

"Wait, there's a huge problem. To begin with, I'm not a man."

"Huh? Ah, that's right... Well, what does it matter? Don't sweat the
small stuff! So, what do you say?"

Letty, unsure whether to be dumbfounded or what to do at all, blinked a
few times.

"What do I say... well, um. I have Ellie, and I can't accept anyone
other than Ellie. I apologize to Princess Tseren, but..." She hesitated
at first, a little embarrassed, but then stated her refusal clearly.

Hearing her words, Ellie's grip on her arm tightened considerably.
Tseren put both hands to her mouth, smiling happily... then checked the
expressions of Letty and Ellie alternately, as if gauging their mood.

After having his offer turned down, Batbayar slapped his forehead with a
*smack*. "Aww, too bad! What a waste! The courage to speak your mind
like that right in front of me—if only you were willing, I would have
insisted!"

"Honestly, Father, with you saying such strange things, it looks like
*I* was the one who was rejected! Those two share an unbreakable, strong
bond..."

"Wait, hold on, something is definitely wrong here."

*Why is the one who made the offer and the one who was rejected both so
happy?* Letty had so many things she wanted to point out.

"Le-Letty-saaan... I, I..."

But she couldn’t bring herself to retort.

Face flushed, eyes moist and languid, she crumbled under Ellie’s stare.
As Letty stroked her head to calm her, Ellie's expression softened
further. She suddenly felt the alcohol rushing to her own head.

Exposed to such a sensation, Letty could only stare at the two cheerful
royals with a bewildered expression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The noise fades away, and the intoxication and warmth draws closer.

Darkness in a foreign land, intertwined breaths.

Her heart’s resolution under the gaze seeking her out.

Up Next: And Then, the Two

Crossing the night, and beyond.
