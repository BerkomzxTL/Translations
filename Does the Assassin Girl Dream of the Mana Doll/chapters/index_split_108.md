## Chapter 131: A Moment of Respite

Dominique said something unnecessary, Letty brushed it off, and Ellie
smiled sheepishly. Engaging in such banter, they returned to the
merchant guild, where the unloading of cargo had long been finished.

"Oh, you're back.” The merchant who greeted the three approached them
with an extremely cheerful face. “Princess Tseren is safe, then?"

"Ah, of course she is. And speaking of which..." Dominique briefly
explained her conversation with the magistrate at the main gate and
informed him that an envoy from the royal castle might be coming.

The merchant nodded as if it were obvious. "The King of Cordor is a
generous and personable man. Since you are Princess Tseren's saviors,
such a development is to be expected."

"Hmm, with Princess Tseren and all, is that a tradition of the Cordor
royal family?"

"Oh?” The merchant pondered the meaning of Dominique's words for a
moment. “...Dominique-san, could it be that you’re familiar with the
previous generation?"

"Ah, well, yes. Though, that was quite a while ago." Dominique answered
his question casually, as if it were nothing.

The merchant nodded several times, looking satisfied.

"I see. It's not strange at all for you, Dominique-san, to have such
connections."

"I know I shouldn't say this myself, but how inhuman do I seem to be to
you, boss?"

"You are one of the most monstrous people I've ever seen."

"What kind of way is that to put it? I'm a lady, you know."

She poked the merchant, laughing, as she talked back to him, though he
didn't seem remorseful. She genuinely liked him, and she enjoyed this
kind of exchange. That sentiment must have been conveyed as well, as he
looked delighted.

"Yes, of course, you are a wonderful lady. And a fearless and invincible
one as well."

"Are you trying to compliment me? Well, that sounds like me."

"Of course," the merchant replied cheerfully to the laughing Dominique.

\*\*\*

"Well, though we could talk endlessly, let's head to the inn soon. To
those staying over, thank you for your continued help."

The merchant bowed his head to the guards. The luggage had already been
transported, and while they didn't need excessive guarding, it was a
precaution. And it was an excuse to offer payment. Since he put out a
call, a decent number of people gathered, and the security of the shop
was perfect. The remaining members could rest without worry.

Of course, Letty and Ellie were among those staying at the inn.

"Ah, Dominique-san, Egret-san, and Ellie-san. I was thinking of
suggesting a different inn for the ladies. What do you think?"

"As always, how thoughtful of you. What do you say, Egret, Ellie?"

Dominique nodded at the thoughtful merchant's question and turned to
them. After thinking for a few seconds, Letty nodded.

"I do think that would be more relaxing. It's not that I dislike them,
but..."

"Yes, I apologize, but I agree. And I also apologize for causing you so
much extra trouble..."

They figured that after a job well done, the men would likely be
celebrating boisterously at the inn's bar out of a sense of liberation.
They had no intention of denying them that, but they were certainly not
used to it. The events of the past week had left them more tired than
they realized.

Seeing the two women's expressions, Dominique nodded and, for just a
moment, gave a malicious grin.

"Then, the two of you will stay at a different inn. I'm in the mood to
have a drink with the boys, so I don't mind staying with them."

"Understood, we'll arrange that."

Dominique and the merchant settled the matter quickly, with a silent
understanding, as if they had planned it. This caused Letty and Ellie to
panic.

"Uh, wait, Dominique, you're staying with them?"

"What, does it matter where I stay? Or are you worried without me there
to lead you?"

"That's certainly not the case, but..."

"I don't know, it feels like favoritism, with just the two of us being
separated..."

Though they spoke up, their words were dripping with reluctance.
Dominique laughed seeing their all too transparent reactions.

"Come on, don't worry about such minor details. If anyone complains,
I'll silence them, okay?"

She turned to the guards, who were looking their way, wondering what was
happening. Those who had overheard nodded, and those who hadn't also
nodded. She nodded once, satisfied, then turned back to Letty and her
companion.

"See? No problem, right?"

"...I feel like there's a huge problem, but... fine..."

She knew that arguing further would be useless against Dominique. That
was something she had learned well from her recent experiences.

"Yes, you two were particularly instrumental. Please, relax and enjoy
yourselves."

Letty didn't want to believe there was any hidden meaning in the
merchant's words as he spoke with a smile.

\*\*\*

At any rate, they were guided to their inn. Even for the royal capital,
it was fairly high-class. The appearance, atmosphere, and even the
street outside were quiet.

"I leave these two in your capable hands."

"Yes, sir, you may leave it to me."

It seemed the merchant really did have connections, or at least a good
relationship, as he and the innkeeper spoke familiarly. The room they
were shown to was one of the best they offered.

"Please, enjoy your rest," the innkeeper said before departing, leaving
the two of them alone.

Yes, just the two of them.

"Let's just put down our luggage for now."

"Ah, yes."

They put down their bags, took off their outer clothes, hung them up,
and took a breath. Then, Ellie slowly approached her side. Right next to
her. Almost touching.

"...Letty-san."

"What is it, Ellie?"

"Our work is finished, isn't it?"

Her words somehow conveyed what she wanted to say, and Letty
involuntarily closed her mouth. She thought for a moment.

"Yes, it is finished."

"Then, we don't have to hold back anymore, do we?"

"Um... someone might come tomorrow, so maybe we should hold back a
little..."

A small caution. Almost cursory. A caution that seemed likely to be
instantly dismissed.

"But, the morning will probably be fine! So, come on, let's kiss! Let's
*chuu*! Come on, come on!" Saying that, Ellie pressed closer.

Letty was pushed back by her forcefulness, but she stood her ground,
determined not to be swept away. "I don't mind kissing, but... the way
you're saying it, the atmosphere, or something, is..."

"It doesn't matter! Momentum is important for these things! Come on!"
She pressed closer again, causing Letty to make a troubled face.

Of course, Letty *did* want to, too.

"Honestly... you talk about momentum..."

She gave a single disclaimer.

She leaned in.

And forcefully grazed Ellie's lips.

"...See? Is a kiss like this okay too?"

She peered closely into Ellie's face as she asked. Ellie, who had looked
stunned for a moment, suddenly turned bright red. Fiddling with her
hair, she looked up at Letty.

"Um, it's not that I dislike it, I mean... I actually think this kind of
forceful approach might be… nice."

Hearing that, Letty suddenly froze, as if a switch had been flipped.
Ellie peered at the unmoving Letty with a worried expression.

"Oh, Letty-san? What's wrong? ...Ah, kyah! Ahh, *mmph*!"

Without warning, Letty embraced Ellie and rather forcefully took her
lips. The arms that squeezed her were more assertive than usual. The
kiss that followed was almost rough, a perfect embodiment of the word
‘taking’. It was a kiss that one would never have expected from the
usual Letty. And she repeated the strong, sucking kisses many times.

"...Hah…” Finally, seemingly calmed down, she pulled her lips away. “Is
this kind of thing okay, too?"

"*Huff*, a-ah... um... more than okay, I mean... I think I'm going to
get addicted..." Ellie, whose face was bright red, whispered this amidst
her ragged breaths.

Although she had been using what little remained of her rationality to
hold back, Letty couldn't help but embrace Ellie again. Pushed by the
force, Ellie stumbled and was pressed against the wall. Trapped between
Letty and the wall, with nowhere to escape, her lips were taken again
and again.

Her head was spinning, and her legs felt weak, but the restraint didn't
allow her to collapse. Paradoxically, the act felt like it was filling
something in her heart.

"Letty-san..."

"...What is it?"

"I think... I might actually like this..."

Because Ellie said such a thing, Letty transformed into a Kissing
Monster, and the two ended up missing dinner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sudden invitation is, so to speak, a declaration of challenge.

Stepping into that public forum is a maiden's battle.

And what’s more, when the two are equally oblivious, it’s unavoidable.

Up Next: A Maiden's Preparations

A battle that must be won.
