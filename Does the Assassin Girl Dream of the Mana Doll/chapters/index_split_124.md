## Chapter 147: Message from the Past

...Ellie was enveloped in light.

Not just her body, but her thoughts as well.

Though her eyes were closed, there was a sensation of being wrapped in a
warm light. Nothing was visible, yet there was a sense of reassurance
that banished all fear.

She recognized this sensation. It was the feeling of maintenance… Though
it had been a very long time since the "usual." It was a time when her
Self was bleached and cleansed of impurities.

Yet, this time, something was different. Ever so slightly. Both on the
outside and the inside. Something warmer and more definite. She found
herself gently holding onto it.

*It's alright. It's alright. I will return.*

She whispered softly. The process had entered the memory data
preservation phase. Soon, her consciousness would fade. Even so, it
would surely be alright.

*I will definitely return.*

In the replacement of the information processing circuit, memory loss
was a non-negligible risk. It wasn’t considered a major issue if the
memory of a Mana Doll, a weapon and a tool, was lost. So it wasn’t
prioritized. After all, as long as new master information was simply
installed, the weapon would be functional. That was why, when she met
Letty, most of her personal memories had been lost. And she felt no
problem with that; there was no problem.

But now, it was different.

She didn't want to forget.

She must not forget.

She had a mountain of such memories piled up. One by one, she traced
through their journey so far, checking each and every one. These were
treasures, she was sure. That's why she didn't want to forget them, and
she wouldn't.

*It's alright. Because I have...*

The face of the most precious person, her beloved, floated up. She was
etched into her being. In her memory. And in her body. So, she would
surely not forget.

*I'll be back right away.*

Although her eyes were closed. Although she had no sensation left. For
some reason, she felt her gaze strongly. She smiled softly.

Ellie's consciousness was swallowed by the light.

\*\*\*

*Ring... ring...* She thought she heard the sound of a bell somewhere
far away. The central processing unit shouldn't have started its reboot
yet.

But beyond the vague consciousness

She was aware of her unconscious self.

*...Is this a dream?*

Surely a foolish thought. There was no reason to equip her, a weapon,
with such a function. Yet, a scene was currently unfolding before her
that could only be a dream. A scene she hadn’t seen before, but at the
same time somehow felt like she had.

*"Why, why! Why won't it work on her!"*

A hysterical voice echoed. No, a memory of the voice echoed. One she
didn't recognize.

*"As I thought, this won't work as is. You knew about the magical
efficiency problem, didn't you?"*

*"I know that, but what are we supposed to do? We've tried this, we've
tried that, but not a single thing has improved!"*

Two people were arguing. She didn't recognize either of them, but at the
same time there was a strange sense of nostalgia.

*"There's one thing we haven't tried yet. This is just my hypothesis,
but..."*

*"That’s fine, tell me. I can't afford to be picky anymore. I'll do
anything to defeat him!"*

*"...Will you promise not to hit me?"*

*"What is that supposed to mean?"*

*"It's probably a ridiculously foolish attempt. You can laugh, but I'd
rather not be hit."*

One of them probably laughed. With a terribly tired face. And the other
was exasperated. With an equally tired face.

*"Fine, just tell me already."*

*"Yes, well, actually..."*

Suddenly, the voices faded away.

A physical sensation, like being rapidly pulled back.

\[Central processing unit reconnected. Restarting. Checking system
version information. Commencing version update.\]

Her consciousness was pulled back. What she heard was likely something
that actually happened. And the massive amount of information flooding
into her mind… It was being organized, forming meaningful structures.

More importantly.

She had returned.

"Letty-san..."

That was the first thing she murmured.

It was alright. She hadn't lost her memory.

\[Version update complete. Commencing normal operation of System Version
3.6.2. System operational check.\]

Urged by that voice, a huge amount of information flowed into her mind:
Speeding up the fire control function. Strengthening the search
function. Organizing the status detection function.

She could distinctly feel Letty looking at her.

*I'll be back in just a moment.*

She told herself this mentally while waiting for the process to finish.

\[System operational check complete. Normal operation confirmed.\]

Suddenly, even more information flooded in: Status of physical body
functions—98% of peak condition; the current state was extremely good.
An announcement that the Mana Bolt targeting function had been restored.
Improvement in the Mana Blaster adjustment capability.

And, most importantly…

*What is this?*

Output Correction +250%.

*Wait. Seriously, what is this?*

There was no one to answer her confusion. The various processing
circuits integrated, and she returned to her usual state... No, a state
where her consciousness was even clearer than before.

\[All procedures complete. Thank you for your hard work.\]

With that, she sat up almost reflexively.

"Ellie!"

She turned with a smile at the sound of the voice of her beloved.

"I'm back, Letty-san."

Savoring the happiness of being able to call that name once more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A past that cannot be wiped away. A past that does not fade.

Piling past upon past, they are here now.

If called a sin, so be it. They are here nonetheless.

Up Next: Hand in Hand

Their steps are toward the future.
