## Chapter 113: Like Flowing Water

"Now then, whether I teach Ellie or not will be decided after Egret's
training is over. Let's get started, shall we?"

"O-okay. Ellie, we’ll talk later."

For a few seconds, Letty glared resentfully at Dominique for stirring
things up and then acting completely oblivious. Of course, Dominique
wasn't one to be bothered by such a thing. With the excited Ellie now
standing down, Letty straightened her posture and readied herself again.

"Alright. Back to footwork. After the proper stance I mentioned earlier,
this is the next step. The image to have in your head is walking on the
ground as if gliding on the surface of water. Ah, I'll teach you the
specific technique later, so for now, just keep that image in mind."

“Eh?” Seeing her tilt her head, Dominique laughed and waved her hand
lightly. *Ah, a metaphor*, Letty realized belatedly, nodding in
understanding and returning to her listening posture.

"So, the image of gliding is to move with your opponent, never sticking
to them, never separating, flowing without stopping or stagnating. If
you or I were to stop our feet and try to exchange blows, we'd easily be
blown away. Of course, you could parry with your sword, but stopping
your feet sets a limit. You must always strive for a superior position
relative to your opponent.

“It goes without saying that the opponent's flank is advantageous, not
just their back. And surprisingly, there are other places where it's
difficult for them to strike you. That's also part of what to look for."

As she spoke continuously, Letty observed Dominique in admiration as she
truly flowed without stopping or stagnating. She was impressed, not only
by how much she could talk but also by the consideration behind the
technique.

"I see, I think I understand the point you're trying to make and what
you want me to do. Is it correct to say that to have the presence of
mind to think about an unfavorable position for your opponent, you first
have to be able to walk without thinking?"

"Yes, that's right, but... your understanding is too quick. I mean...
no, it's fine."

Dominique sounded exasperated, but that too could be taken as
confirmation. Her first impression was that Letty wasn't very good at
thinking for herself, but this was a pleasant surprise.

"Now for the specific method. Normally, when you change direction, you
stop for a moment, and then you kick the ground in the direction you
want to go. But that inevitably stops your movement for a second. So
what do you do? This."

With that, Dominique stepped forward. A simple, light motion. No
preparation, no effort, as natural as blinking. Watching from the side,
it took Ellie a moment to register that she had moved. Letty, who could
move almost as quickly, was able to react, but...

The next instant—

Without stopping. Dominique moved to the left as if flowing. To Letty,
who was watching from close up, it almost looked like she had vanished
for a split second. She barely managed to follow her with her eyes.

When she looked over, Dominique was already starting to flow further to
the left. The confident, smug grin that flashed for an instant was
incredibly irritating. As Letty tried to chase, Dominique suddenly moved
to the right. Letty quickly switched her gaze, only for Dominique to
mock her by moving left again.

Letty managed to keep up for a little longer, but Dominique completely
shook her off. When she moved behind her, Letty raised both hands in
defeat.

“I give up. I can’t keep up with you.”

"...Um, wait, what?? What just happened? My brain is refusing to
understand this."

Dominique looked at the slightly frustrated Letty and the utterly
confused Ellie and smirked with satisfaction.

"Well, that's the level I want you to reach. And as for how I did it,
Egret, did you grasp anything?"

Taken aback by the sudden question, Letty stopped moving, then started
to think. The movement she had just witnessed, and what she had said up
to this point. Putting them together, she arrived at a single deduction.

"A change of direction without kicking the ground. An image of floating,
without putting your weight on your feet. You changed direction by
rotating your body axis without letting it waver. ...But I don't know
how."

"Wait, you figured all that out in that instant!?"

Ellie exclaimed in surprise hearing Letty's composed deduction. But
Dominique just laughed with great amusement.

"That's impressive, even with all the hints I gave you. And as for how I
did it, it's simple once you know the trick."

Saying that, she moved away from Letty to a distance where her feet were
clearly visible. She executed the same flowing step and sudden change of
direction as before. After seeing it from afar, Letty snapped her
fingers.

"I see! You twisted the foot you stepped with. You evaded to the right
just now, but you twisted your stepping foot 90 degrees to the left as
you stepped in."

By doing that, rotating her body 90 degrees counter-clockwise while
pulling her left foot back, she could evade to the right while keeping
her body facing Letty. The mechanism itself was simple. The *mechanism*.

"Correct. It's just that simple," Dominique laughed as if it were an
easy feat.

"No, no,” Ellie interjected with a deadpan look. “If a normal person did
that at that speed, they would sprain their ankle!"

Letty, who had received the explanation, remained silent for a moment in
thought, then opened her mouth.

"A sprain is one thing, but... you're deciding the direction of the turn
the moment you step, right? Doesn't that mean you need to predict what
will happen next, or something like that?"

"Oh my, if you figure out that much, there's no fun in explaining it
anymore. That's right. And that's exactly the part you're lacking. So
eventually, we'll talk about pre-reading and planning how to break an
opponent's posture. But all of that is for later, after you can move
without even thinking about it. So, mastering this is the first step."

"Th-this is only the first step... Wait, how far are we going?"

To Ellie, a novice in swordsmanship, being able to do that already
looked like a divine skill. Hearing that it was merely a preliminary
step made her look at Dominique as if she were seeing something
terrifying.

"Well, until you can get behind most people, I suppose. Because once you
can use it, you can do this, too."

Dominique stepped toward Letty again, then—

*Swoosh.*

In an instant, she slipped past and was already standing behind her.

"...Huh?"

"I see, a 180-degree twist with the step... That's also an option. But
it requires a lot of practice and flexibility, doesn't it?"

"That's the gist of it. So, for a while, we're going to be rigorously
practicing footwork, alright?"

"Yes, I welcome it."

Letty had been cleanly outmaneuvered from behind even though she wasn't
letting her guard down. In response to Dominique’s challenging look of
"Can you do it?", Letty nodded, her eyes full of defiance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crossing swords. Adapting, deflecting, and thrusting in accordance with
the opponent.

An exchange, akin to a conversation.

It flows without stagnation.

Up Next: Intuited Blade

To the point where it looks strange to outsiders.
