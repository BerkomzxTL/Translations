## Chapter 114: Intuited Blade

"Well, now that I’ve finished explaining the footwork, let's move on to
the other thing. The one I called grappling practice. We'll mainly use
swords for this."

"...Swords… mainly? Not just 'using a sword'?"

Letty tilted her head after hearing Dominique's unique choice of words.
Dominique responded with a wry, exasperated smile.

"What is it with you being so perceptive? Were you extremely
well-trained? Fine, whatever. Yes, we won't just be using swords, but
it’ll be the central focus. You've been waiting for this, but I'm afraid
it's probably not what you're imagining."

"This is already way off from what I originally expected... I thought
this swordsmanship practice would be more flashy."

Dominique burst out laughing at Ellie's complaint.

"Well, people tend to think that, and the flashy, brilliant techniques
are what people actually want. But mine are techniques for survival, and
Egret, that's what you want, right?"

Really, it was a confirmation, not a question. Facing Dominique's look
of confidence, Letty nodded in agreement.

"Yes, that's exactly right. I want to learn swordsmanship as a means to
achieve my goals."

"Good answer. So, for both me and Egret, swordsmanship is a means and a
tool. Of course, there are others who make swordsmanship the purpose of
their lives, and I don't mean to belittle them. That's just a difference
in philosophy. And practical tools are often plain, aren't they? Though
they possess a certain functional beauty."

"When you put it that way, I want to say that makes sense... But with
you, Dominique-san, I feel like I'm about to be sweet-talked into
something."

Her reasoning was sound, her delivery smooth, and that was precisely why
Ellie was wary. Of course, she didn't sense any malice from her. But if
Dominique were trying to deceive her, Ellie had no confidence in her
ability to see through it.

"Haha, what a harsh thing to say. Well, I get told that a lot. I'll be
sure to earn your trust over time. With that said, let's get down to
what we're going to do. Egret, assume a normal stance with your wooden
sword."

"Hmm, understood. Like this?"

Letty obediently followed the instruction, cutting off the casual talk.

She stood in her diagonal stance, right foot forward, back straight,
right hand extended, the tip of the wooden sword pointed precisely at
Dominique's throat. There was nothing forced about the stance, with no
hint of imbalance in her center of gravity, ready to move forward,
backward, left, or right at any moment.

Dominique nodded once, approvingly.

"Yes, that's a well-balanced stance. And I'll stand like this. Now, I'm
going to slowly thrust at your chest, so just take it as it is."

"Eh? Okay."

Dominique faced her with a perfect half-body stance, presenting her
right flank to Letty. Her practice sword was similarly aimed at Letty's
throat. Their wooden swords were positioned so that the flat of their
blades were almost rubbing against each other.

As Dominique slowly extended her sword, it struck Letty squarely in the
center of her chest.

"See, if you do nothing, that's what happens. So, Egret, if I thrust at
you like this, what would you do?"

"Well, I'd deflect it, of course."

Dominique reset back to her original position, and when she thrusted
again in the same way, Letty parried it by sliding her wooden sword to
the left. Naturally, the strike was deflected past Letty's chest and
missed.

"Good, I figured you'd do that. In that case, I'll return the favor like
this."

Dominique thrust again, Letty deflected it, and then Dominique's wooden
sword flowed along Letty's blade, circling to the right side of it
before striking her right forearm.

"...I think I'm starting to understand what you want. If you come at me
like that, I'll naturally counter like this."

Letty parried the strike to her right forearm by twisting her wrist, and
this time she tried to stab at Dominique's chest in a scooping motion.

"Exactly. And if you do that, I'll counter like this."

Dominique deflected Letty's counterattack by twisting her own arm to
suppress and evade the strike. As soon as she cleared it, she used the
blade to perform an upward cut and struck Letty's right shoulder, which
was exposed by her broken posture.

The two continued to move, rambling back and forth while countering each
other, when they were interrupted by a voice—

"Um, both of you? You've completely entered your own world, but what is
with that creepy looking smooth movement that you’re doing so
naturally?"

"Huh? Creepy?"

"I'm sorry, Letty-san, but honestly, my brain is refusing to comprehend
how you can continue to move in such a flowy way."

"Haha, that's a harsh way to put it. But I suppose it’s only natural to
feel that way when you only understand things to a certain degree. The
goal of this practice is to break the opponent's posture and land a
single blow by reading each other's movements and breathing."

As Dominique explained with a slight grin, Ellie thought for a moment
and then spoke.

"If that's the goal, then what is the purpose or the aim?"

"Oh, my, aren’t you also a little too perceptive?" Dominique smiled
happily at Ellie's question. “Egret, what do you think the aim is?”
Then, she deliberately deflected to Letty.

After pondering for a moment, Letty opened her mouth, "The obvious
answer would be to acquire defensive techniques by reading the
opponent's breathing and movements. If we go a step further, it's
connected to offensive techniques that allow us to break the opponent's
posture after defending and landing a counterattack."

"That's so spot-on it's almost laughable. But yes, that's essentially
it. You can have a proper tactical exchange even at a speed that won't
cause injury if you get hit. In fact, I think that's where the
difference in skill is most apparent. It's training to intuitively learn
the ability to control your opponent, the tactical exchange, and how to
break their balance."

"I see. So it’s a matter of intuition, to understand and move without
having to think about it…"

"That's right. The only way to master something like this is to do it
repeatedly."

However, Letty's high level of understanding couldn’t be overlooked. At
the very least, she seemed to be able to follow everything that had been
discussed so far, both logically and intuitively.

"And once you master the footwork and get used to this, then you'll move
like this..."

No sooner had she said that than Dominique circled around Letty's flank,
as if winding up Letty's sword, and, *tap tap,* lightly tapped her on
the forearm, then the shoulder.

"That kind of thing is the second step."

"Eh. Eh? That's *still* just the second step...?"

*There’s no end in sight...* That was all Ellie could think.

"I see, I understand the immediate goal. ...By the way, doesn't this
practice put me at a significant disadvantage? I think the difference in
the length of our swords is quite large."

As she spoke, Letty extended her wooden sword, comparing their lengths.
Dominique's, though held with one hand, could be classified as a
longsword and was easily 20 cm longer than the one made to match Letty's
short sword. That difference in reach seemed to further widen the
already existing gap in skill.

"Yes, of course it does. That's why it's good training."

"I can't deny that, but I feel... a sense of frustration, as if I've
been had..."

"Well, it's true I was a little mean. But if you're going to use that
short sword, there’s no avoiding this. So, you might as well get used to
it during practice, where you won't get hurt, right?"

"Mmm... that's certainly true." Letty was still a bit displeased, but
she nodded in general agreement.

Watching her, Ellie mumbled, "I have to say, this training is so focused
on defense that it's nothing like what I'd imagine from your aggressive
personality, Dominique-san."

"Hey, hey, that might be true, but can't you put it a bit nicer? Both
Egret and I use swords. A sword can't do anything if the strike doesn't
land. But if it does hit, even with our strength, it can cause injury or
death. And when it comes down to just landing a blow, Egret already has
the skills needed. So, the goal is to hit as efficiently as possible
while avoiding being hit."

Both Ellie and Letty looked impressed by her words.

"That's right... I'm sorry, Dominique-san, I truly respect you now for
the first time."

"Yes, I have a much clearer view of the direction I should be aiming
for."

"Ellie, that wasn't a compliment, was it? Well, never mind."

Feigned seriousness.

Diligence.

A bright smile.

The three, showing their various expressions, chatted for a while before
returning to their practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suddenly. It arrives far too suddenly.

Is it a difference in skill, or a difference in experience?

And it cannot be prevented.

Sometimes, it is sweet.
