# 260 Final Chapter -- "My Story" --

An unprecedented disaster befell the royal capital of the Claydale
Kingdom. In the rapidly recovering capital, multiple merchant guilds
invested their private funds to quickly reopen their stores, supporting
the lives of the people living in the capital.

<br />
Of course, not all of them are acting out of goodwill as they are
merchants, and there are many who are taking this opportunity to outdo
other merchant guilds and expand their sales channels in the capital, or
who are trying to gain connections with the royal family and upper
nobility. However, due to these circumstances, daily necessities and
food were sold at relatively low prices, and they were accepted by the
people of the capital.

<br />
However, not all of the stores were originally existing merchant guilds.
Although the number of victims was small compared to the damage, such as
passionate followers of the Holy Church, there were still merchants who
were engulfed in flames while trying to take out their household goods.
In the place of these merchants, people claiming to be relatives that no
one had ever seen before opened shops with the same names.

<br />
"......You know, instead of doing something so troublesome, we could
just do it directly."

In the basement of such a newly built merchant guild of unknown origin,
the middle-aged man claiming to be the guild master frowned at the rough
language of the man sitting on a wooden box.

"Are you still saying the same thing, Wolf?"

"Tch."

The dozen or so men and women in the room also looked at him with
similar glares, but Wolf didn't seem to mind their gazes and clicked his
tongue annoyingly. The guild master swallowed the sigh that was about to
escape him, and spoke again.

"As I've said many times, 'she' is in this kingdom."

<br />
The disaster that struck the royal capital—the attack of Greater Demons.

It is said that three Greater Demons, who appeared from somewhere, left
gruesome scars on the kingdom, and that two young girls defeated these
demons.

<br />
"One of them died, right? That means there's only one troublesome one
left."

It has been investigated that of the two girls who defeated the demons,
the black-haired girl died.

With the death of the black-haired girl, as well as the head court
magician, in the battle against the demons, the number of 【Rank 5】
individuals possessed by the Claydale Kingdom had decreased.

<br />
The goal of their dark organization from the Solhorse Kingdom was to
investigate the situation in the Claydale Kingdom...and to assassinate
the First Princess, who had become the new Crown Princess.

As far as the spies who had infiltrated in advance had investigated, the
First Princess's abilities were high enough to overturn her childhood
evaluations, and the upper echelons of the Solhorse Kingdom, who had
been using the First Prince's abilities as a standard, were thrown into
a panic.

The princess, who had ousted her brother with her abilities and
political skills and become the Crown Princess, had also been involved
in the previous destruction of a spy organization, and the upper
echelons, who saw the princess as a danger, decided to eliminate her by
taking advantage of the chaos caused by the demons destroying the
capital.

However, in the Claydale Kingdom, there is a girl said to be the
princess's right-hand woman, who defeated the demons. For that reason,
Wolf, one of the leading Rank 5s in the Solhorse Kingdom, was drafted
and participated in this operation.

Even so, it is a last resort for someone like Wolf to assassinate the
princess by force. If the princess were assassinated in such an obvious
way at this time, it would be difficult for everyone to escape the
capital alive, and it would escalate tensions between nations.

<br />
"......Tch."

Wolf, who had originally risen through the ranks with only his martial
prowess and was not a member of the underworld, didn't like that.

He was originally an adventurer, but his bad behavior stood out, and he
was about to be executed for killing a civilian, but he was saved by the
Solhorse dark organization, who valued his abilities. He has no
complaints about that, but Wolf, who has a high sense of self-respect,
is dissatisfied with the current situation where his abilities are not
being used.

(I'm the strongest...)

<br />
Wolf's overall combat power exceeds 2000, and he has a sense of pride
that he is the strongest among the Rank 5s in the Solhorse Kingdom.

That's why the "rumor" that the "girl" who defeated the Greater Demon,
even though they did it together, was the strongest irritated Wolf, and
that caused his emotional restraints to come undone.

"Just leave it all to me! Then I'll decorate Solhorse's royal castle
with the princess's head!"

"Wolf!"

The guild master raised his voice at Wolf, who had openly broken the
unspoken rule of not touching on direct topics even among comrades, at
that moment--

<br />
"--We've got the statement ."

<br />
In the basement where only comrades should be, a cool, young girl's
voice echoed.

"--tsu!"

At that moment, a female scout, one of their comrades, instantly
pinpointed the location of the "voice," took out a hidden weapon, and
attacked.

Her combat power, as a Rank 4, exceeds 1000. Even if she isn't on Wolf's
level, she should have been able to immediately dispose of an ordinary
spy.

\*Bokin\*...

The sound of snapping a dried branch wrapped in a wet cloth could be
heard, and the figure in a black coat, moving forward as if sliding and
disrupting one's senses, grabbed the woman's neck and snapped it in an
instant, reaping her life.

Tension ran through the members of the Solhorse Kingdom's dark
organization.

"Ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"

Among them, Wolf, without a moment's hesitation, let out a roar and
leaped out, wielding his twin swords.

<br />
(It's this one!)

The moment he saw her, Wolf understood that this was the "strong one,"
his enemy.

Intoxicated by the exhilaration of being able to fight a strong person
and the pleasure of surrendering to violence, Wolf's grip on the hilts
of his twin swords tightened.

"I'll kill (to) you!!"

The twin swords, swung down with the best timing and the best speed,
attacked the intruder. Impossible to dodge, impossible to block. But--

"What!?"

Slender hands extending from the coat deflected the twin swords as if
pushing them away with bare hands.

Wolf didn't know. No, even if he knew, he couldn't understand.

Combat power is just a guideline. No matter how high your stats are, no
matter how many honed techniques are engraved in your soul, the
experience gained in the space between life and death is only stored in
your heart.

<br />
The next moment, the young girl's lithe leg kicked up Wolf's chin, and
Wolf, who was pierced by the blade of her toes from under his chin,
collapsed without even being able to demonstrate his true ability,
without even realizing that he had died.

At the very end, Wolf's hand, which dropped his sword, grabbed the
intruder's coat. And the guild master, who witnessed the "pinkish-golden
hair" gleaming in the revealed darkness, widened his eyes as if he had
seen something unbelievable and muttered the name of the "strongest"
that spies in surrounding countries feared in a trembling voice.

<br />
"--Iron Rose Princess--"

<br />
   ＊＊＊

<br />
Half a year had passed since the battle and destruction in the royal
capital.

The damage to the capital was considerable, but with support not only
from the nation but also from multiple noble families, reconstruction
was progressing at a surprising pace.

This was under the leadership of Elena, who had become the new Crown
Princess, having secured the cooperation of the Fandora Theocracy, where
the Holy Church's main temple is located. Although it has not yet been
officially announced, she made her presence known to the nobles and the
people.

<br />
To be honest, there are parts about the Theocracy and the Holy Church
that I can't believe. But you have to swallow it and decide how far to
shake hands. That will change depending on political decisions.

The "Saintess" recognized by the Holy Church communicated with demons
and endangered even the royal family. The Holy Church was also a victim
in that regard, but they had no choice but to voluntarily accept Elena's
demands and build a cooperative system, or the Holy Church would risk
losing its appeal within the Claydale Kingdom.

Elena and the Holy Church reconciled. The Holy Church had its own
intentions, but the Claydale Kingdom also needed the cooperation of the
Holy Church in order to eliminate the intelligence organizations of
surrounding countries that were trying to create a base in the country
under the guise of reconstruction support.

As a result, Elena gained the backing of the largest religious
organization on the Sars Continent and at the same time succeeded in
suppressing the influence of the Holy Church, solidifying her position
as Crown Princess.

<br />
Offers of support came from neighboring countries: the Condor Kingdom,
the Ills Duchy, the Solhorse Kingdom, and the Gordle Duchy.

The Solhorse Kingdom, which had sent the organization I had previously
destroyed, was trying to create another spy organization in the capital,
but I was asked by Elena to destroy it.

It was a rough solution of pretending that it never happened, but with
the cooperation of the Holy Church, it wasn't difficult, and the kingdom
didn't have the leeway to gather evidence and legally eliminate them.

<br />
"Lady Alicia. I would like you to become a 'Saintess'..."

Hiram, a guest from the Holy Church who had come from the Theocracy,
said such a thing.

He had come here from the main temple to certify Licia as a Saintess,
but with the temple in the capital destroyed and many of the upper
echelons who were charmed by Licia having died, he remained in the
kingdom to manage those on our side.

The temple chief, Nathaniel's grandfather, had survived, but after
awakening from the demon's dream, he regretted being deceived by the
demon and letting his grandson die, so he stepped down from the position
of temple chief.

<br />
"I've told you before that I have no intention of doing so, haven't I?"

Hiram, not intimidated but simply looked at by me, caught his breath for
a moment and lowered his head.

"If possible, please reconsider... You, who have been recognized by the
spirits, are destined to become a 'hero' recognized by the Holy Church."

<br />
The reason why the Holy Church is cooperating even to the point of
accepting all of Elena's demands is not only to protect the position of
the state religion in the kingdom, but also because of me.

That is not a political story but a matter of religious doctrine.

According to the Holy Church's old legends, a Saintess is not originally
just certified, but is one of the "heroes" who fight alongside the
"brave" who appears in times of crisis.

A hero is someone who has been recognized by the spirits, and he thought
that I, who witnessed that battle and defeated the demons, was one.

After the heroine, it's a "hero"...

I sighed softly, took the Solhorse Kingdom dark organization's
documents, and left the Holy Church's temporary facility.

"Lady Alicia!"

Hiram's voice called out as if to stop me, and I turned around slightly.

"I am 'Aria'--just an adventurer."

<br />
   ＊＊＊

<br />
After the battle with Karla, I returned to being an adventurer again.

However, having appeared on the public stage as Alicia Melrose, I was
unable to return to being a free citizen, and my registration is with
the Melrose family.

In other words, I am in the same position as Feld, who is an adventurer
while having a noble title in order to avoid succession disputes.

But I am in a subtle position, more free than Feld while being more
unable to escape noble society than him.

<br />
The reason for that is the "strength" I cultivated in order to escape
the constraints of nobility.

Those who witnessed that battle, and the knights of the Melrose family,
began to call me by the moniker "Iron Rose Princess," and I became a
feared existence that no noble family could touch, and at the same time,
I instilled in the nobles the fear of the possibility of becoming their
greatest enemy if I ever fled abroad.

I wouldn't be troubled. But my grandfather, my grandmother... Elena
would be troubled.

Therefore, instead of attending the academy, I was given time called a
"study period" in order to avoid those entanglements, and I was given
five years of freedom.

Even after those five years are over, I will not return to being a noble
lady, but I will be able to decide on a new job as an adventurer and
something else.

Even now, if Elena asks me to do something, I will act as an adventurer,
like in the case of the Solhorse Kingdom spy organization, but in five
years, I will begin taking over the dark organization as Sera's
successor, and in ten years, I will become the queen's adjutant and
combat handmaiden.

But this is not a fate decided by someone I hate.

It is my will to be with Elena.

That vow is still alive within us.

<br />
"Hey, Aria! Hurry up!"

"Yeah, I'm coming."

Jesha, who had gone ahead, called out to me, and Nero, who was in the
shadows, used a black cat phantom to shake his tail from my shoulder to
tell me that my vision had been looking far away.

Recently, there have been many jobs in the city, and Jesha seems to be
somewhat excited about going on an adventure that feels like an
adventurer for the first time in a while.

This time, it is the extermination of several Wyverns that are said to
be appearing in a monster habitat in the north. Wyverns have the habit
of hoarding treasures, although not as much as Earth Dragons, so she is
probably expecting something.

Elena, who knows Jesha, smiled wryly at Jesha's enthusiasm and gladly
sent her off.

<br />
That Elena has officially become the Crown Princess, and it seems that
applications for betrothal as a royal consort have already come from
other countries. Since it is from the Khalfaan Empire, it is probably
him, whom I know, who has finally made a move.

According to Mikhail, Rockwell also seemed to be in love with Elena, but
he is the heir to the Dandorl family, and it seems to be quite
complicated.

It would be good if Rockwell's younger sister, Clara, could inherit the
family estate, but she acknowledged her sins, and together with Elvan,
who also acknowledged his sins and stepped down from the position of
Crown Prince, it had been decided that she would rule the Dandorl-owned
territory as a viscount.

They will probably not appear on the public stage in their generation,
and they will live a life unrelated to the glamorous world they once
knew.

Some say that decision is lenient, while others say it is strict, but it
seemed to me that they were even relieved to become middle nobles.

Mikhail, who will become Elena's adjutant, began studying under my
grandfather to become the prime minister and head of the dark
organization, and Theo is also working hard every day to become a senior
knight of the dark organization as his assistant.

The last time I met them, they both said, "I'm not giving up yet"...

And--

Karla was officially confirmed dead, and it is said that one of the
court magicians who also participated in that dungeon capture, who was a
distant relative of the Leicester family, inherited the Leicester
family, which had no successor.

There is no tombstone for Karla. That's because she doesn't want one.

<br />
"Okay, let's get going!"

When the carriage reached a position where it was no longer safe to
proceed, we, the new "Rainbow Sword," began to act on Dalton's command.

The reason for the "new" is because Viro, who was the scout, has
officially retired from being an adventurer and has become a knight of
the dark organization. He was still young enough to continue for a while
longer, but I heard that it was because his fiancée, Mary, who used to
be a receptionist, became impatient.

I think it must be very hard to work in the dark organization now, but I
felt that Viro would be able to do it well.

<br />
The heavy warrior, Dalton, the swordsman, Feld, the warrior, Jesha, the
spirit user, Mira, the scout, me...the six of us, including our new companion, a Rank 5 magician, became the new Rainbow Sword.

"Can wyvern scales be sold for as much as earth dragon scales?"

"They're decent as materials. About the difference between gold and
silver."

"Can you eat the meat?"

"That's just lizard meat."

There's not much tension...

While listening to the conversations of my comrades, I look up at the
sky.

The endlessly spreading blue sky.

When I was young, I was weak and always running away--and even after I
gained strength, I kept fighting something.

The days of chasing and being chased, of hurting and being hurt, are
over.

From now on, I am "free." All freedom and inconvenience will be
decided by my will.

<br />
\*Tan\*--

"H-hey."

It seems I was also feeling lighthearted for some reason, too. Feld, with a somewhat
bewildered voice, said to me as I placed my hands on both his shoulders
from behind and climbed on top of him.

"As I thought, Feld's view is wide."

"Is it?"

When I smiled and looked down at him, Feld grinned and started running
with me on his back.

Voices of exasperation could be heard from behind.

At the edge of my vision, a magician girl wearing a white robe hood
shook her wavy white hair and chuckled.

The blue sky that stretches endlessly...

My heart will no longer waver.

<br />
From now on, my "story" will begin.

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this, the main story is complete. Thank you for your long
companionship!

It was supposed to end a little shorter, but before I knew it, it became
such a long process.

The showdown with Karla and the final episode were decided from the
beginning, and the preparation for this included Aria's pendulum and
boot blades, and Feld's gesture of carrying her on his shoulders.

At first, it was an experimental novel to see if this form would be
accepted, to the extent that if there were people with the same hobbies,
but I received more support than I expected, and it even became a book.

Thank you all very much. The fully written Volume 4 will be released in
July, so please check it out as well.

<br />
The main story is over, but Aria's adventure continues. It will be an
after-story like a side story, but instead of the weekly serialization
like before, I will take a short break and then continue it leisurely
with a monthly serialization.

I'm thinking it might be good to write it from the magician girl's point
of view instead of Aria's perspective...

Who is that girl...?

To tell the truth, I've been so busy with multiple book projects that I
haven't had much time for new works!

I have so many ideas, and there are one-shot stories scattered in my
folder (laughs).

<br />
As new work candidates...

1 Heartwarming (psychotic)

2 Pleasure (psychotic)

3 Serious violence (sweet)

These three seem to be suitable for serialization. None of them are
normal lol. The rest are more suitable for short stories.

<br />
Well then, everyone, I'll see you next in this continuation or in a new
work.
