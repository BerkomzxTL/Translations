# 231 Reinforcements Part 1

The runaway actions of Prince Amor, who understood the Saint's
intentions... All that could be gleaned from what the dead Temple Knight
had said was that, and it was unclear what he was trying to do with the
undead.

...This is more troublesome than I thought. That fake "Saint."

Just as I felt when I met her directly, perhaps she should be killed
before she does anything more. But doing so would suppress the confusion
and discord among the people who believe in the Holy Church and the
Saint, and would interfere with Elena, who is trying to secure evidence
and condemn her.

<br />
Similarly, it is difficult to easily hold Prince Amor accountable for
his crimes, but this time he has crossed a line that cannot be forgiven,
rebellion, so it should be possible to create evidence later.

For better or worse, that Prince does not have as much influence as the
Saint. Even so, in order to entrust his subjugation to the Knights, it
is necessary to gather evidence. If I take too much time for that, there
is a possibility that Amor will achieve his goal. ...But.

"That's why I'm here."

Prince Amor will be killed.

It seems reckless to challenge hundreds of undead enemies alone,
something that cannot be entrusted to the shadows or the Knights, but if
Prince Amor is assassinated, the Knights' rampage should be minimized.

<br />
"Gaa..."

"Sorry, Nero. I wasn't alone."

I lightly stroked Nero's nose, which was rubbing against me in
dissatisfaction, climbed onto his back, and first headed for the Second
Knight Order's training grounds, which were said to be near the royal
capital.

"Let's go."

--Yes--

<br />
If I'm dealing with the undead, I could rely on the Rainbow Sword's
companions.

Members of the shadows are always lurking in big cities. If I leave a
message at the Adventurer's Guild in that city, the Rainbow Sword should
be contacted.

Even so, it's questionable whether I can make it in time for Amor's
actions. Unless Prince Amor's attack target is clear, I think it would
be better to have the Rainbow Sword protect Elena's surroundings. I left
a message for the shadows in a town along the way just in case, but in
the current situation, Nero and I have no choice but to act.

...But, what is that Saint thinking? If you think about it normally, if
a Prince from the same faction as her causes problems, it would also
hurt her.

But... maybe, even if it becomes a future "wound," if her only goal is
to "accomplish her purpose," just like Amor...

"We're making a big mistake..."

<br />
A few days later, as I approached the Second Knight Order's training
grounds, I felt a strange sense of unease.

"I don't sense anything...?"

Among the several training grounds, I heard that this one was being used
by those who were applying on behalf of Amor. But if there were as many
as two hundred people, their presence would spread like heat, and traces
of people would remain around them.

Sensitive monsters and animals would no longer approach the area because
they could sense that presence. But around here, I can't feel much of a
human presence, and I can't even sense the presence of large animals
that should be sensitive to it.

<br />
"Gwo..."

"...This is."

When Nero called out, and I turned my attention to it, there were traces
of a large number of people passing by a little while ago. The ground of
the highway, which is compacted and difficult for even ruts to remain,
is one thing, but if a large number of people pass by, those who
couldn't fit on the highway would leave traces of breaking branches and
stepping on grass.

Weeds will naturally recover even if they are trampled on, but judging
from the condition of these broken twigs, it seems that people passed
through here... a few days ago.

Have the Prince and the Second Knight Order already started moving?

<br />
"Nero, do you sense any people around?"

At my voice, Nero stretched out his whip-like antennae extending from
his ears, and the electric light bounced off.

I don't really understand it, but according to that woman's "knowledge,"
he is sending out electric waves over a wide area to detect weak
biological reactions. It only detects biological life, so it can't even
distinguish whether it's a person or not, but if there are creatures
moving in a group in this forest, it's only wolves or people.

If Nero can't sense anything, then there's no one around here. All
that's left is to diligently search for traces of the highway while
tracking...

"Gaaa!!"

"Roger."

Responding to Nero's voice, I ran off in the direction his eyes were
pointing.

If it's a long distance, it's faster to ride on Nero's back, but for
about an hour, my running ability has improved to the point where I can
run alongside Nero without carrying me.

<br />
Nero and I didn't use the highway, but ran through the forest, jumping
from tree to tree, from rock to rock. After running through the forest
for about half an hour—

"Gaaa!"

"I see them!"

<br />
I saw a dozen or so people and baggage carts proceeding along a narrow
highway. It's the Second Knight Order, but not the main force. Probably
baggage soldiers carrying spare equipment and food.

I don't know if they are undead who support Amor, or soldiers who
haven't been told anything. If they're just soldiers, I don't have any
grudges against them, but I'll still take rough measures.

<br />
Zaa!

"Hmph! Who's there!?"

When I left Nero in the forest and appeared from the forest next to the
highway, blocking the road, the baggage soldiers instantly composed
their weapons from a moment of surprise.

"I'm a knight from the shadows. I received a report that undead
creatures have infiltrated the Second Knight Order and I'm
investigating. Even if you don't remember anything, cooperate for the
sake of national security."

"——!?"

At my straightforward questioning without any bargaining, several
knights trembled with tension.

...Amor's followers? Not only that, but behind the five soldiers who
showed tension, there were those who seemed to be "undead" who showed no
reaction to this situation.

On the other hand, if they obediently accept an investigation based on
the words of an unknown little girl like me, or if they ask me back with
righteous arguments like proper soldiers, they are probably people who
really don't know anything, and I would be wasting my time...

<br />
"...Do it!"

At the same time as the soldier who seemed to be the captain muttered
with a determined look on his face, the soldiers behind him, who hadn't
shown any reaction, drew their weapons and jumped out.

"So they really are undead."

I slashed the neck of the soldier who jumped out first with a knife to
confirm that he was undead.

Nero's presence moved in the forest, but I lightly instructed him with
my eyes, "Don't move."

<br />
"So, the Second Knight Order was plotting a rebellion."

Without breaking my expression, I contemptuously called them "traitors,"
and those who still had reason and intelligence, including the captain,
changed their expressions.

"Does a mere knight of the shadows dare to mock our aspirations!"

A young soldier who raised that cry thrust out his spear, and while
dodging the spear and the undead's attack, I slashed the soldier's arm
with a knife. He dropped the spear and retreated, showing off his arm as
it healed with a grin while drawing the sword on his waist.

"You dogs of the greedy margrave! We, who have been given power by
Prince Amor, are justice——"

"Don't take unnecessary attacks!"

"C, Captain, I'm sorry."

The captain admonished the young soldier who was saying something, and
the soldier looked pale as if he had remembered something.

"............"

Margrave...? Why does that name come up here? Is it because I pretended
to be a member of the shadows?

That's also a concern, but why do the undead care about injuries? That
may be related to whether the undead have reason or not.

<br />
During that time, I barely avoided the attacks of the mindless undead
that were attacking, and slashed at them with my knife. But the
doll-like soldiers did not flinch and crossed the line of death, and I
was driven to a large tree trunk by attacks that exceeded the limits of
their strength.

These undead are not yet the same as those Temple Knights, who became
"beasts."

Those who still have reason and intelligence. Those who only listen to
orders like dolls. And those who attack like beasts... If the reason I
stopped them earlier is the reason for the difference between the three,
then I can vaguely see what that means.

"Wait! Surround them so they can't escape!"

At the captain's words, the undead stopped moving and scattered as if to
surround me.

Certainly, that's the surest way to fight with less damage. But in this
state, it should be possible to neutralize me faster by having the
immortal undead attack me as is.

But, the reason why they bother to stop that and "reduce damage" is——

<br />
"If they die too much, they can't be controlled?"

"...You——!"

<br />
It's a guess that I didn't want to be right, but it seems to be correct.

Perhaps they themselves haven't been told, but the undead who have been
parasitized by insects "die" from the wounded areas...

The parasitic insect repairs or regenerates when the host's body is
injured. But there's no such thing as a good deal where you can get an
immortal body without any compensation.

When the injured flesh dies, the insect manipulates the flesh and blood
like necromancy, forcibly connecting them. There is probably a limit to
mana, just like vampires, but they have acquired a regenerative power
similar to that of a vampire.

That's why if they get too injured, they will no longer be living
creatures, and their reason will be lost in stages.

That Temple Knight was able to control them well, but these soldiers
can't control the undead who have become beasts.

<br />
"...What are you going to do with that body? Is that what Prince Amor
did? At least Lady Melrose and Lord Dandorle would never do such a thing,
though?"

"Shut up, you dog of the Prime Minister!"

When I put the questions that I was concerned about into words, the
soldier, who should have been worried about his own body, raised his
voice as expected.

"Your filthy shadow's owner is finished too. No matter how much the
Dandorle family is the Grand Knight Commander, they won't be able to
protect against 200 immortal soldiers without the knights they should be
protecting!"

"............"

Attack the Dandorle family? If that's what those words mean, then it's a
simultaneous attack on the Melrose and Dandorle families.

Two hundred undead are a considerable threat, but not enough to attack
two high-ranking noble families at the same time. So, instead of
directly attacking the castle where the knights are, are they planning
to attack them when they return to their mansions?

Even if the two families' mansions are in the royal capital, they are
not in the middle of the royal capital. Some of the high-ranking nobles
build their mansions outside the walls of the royal capital, and that
also functions as protection for the royal capital.

The problem is that the Dandorle mansion is in the north of the royal
capital, and the Melrose family is in the south.

<br />
"Nero!"

"Gaaaaaa!!"

Responding to my voice, Nero jumped out of the forest, crushed one of
them who had stopped moving, and neutralized him by trampling on his
heart.

In that instant, I also fully activated my body enhancement and tore
apart the heads and hearts of the undead with my knife and dagger.

"I don't have anything else I want to hear."

There is no time. The attack has probably already begun.

<br />
"Wh-what!?"

"A monster!"

"Damn it! Everyone, 'attack'!"

The soldiers with reason panicked and ordered the undead to attack. But
their judgment is slow. If they had zombified to the beast state, they
would have attacked on their own, but the soldiers who prioritized the
command form and feared losing their reason and consciousness even more
were afraid of dying even though they were immortal.

<br />
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"

"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"

<br />
By increasing the purity of my mana and swinging my blade while spinning
around, and Nero's claws swinging while spinning around back-to-back,
tore apart and ripped apart the undead who had been ordered to jump in
like a small tornado.

No matter how immortal they are, if their bodies are cut into pieces,
their movement can be sealed. Even if they don't die from that, I can
stab them later to finish them off.

<br />
"Impossible..."

The captain muttered in astonishment at the sight of the soldiers who
were supposed to be immortal being "destroyed," and in the next moment,
he raised his voice as if glaring at us.

"Anyone! Tell His Highness about this!"

<br />
Perhaps because they had hardened their resolve in the face of genuine
"death," the captain tried to buy time by sacrificing himself in order
to inform the main force of the threat that "we" posed.

Perhaps sensing his resolve, the conscious soldiers attacked Nero and
clung to him like death soldiers.

Seeing the figures of his comrades, the young soldier who had been
enraged at first made a tormented expression, but tried to escape from
the battlefield without hesitation.

But I can't let you guys escape either. I threw a throwing knife at his
back—

"You think I'll let you..."

There, the captain jumped into the line of fire and caught the knife
with his forehead.

They will escape if things continue like this. Just then—

<br />
"Out of my way!!"

A man who appeared to be an adventurer appeared from the other side of
the highway, perhaps having heard the sound of battle, and the young
soldier drew his sword and tried to cut him down.

Kiiin!!

"Gah!?"

But the young soldier was cut in half along with his steel sword by the
greatsword that the adventurer unleashed, and was blown away scattering
blood.

A jet-black greatsword that was taller than my height... The man who
swung that greatsword with ease, who was even bigger than the
greatsword, made a slight smile when he found me.

<br />
"Was my help unnecessary? Aria."

"Feld!"
