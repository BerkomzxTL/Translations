# 278 Bandit Extermination

"I'm going too!"

Just as we were about to head out to subjugate the bandits, Grandma
(Samantha), who appeared out of nowhere, suddenly shouted that.

Honestly, I was really surprised. Wasn't she supposed to be at the inn?
I really don't understand how she can slip past my and Aria's
detection...

I guess it's pointless to worry about it, so putting that aside for now,
I should at least warn her.

"There's nothing interesting there, you know?"

<br />
I doubt there are any bandits worth killing for fun.

When I told her that out of kindness, Grandma furrowed her deeply
wrinkled brow and glared at me.

<br />
"White little girl... What do you think I came all this way for?"

"Honey wine?"

"That's not it!!"

When Aria and I said that in unison, Grandma denied it for some reason,
even though she was the one who brought it up in the first place.

"But..."

"Right?"

"Goodness, you little girls are noisy! I've already drunk the honey
wine!!"

So she did drink it after all.

"Listen well, little girls! The reason I'm accompanying you is because
of your body, white little girl...!!"

"Oh..."

<br />
I had completely forgotten... she's so senile.

Since I was a child, all-attribute magic stones had been pressing on my
heart, so I wasn't supposed to live to adulthood. In order to make
effective use of my short lifespan, I wished for a \[Gift\] from the
spirits of the dungeon, to 'borrow in advance the high-level magic I was
supposed to reach and be able to use by the time I became an adult.'

Because of that, my lifespan was further reduced, and even if I had won
against Aria in that battle, I would have died on top of her corpse.

That was my wish. That was my only hope.

But... Aria crushed my fleeting dream and forced me to live.

For Aria's sake, I decided to use this life for her.

But Aria is greedy and wants me to live even longer.

Really... she's such a mean girl.

<br />
"...So, what are you going to do?"

Honestly, I hadn't taken her seriously. Even if she weren't elderly and
senile, I knew there were limits to what a human mage could do.

Even my wonderful father, who is now living in hell with my brothers,
aimed so high as to further experiment with his research results on his
daughter's body, but eventually gave up on reaching that point in his
own generation.

I was diligent, but not a genius, so I didn't want to live.

But... if it's this "genius"...

<br />
"Leave it to me. I'll fiddle with your bodies and make you the
strongest. Heh heh heh."

...Is this going to be okay?

"Little girl, where's my honey wine!? What did you do with it!?"

"Yes, yes, let's drink it at the inn when we're done."

As if mimicking Grandma's granddaughter, Aria handled Grandma with a
practiced air.

I really wonder if this is going to be okay...

<br />
Most bandits weren't criminals from the start.

Most of them were originally just villagers.

Even in the Claydale Kingdom, with its mild climate and easy living, if
the population grows too large, they seek new land, develop areas
inhabited by monsters, and expand the places where people live.

For that place to become farmland and a farming village that can pay
taxes, they must patiently cultivate it while repelling monsters and
wild animals.

Adults must balance cultivation and farming while repelling external
enemies, and in many villages, the hands of young children were also
needed as workers.

The more children, the more workers. However, even if children grow up,
there isn't enough farmland to match, and the second and third sons of
farmers who gave up on further cultivation often went to work in larger
villages and towns.

However, for those who had only been taught farming and hadn't received
much education, leaving the village alone required "courage."

If they had courage... or at least a strong sense of curiosity, they
should have been able to earn a daily wage as a worker or adventurer in
the town. But those who didn't have the courage to step into a new path
kept running towards the easier option and learned to take from others.

<br />
The bandits who appeared in that viscount's territory were a little
different from the bandits who simply hid and attacked carriages.

Those bandits had "knowledge." They changed their attack points so as
not to be found by guards and soldiers, divided their numbers into
groups of several, appointed a leader for each group, and had those
small groups managed by someone higher up who ensured that orders were
carried out thoroughly.

Bandits who only knew farming villages couldn't do that.

It was done by a "former villager" man.

<br />
The man had ambition and dreams. He wanted to go to the city, become a
successful adventurer, and eventually be called a hero.

He made friends, gathered the bare minimum of equipment with his daily
wages, defeated vermin and goblins that attacked villages and was
thanked for it, felt the world expanding as he learned to read and
write, and then challenged a dungeon... and failed.

<br />
The man could only reach Rank 2. Just a warrior. He wore ill-fitting
secondhand leather armor and wielded only the cheapest club.

One of his companions became Rank 3 and joined other adventurers to
challenge dungeons, another gave up on being an adventurer and studied
reading and arithmetic and was hired by a shop, and another learned
farming knowledge and returned to the village.

The man couldn't go anywhere. He couldn't return to the village after
making such a big show of himself, he had no special talents, and he was
just struggling in poverty.

At that time, one of his former companions, still worried about him,
came to see him. He told him to try again. But the man, seeing the
successful life of his former companion... stole his wallet and ran
away.

<br />
The man became a "thief."

The man who became a thief was behind this bandit incident.

From the beginning, the Thieves Guild had their eyes on the Dandorl
family's new industry, but it was difficult to get involved and gain
benefits because the Dandorl family was keeping a close watch.

However, the man, having heard about this, didn't even consider the
rights and interests that required "knowledge" and "connections," and
only thought about taking directly.

What the former villager man came up with was to use bandits.

The Thieves Guild, which understood that evil deeds were being done and
didn't kill, and the bandits, who feared that their evil deeds would be
discovered and killed, were incompatible. To thieves, bandits were like
mindless animals, and they particularly hated being equated with them.

But the man didn't reject that idea based on his former villager
thinking, and he gathered young men who were lingering in the villages
and tried to profit by "using others," which he had learned in the two
guilds.

<br />
"You guys, today it's the 'Valley'! Hurry up!"

The man gave instructions to the bandits. They had several hideouts
prepared and had been avoiding the eyes of the guards by resting in
places far from the attack sites.

They sold the stolen goods through the Thieves Guild's back channels and
attacked merchants who came to buy based on information they bought from
the guild. As long as the supplies needed to maintain the bandits were
bought in nearby villages and towns under the guise of merchants, the
guards would never reach the man.

The man's experience of being used by those above him as an adventurer
and thief came in handy.

The problem wasn't the lord's guards and soldiers, but the high-ranked
scouts who tracked them in small numbers, but Rank 4 and 5 famous
adventurers wouldn't come out for something like a bandit incident.

But...

The man who ran away from being an adventurer didn't know that there
were famous adventurers who would do something that didn't even bring
"profit."

<br />
"...Huh?"

In the forest, which was dark even during the day... one of the bandits,
who had been moving while erasing their tracks in small squads, suddenly
fell.

Because he fell without making a sound, the members of his squad became
suspicious and approached, when suddenly dust billowed up and a "white
shadow" danced.

"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"

Only then was a scream heard, and in the blink of an eye, several
bandits were splattered with blood.

"What's happening..."

The man couldn't understand the scene before him.

All the man could do was blankly watch his underling bandits die without
being able to do anything, when suddenly a "woman's" voice was heard
from behind him.

<br />
"It's a good day to die, don't you think?"

<br />
When he turned around, a "white girl" was smiling gently at the man with
her hands still covered in blood.
