# 239 Distorted Holy War 6

Dandorl Margrave and Feld, having evaded Amor and the Second Knight
Order's attack, managed to rush into a mansion in the outskirts of the
royal capital.

"Secure the gates! Amor and the rebels will be here soon! Prepare for
battle!"

"Oooooooooh!!"

<br />
Thanks to Rockwell's advance report, the Dandorl knights, though
bewildered, were wary of the enemy. Upon hearing the order of the
General Commander, they immediately discarded any doubts and began to
act as knights.

This high level of training is Dandorl's strength, but also its lack of
flexibility.

What compensated for this was their friendship with the Melrose family,
and Dandorl made up for the lack of forces on the Melrose side, but they
are now divided and under simultaneous attack.

<br />
"That Amor... he may seem crazy, but he's playing a clever game."

Dandorl Margrave gave instructions to his subordinates while biting his
lip.

Even if he seems to have gone mad, Amor knew that the two frontier
families should not be allowed to cooperate even in peacetime.

But that's natural for an educated member of the royal family. Because
he knew the history of the Claydale Kingdom, he regarded Dandorl and
Melrose as dangerous.

<br />
In the first place, the Amor that the margrave knew was by no means
incompetent. It was just that his self-esteem was terribly low because
he was compared to the talented but early-deceased former Prince.

Because of this, he became introverted and somewhat self-deprecating,
but he shouldn't have been that foolish.

Although he has already obtained permission from the royal family to
defeat Amor, Dandorl Margrave intends to defeat Amor even without it.
However, Amor has become an undead, an unknown enemy... and has likely
become something other than human after gaining a "Gift" to achieve
that.

<br />
Currently, Dandorl's forces consist of fifty elite members of the First
Knight Order that the margrave brought from the castle, thirty-odd
Dandorl knights, and knights who were training here.

In terms of numbers, there is not much difference between them and the
army led by Amor. In hand-to-hand combat, Dandorl, with its extensive
battle history, would have the advantage.

However, those who were training were young knights being taught by the
Dandorl family knights, and many would be sacrificed if they fought the
undead. Even if the other knights had three times the number, it was
obvious that they would be at a disadvantage considering that the enemy
was undead.

To break through that--.

(Those people...)

<br />
The mighty man with the black greatsword—Feld Tungs. He hears that he
has left the house and changed his surname, but he is still a member of
the Count Tungs family with noble status.

His exceptional swordsmanship and physical abilities have been famous
since he was young. If it hadn't been for the family feud, he could have
even been appointed commander of the Knights.

(If he didn't have that power, would he still be living as a noble?)

While the margrave thought so, he was grateful that he now had him, one
of the dragon slayers at Rank 5.

<br />
"Sir Feld, I thank you again for coming. We will gather the main people
to discuss how to deal with the rebels, but would you please come as
well?"

"Of course. But Your Excellency..."

"Ah..."

Following Feld's gaze, which slightly frowned, the margrave showed a
similar expression when he saw "her."

<br />
Karla Leicester, the Leicester Count family's daughter, one of the Crown
Prince's fiancées.

Although she is still a girl before adulthood, she is already known as
one of the kingdom's leading magicians, alongside her father, the Rank 5
Head Court Magician.

But reality is sometimes more merciless than rumors. Many people
regarded her as dangerous, but those who investigated her were shocked
by the facts.

She has been increasing her power by continuing to dive into dungeons
alone since she was a child, and participated in the royal family's
dungeon capture as one of the Crown Prince's fiancées and obtained a
"Gift."

As a simple force, Karla is already regarded as the strongest magician
in this country, surpassing her father, and was the kingdom's greatest
force alongside the Dragon Slayer Girl.

However, her mentality was extremely dangerous, and even if that was
known, no one knew how much damage would spread if she was recklessly
questioned and resisted, and those who touched her without realizing it
met a miserable death.

There is no doubt that she is the greatest force in this place as well.
However, if Karla acts freely, the knights on our side will also be
harmed. It was necessary to have a certain amount of discussion before
that.

<br />
"...Oh, what's wrong? General Commander?"

When the margrave and Feld went to Karla's place, Karla, who had been
watching the knights' movements with boredom, glanced at Feld for a
moment and immediately spoke to Dandorl Margrave.

"Miss Leicester, thank you for your help earlier."

Although the Dandorl family's peerage is higher than the Leicester
family, Karla, as the Crown Prince's fiancée, holds the position of
quasi-royal family member and was someone he had to bow his head to.

"It's fine. They're just troublesome opponents for ordinary people,
right? I'm happy to deal with them all, you know?"

There is no ulterior motive in Karla's words. She simply thinks that
ordinary humans are a nuisance.

In response, Dandorl Margrave quietly exhaled after a short pause.

"...No, that won't be necessary."

<br />
In this case, it might be the right answer to throw Karla at the enemy
like a bomb. I don't know how much great magic Karla can use, but if we
don't put the knights in front, the damage should be minimized.

But--

<br />
"We are knights of the kingdom. We have a duty to protect this country,
and that includes you, Miss Leicester."

"Hee..."

Karla's eyes narrowed slightly at Dandorl Margrave's words.

No matter how strong Karla is, Karla is still a girl and one of the
royal family that the Knights must protect. Also...

"Miss Leicester...are you pushing yourself too hard?"

"............"

As the margrave pointed out, Karla's complexion was worse than when she
appeared, looking more like a dead person than a dead person.

Dandorl is also an old noble involved in the core. He knows the price of
"Gifts". Perhaps the reason why she didn't use her "Gift" in the
previous battle was because of such reasons.

Smiling thinly at the margrave's comment, Karla suddenly turned her gaze
to Feld.

"Come to think of it, what happened to that "cat" of yours?"

<br />
Feld, who was refraining from speaking so as not to interrupt the
conversation between the upper nobles, frowned at Karla, who suddenly
spoke to him, but answered dutifully.

"...Are you talking about Nero? He's outside. It seems he has no
intention of associating with humans. Except for Aria. And I intend to
stand on the front lines with him."

Now, there's no need for noble-like language. She's a girl who's the
same age as Aria and has combat abilities equal to or greater than
Aria's, but I felt that there was no need to worry about her more than
Aria.

Even so, I felt that Karla and Aria understood each other even if they
weren't friends. Perhaps because of that, I wasn't overwhelmed by the
"killing intent" that exuded from Karla, and I didn't feel any more fear
than necessary towards her.

<br />
"I see..."

Karla smiled as if raising the corners of her lips at the two, who were
implicitly warning her not to do anything unnecessary, and flipped her
robe and sat down on the stone steps leading to the mansion.

"In that case, I'll leave it to you. I hope it doesn't come to a point
where I have to step in."

"............"

The margrave and Feld bowed and turned their backs to Karla, who was
looking somewhere else as if the conversation was over.

It is impossible to judge what Karla's purpose is in siding with us. It
may just be a whim, or it may be because Aria is involved.

However, Feld had a feeling that Karla had her own intentions, based on
the impression he had heard from Aria and the feeling he had when he
faced her directly. And, Karla's retreat once without pursuing Amor was
solidifying his suspicions into conviction.

<br />
"Enemy forces discovered!"

At that moment, a voice echoed from the watchtower, and Feld and the
margrave looked at each other.

"There was no time to talk... Sir Feld, may I ask for your help?"

"Yes, that's why I came. Me and that guy outside."

"...It's very reassuring."

As for the margrave, he couldn't completely believe that a Rank 5
phantom beast was siding with humans from the bottom of his heart.

The same was true for Nero, who basically didn't trust humans other than
Aria. He had some respect for people involved with Aria, but Aria was
the only one he wanted to be with.

<br />
"Gaaaaaaa!"

Nero, who was outside the castle walls, heightened his fighting spirit
to fulfill his promise with Aria.

Originally, Nero would have been by Aria's side in any situation.
Although that was Aria's wish, the reason why he fought to protect
unknown humans was because he thought his power was not enough.

Nero did not see humans as a threat, considering them fragile creatures.
No matter how much they train, their bodies are creatures that can be
easily torn apart by Nero's claws.

However, Aria fought the Rank 7 dragon after a battle and gained power
that surpassed even Nero.

And that human named Karla also has power that surpasses Nero.

The current Nero cannot stop either of them. He cannot intervene in
their battle. If he wants to be with Aria, he thought that he needed the
power to stop them.

Because he knows the loneliness of the strong better than anyone else...

<br />
The same is true for Feld. Aria, who continued to seek power in order to
fight fate, has become one of the most powerful people on this
continent, and there are very few people who can stop her.

Regardless of how Aria lives after settling things with Karla, who has
equal power, he thought that he must not let her be lonely because of
that power.

For that purpose, Feld gripped the hilt of the greatsword made of dragon
horns, a gift from his companions, so that he could at least master it
freely, even though he still hasn't mastered it.

"Well...shall we go?"

Feld muttered in a small voice and rushed up the castle walls, following
the margrave, and Amor's army had already gathered in front of the
castle walls, pointing their weapons at them.

<br />
"Dandorl! You despicable people of the old blood! Now I, Amor, will bring
down the hammer, and now is the time to regenerate the kingdom with new
blood!"

"Have you even lost your pride as a member of the royal family, Amor! By
the covenant of the old blood you speak of, this Dandorl will eliminate
the enemy who disturbs the royal family!"

<br />
Dandorl Margrave retorted from the top of the castle walls against Amor,
who was giving a war cry.

The covenant that the former Claydale Kingdom peacefully united the two
duchies of Dandorl and Melrose—Because there was a covenant that the two
margrave families would be entrusted with the two important positions of
General Commander and Prime Minister in order to eliminate even the
royal family when the royal family was in turmoil.

Amor raised an eyebrow at the word "eliminate" and glared at the
margrave.

"Men, take Dandorl's head!"

With Amor's voice, the knights of the Second Knight Order began to move,
and Dandorl's knights fired arrows from the castle walls.

However, the Second Knight Order did not stop, even if they were hit by
arrows in the head or chest.

"Uooooooooh!!"

Don!

Several knights carrying huge logs crashed into the front door while
receiving countless arrows, and the battering ram rang out with a roar.

"I won't let you!"

In response, Feld jumped out of the castle walls and pulled out the
greatsword from his back.

"--Ground Slash--!"

<br />
One flash—that alone shattered the huge battering ram and tore apart
several knights who were holding the battering ram.

The undead writhing to regenerate. There, those who could use magic on
the castle walls shot the magic of "Fire Arrow".

"Gah--"

However, an arrow fired from the Second Knight Order pierced the
magician's neck, and the Second Knight Order, which had been holding
back due to the limited number of arrows, began to fire arrows at the
castle walls without any regard for appearance.

<br />
"Gaaaaaaa!"

A jet-black beast that had jumped in there repelled the arrows with its
huge body and whip-like whiskers, and crushed the regenerating knight
with its claws.

"Nero!"

"Gaaa!"

Nero responded to Feld's voice, and from among the knights who were
frightened by the roar, the undead who had lost their will pounced on
Nero, but Feld's greatsword cut that knight in half, armor and all.

"Follow Sir Feld!"

The knights with confident arms who were on the castle walls jumped
down, fortified the front of the castle gate with large shields, and
crushed the knights who were in the process of regenerating with maces
in their hands.

<br />
"Damn you, adventurer and beast!"

Amor, seeing his forces being gradually reduced, jumped out with his
sword.

Kinn!

"Amor!"

"Feld!"

The two swords collided, creating crimson sparks and sounds.

Amor and Feld became classmates at the academy and knew each other even
though they had never spoken directly. But that's not all in a good way.

"You will know my power as well!"

"What!"

<br />
Feld was loved by everyone for his blessed physique and outstanding
swordsmanship. He had to quit the academy halfway because of his power,
and Amor pitied him, but he hated the look of pity that such a man gave
him, a prince.

The fact that he was thought to be more pathetic than himself, the
unfortunate Feld, left a small scar on Amor's heart.

Amor sought "the power to not lose" from the dungeon spirit.

It is the "power of the hero in the story" who gets up no matter how
many times he falls and finally wins.

However, the dungeon spirit saw that the source of that desire was the
humility that had been hurt since he was a child due to being compared.

<br />
The dungeon spirit loves people. Like giving children as much candy as
they want, the spirit responded to their wishes with compassion.

A boy named Nathaniel sought the power to bring down God's iron hammer
in order to protect the girl he loved... in order to drive away the
pink-haired girl who killed people as if looking down on God.

However, when the spirit realized that it was impossible even if he paid
any price, he summoned a "demon," the optimal condition he sought
instead of the "Gift," and introduced him to him with (..)goodwill (..).

And for Amor, in an attempt to give him the elements of the heroes of
this world, he had the summoned demon give him a parasitic worm from the
demon world that turns people into the dead, and recreated him with a
spirit that does not feel any anxiety due to the compassion-based
"Gift".

<br />
A strong "Gift" destroys the body.

Nathaniel should have sought holy magic to protect someone.

Amor should have wished only for the mental strength to overcome his
humility.

Knowing that strong wishes destroy the body, that girl—Licia did not
tell them that, but instead incited them and had them take the "Gift"
they desired.

<br />
"I was reborn! I'm different from you, who ran away!"

"Kuh."

Feld parries the sword swung with inhuman strength.

Feld is better at swordsmanship. Feld's greatsword repeatedly cuts
Amor's body, but he has to dodge the parasitic worms mixed with the
scattered flesh and blood each time, and Amor, who regenerates in the
meantime, gradually began to overwhelm Feld.

"Gaaa!"

But Feld is not alone.

Nero, who had defeated the surrounding undead, hammered his claws into
Amor, seeing an opening.

"Guo... beast!"

Amor rolled to the side, Nero attracting his attention. And Feld has no
reason to overlook that.

"--Slash--!"

"Guooooooo!?"

Finally, Feld's battle skill caught Amor, tearing off his upper body as
if gouging out his heart from under his armpits.
