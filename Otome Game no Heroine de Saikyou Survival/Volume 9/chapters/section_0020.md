# 280 New Kindling

"Please wait!"

As we were discussing our next destination after finishing our business,
we saw a staff member from the adventurer's guild we had visited only
once hurrying towards us.

"... Whew. I'm glad you're still here."

"What's wrong?"

When Aria asked, the stout male staff member wiped away his sweat and
took out what looked like a document.

"Um... you are Aria-san and Snow-san, right? We have received a message
from Dalton-sama of the "Rainbow Sword"."

<br />
Dalton had sent messages from the royal capital's adventurer's guild to
the guilds in the regions where Samantha was likely to visit all at
once.

Just putting up posters in the guilds would cost a considerable amount
of money, but to go to the trouble of contacting us, I wonder how much
money it cost?

The guild staff went to the trouble of finding us probably because we
were a conspicuous party of a young woman and an old woman, and because
Aria was famous.

A scout of rank 5 party. "Cinders" who is feared even by thieves and
assassins.

Her reputation, which had previously only been known in the underworld,
is gradually spreading overseas.

<br />
"So, what is it?"

"... Return to the royal capital immediately. That's all."

When I asked, Aria, who was reading the message, answered.

"Here."

"... Concise."

That's all that's written. Conversely, it shows that it's a very
important matter.

Moreover, if he sends it to so many guilds, clever people will know that
the "Rainbow Sword," which is also connected to the nobility, is trying
to do something.

But Dalton prioritized time over being known to opposing factions.

"Let's go back... Are you okay?"

"It can't be helped."

<br />
If Aria is really in a hurry, she'll go straight through the forest
without using the road or carriages.

My health isn't completely back to normal yet, but I've learned a few
things from Grandma, so let's proceed while putting them into practice.

We stored the preserved food we bought at the viscount's territory in
\[Shadow Storage\] and headed straight southeast towards the royal
capital.

... In the end, I couldn't even sleep in bed for a single day.

<br />
We used body enhancement and ran through the deep forest.

"Living in a hurry"... I really think that's a phrase for us.

Aria risked her life for what she had to do, what she had to do, and for
her oath.

I couldn't stop until my remaining life was exhausted, because of
hatred, to kill everything and be killed.

People who don't know anything, people who only know kindness, will pity
us and feel sorry for us.

People who have lived without seeing anything or people who have lived
in a narrow world will call us monsters and fear us, even though we can
kill even demons in our early teens.

When other children were being read picture books by their parents until
they fell asleep in bed, we continued to fight while vomiting blood.

And we don't regret it or look back on it.

Because we decided everything ourselves.

The only people who can complain to someone are the truly blessed.

Do you know?

Most of the dissatisfaction in this world disappears with "death" or
"killing."

That's why we had to become "strong."

And we are still "living in a hurry."

<br />
"You look pale."

"... I don't need medicine."

When I saw Aria looking at my complexion and trying to take something
out of \[Shadow Storage\], I reflexively stopped her.

Because death isn't that scary, but Aria's medicine is bitter.

"That's right. It's about time for new medicine..."

"That's not it."

Why are you digging the ground with new medicine? What's in the forest
floor? Are roasted earthworms really effective?

As I was stopping Aria, who was smiling and looking at me curiously, the
kitty on her shoulder sighed and dispelled the illusion.

"Nero?"

"Gaa."

The next moment, the kitty's "true form," which was as big as a small
house, appeared from Aria's shadow, who called its name.

"What's wrong?"

The kitty, who stroked Aria's cheek with the tactile sense of its ears
as Aria stroked its nose, narrowed its eyes at me as if it was a
nuisance.

"It says it'll give you a ride on its back."

"... Oh, really."

I really don't know how she understands what it's saying.

<br />
After being given a ride on the kitty's back, we arrived in the vicinity
of the royal capital in just a few days, a journey that would normally
take Aria's legs more than a week.

According to the plan, we were supposed to stop in a town along the way
for a day or two, but I missed sleeping in bed again.

Along the way, the kitty returned to Aria's shadow again, and when we
arrived at Dalton's mansion in the royal capital without any problems,
we found Dalton getting into a carriage.

<br />
"You guys were fast. Just in time. You guys come too."

"Me too?"

The carriage isn't the "Rainbow Sword's" carriage as an adventurer, but
a carriage that a discreet merchant would use, so surely the person who
called him was that person?

"That's right, you too, Snow. Aria too, but I was told to bring you
along if you were here."

"... Hmmm."

Unexpectedly intrepid, the Princess. Even though Iâ€™m supposed to be
dead, to summon the person who destroyed the royal capital, does she
have a desire for self-destruction?

She's really living in a hurry. Aria got into the carriage as if she
didn't care... but I guess I won't be sleeping in bed again.

<br />
But, as expected of the Princess. Whether it was planned from the
beginning, or whether she believed that Aria would come, we were waiting
for the Princess not in the royal castle, but in a noble's mansion
nearby.

"Welcome, Dalton, Aria. This is a former noble faction's mansion that
has been seized and is under my care, so you don't have to worry about
other people's eyes. You too."

"... I'm grateful."

As I sat down on the edge of the sofa I was offered without taking off
my hood, the Kruz person and the black-haired maid in the room glared at
me warily.

It seems that there are hardly any ordinary knights in this mansion, but
the maids and servants are also dark knights, and they are all quite
skilled.

Of course, they are the most wary of me. But, because the Princess
allows it, they cannot object. How hard it must be.

<br />
"... Your power may be needed."

The Princess sighed lightly at me, who smiled thinly, and the wary
maids, and began to speak quietly.

"First of all, Aria. Regarding this matter, I intend to use all my power
to protect you. I will leave the final decision to you, but please don't
forget that."

"Understood."

When Aria nodded, the Princess took a breath and showed a serious
expression.

<br />
"To get to the point. The "Hero" who appeared from another continent is
making a formal request from the Holy Church to welcome Aria, who
possesses heroic-level power, as a member of his party."
