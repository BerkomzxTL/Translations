# 234 Distorted Holy War 1

"......Mikhail. Why the long face?"

"It's nothing, Grandfather."

On the way from the royal castle to Melrose's mansion in the outskirts
of the royal capital, Border Count Belt Melrose, the prime minister,
quietly sighed at the somewhat lackluster appearance of his legitimate
grandson, Mikhail, who was riding with him.

<br />
Belt had an idea why Mikhail was acting strangely.

The adopted daughter of Baron Leighton, a princess's guard, and a rank 5
adventurer, had suddenly disappeared. The princess, who was on good
terms with her, subtly spread the "death theory," which confused those
who knew her, but after the factions opposing the First Princess and
their sources of funding began to be crushed, Belt understood the
background.

He had used the shadows to subtly contact her and support her from the
shadows, allowing him to grasp her movements, but Belt secretly lamented
that he wished she had consulted him first, causing his heart to stop.
Oz, the attendant, another passenger, addressed the two of them.

"Would you like me to prepare a drink?"

"No, not right now."

Belt, slightly cheered by Oz's consideration, considered the cause of
this incident again.

It was probably because of that "Saintess." Belt, being a doting
grandfather, no longer thought of her as a granddaughter, but because he
had once protected her, he did not expel her due to the eyes of other
families and branch families.

However, by the time he realized that that girl was "poison," she had
already left Melrose's control, built a faction that included the crown
prince, the younger prince, and even the Holy Church, and had risen to a
level of influence where even assassination was not easily possible.

Belt thought that even if he tried to annul the adoption now, the noble
faction would adopt her as a daughter due to her influence, so he
decided to keep her as an "adopted daughter of a viscount family" as a
final restraint.

<br />
As a result of falling behind politically, he had left her unchecked,
and that girl—Aria—had tried to weaken that power by once separating
from the political constraint of being a princess.

However, Mikhail, who thought of himself as a "companion" as a close
aide to the princess, was lamenting not being informed of anything by
her—no, not that, but at himself for not being able to understand and
act on her intentions as quickly as the princess. From Belt's point of
view, it was childish sentimentality, but he could understand the
feeling.

<br />
There was no certainty. He himself would not admit it. But Belt was
convinced that that Aria was the keepsake of his deceased youngest
daughter, "Alicia."

He wanted her to return to him as his granddaughter. But if she refused,
he wanted her to live freely at least.

If she rejected the nobility, he would just watch over her. He just
wanted her to be alive. But he wanted her to call him grandfather. He
always had the desire to introduce her to Belt's wife.

<br />
He was similar to Mikhail. That's why he had Mikhail return to the
mansion this time to take his mind off things.

It took half a day to return to the mansion on the outskirts of the
royal capital, so Belt only returned about twice a week. Mikhail had
shown his face at the mansion to some extent since entering the academy,
but after becoming a close aide to the princess, he only returned about
once a month.

Mikhail's parents were governing the Melrose territory in place of Belt,
so they were not in the royal capital, but Belt's wife was lonely
because Mikhail did not return, so taking Mikhail back would be a good
diversion for both of them.

If possible, he wanted to introduce Aria to his wife, but Belt
understood that if he forced the issue, that girl would disappear
somewhere.

<br />
"Sir, Lord Mikhail."

Suddenly, Oz's voice, as if urging caution, made Belt look up, and in
response, Mikhail turned his gaze to the outside of the carriage.

"...Grandfather. Doesn't something seem strange?"

"What's wrong?"

Belt stopped Oz from saying anything with his hand, and instead asked
his grandson, who had grimaced, what he felt. Mikhail hesitated
slightly, but began to speak about what he felt.

"After becoming involved with Aria and the shadow knights, I have
finally come to sense things."

"...I see."

Belt was also made aware of the state of the "outside" from the
appearance of the two of them.

There was a unique "atmosphere" in battlefields and places where they
would become so. The signs of insects and animals. The expressions and
voices of people. The traces of paths someone had taken... These
accumulated things became an "atmosphere" that only those who could
understand it could sense.

Mikhail must have been trained considerably under the princess.
Conversely, Belt, who had fewer opportunities to go to the "scene," was
slower to notice the unique atmosphere than the two passengers.

<br />
"Someone—"

"—Sir, horses from the front!"

Before Belt could take any action, the carriage stopped, and the
coachman informed him of it.

"Horses? What's going on!"

If the coachman had noticed, the knights of the Melrose family who were
accompanying him should already be responding, but Belt, feeling a bad
premonition and not hearing any sounds of battle for an attack, glanced
at Mikhail and grabbed his sword.

"Sir, I'll go take a look."

"No, we'll go out too. Mikhail, let's go."

"Yes!"

At Mikhail's response, who had also grabbed a dagger, Belt was inwardly
impressed that he had been trained in terms of courage and grit.

If preparing for an attack, it was better for nobles not to get out of
the carriage. Especially if Oz, a shadow knight, was there, it would be
more prudent to leave it to him.

However, there were no women or children to protect in this place, and
Belt and Mikhail, who had some skill in arms, thought that it was
tactically feasible to get out before being surrounded. Especially
thinking that the people of the Melrose family tended to be active, Oz
quietly sighed.

<br />
"What's going on!"

"...Sir!"

When Belt called out, a man who had been talking to the knight at the
head noticed Belt and raised a shouting voice.

"Nils? What happened?"

He knew him. He was one of the attendants at the mansion, not a shadow
knight, but he remembered him as a relatively calm person. What was the
reason he was so flustered? Why had he come to such a place far from the
mansion?

When Belt asked him what had happened, Nils dismounted and approached
Belt with staggering steps, raising his voice with a desperate look.

"Sir, it's terrible! People who appear to be knights are heading towards
the mansion! A knight who went to challenge them was killed on the
spot!"

"What!"

Belt took a step towards Nils to hear the details—at that moment, he
drew his sword from his waist.

"S, sir!?"

Clang...!

"...It seems we were led into a trap."

<br />
Belt, who had slashed away an arrow that had flown from somewhere, had
Oz and the knights take up arms and be on guard around him.

There were multiple routes from the royal capital to the Melrose
family's mansion, and only Belt himself or an attendant like Oz knew
which road to choose that day. That's why Nils, who had tried to report
the crisis, had been led by the "enemy."

<br />
When three more cavalrymen appeared from the dark night road, the man at
the head with a bow in his hand bowed while still mounted.

"I presume you are Prime Minister Melrose."

"...You, Kirkland?"

"Indeed. I am Kirkland, captain of the Second Knight Order. It has been
a long time since we spoke face to face like this."

"What... what is the meaning of this?"

<br />
He was the one who had fired the arrow earlier. He was the second son of
the Viscount Kirkland family, a handsome man of about thirty, and Belt
remembered being introduced to him at social gatherings as a young but
capable knight.

Belt had also received reports from the shadows that Prince Amor had
taken over the Second Knight Order and was gathering weapons in some
parts of it.

After consulting with Grand Knight Commander Dandorl Border Count, the
matter was settled by dispatching the royal capital's guard and the
Knight Order and the shadows to monitor, but that was only two days ago
and no subsequent report had yet been received.

<br />
Even if they gathered soldiers, the things that could be done with just
a few hundred people were trivial. At least if they were going to do
something, they would need several times that number of soldiers to
encounter the Third Knight Order guarding the royal capital and, even if
they won, their exhaustion would make proper military operations
difficult.

Besides, Amor was a prince, even if only nominally. He was currently
infatuated with a strange woman, but even so, he thought,
\*common-sensically\*, that he would not act rashly as a member of the
royal family.

Was he going to attack somewhere? What would happen then? Even if he
accomplished something, the only thing that would remain afterwards
would be the infamy of national treason and the dishonorable result of
"death" by subjugation.

Amor was not such a foolish person. Belt, who had known Amor since he
was a young prince, thought so.

At least if he was going to start something, he should have been able to
sense the signs. But—

<br />
"It is, of course, Prime Minister. It is to kill you and the Grand
Knight Commander, and to make the rightful Crown Prince the king."

"What...?"

Belt's eyes widened involuntarily at Kirkland's statement. It was often
the case that those who tried to push their opinions through from the
start were not normal, but this was beyond the pale.

Was he this foolish? Was he this short-sighted?

"Didn't you encounter the Third Knight Order?"

"No, of course we encountered them. It was a small patrol squad, but we
crushed a few of them. If it had been us before, there would have been
casualties on our side as well, but now we have Prince Amor's 'divine
protection'."

"..."

Prince Amor's divine protection... If heard plainly, it might seem like
the honor of fighting under Amor's command, but there were rumors that
Amor actually had a \[Gift\].

<br />
"Do you think you can win with just three people?"

The four knights guarding Belt were all rank 3, and Oz, a shadow knight,
was also a rank 3 expert. Although he was retired from the front lines,
Belt himself was also rank 3, and Mikhail was also about rank 2 at his
age.

Kirkland's ability was said to be close to rank 4, but not quite, with a
combat power of close to 600. The knights of the Second Knight Order
with him seemed to be about the upper rank 2, but with just three
people, they could not defeat Belt and his party.

<br />
"Heh... As expected of the Melrose family. You have good knights. But!"

Kirkland laughed fearlessly in the face of Belt and his party, who
outnumbered them. The ambitious but intelligent face from before was
gone from his face, and a certain madness could be felt.

"We have been chosen by the Saintess, the messenger of 'God'! We have
been given the power to guide this country correctly, and we have become
invincible beings! Now, you guys, show them that power!"

<br />
"......Aaaaaaahhhhh!"

The knights who had been standing silently at Kirkland's voice shouted
and rode out their horses.

"Protect Lord Belt!!"

Oz shouted back, and in response, the four knights rode out their horses
and thrust out their spears.

The speed of a mounted charge using spears became its power. However, if
there was a difference in skill, it was possible to return that charge
to the opponent as a counterattack.

"—!"

The Melrose knight holding the spear stretched out his arm as if to
thrust it back, hitting the knight of the Second Knight Order with the
tip of the spear first. It was a reckless technique that could break his
arm if he only used the strength of his arm, but even so, the Melrose
knight prioritized neutralizing the enemy.

But—

"Aaaaaaahhhhh!!"

The knight of the Second Knight Order continued to advance despite being
pierced in the shoulder, and even with one arm torn off, he slammed the
spear in his hand into the Melrose knight.

"Gah!"

The Melrose knight spat out blood and fell from his horse. Another
knight had also ended up in a suicidal exchange, but Kirkland frowned
slightly at the sight.

<br />
"Oh dear. They no longer have any will, but... if they die too much,
they start to smell like beasts, so try not to kill them too much,
okay?"

"You...!"

Kirkland was already in battle, and Oz and one knight were engaged with
him, but neither was able to make an effective attack.

But what did he mean by "don't kill them too much"? Kirkland's actions
made that clear.

"...'Rise'!"

At Kirkland's command, the two knights of the Second Knight Order who
had been knocked down stood up. Moreover, one of the knights picked up
his severed arm and connected it by pressing it against the wound.

Immortal knights.... Feeling a chill at the sight, Belt thought that it
was Amor's \[Gift\].

He realized that was why Amor had acted recklessly, and why Kirkland had
such mad confidence.

<br />
"That's right. With this power, ordinary people are nothing! We are
God's warriors!"

"...But if they die too much, won't they lose their will?"

Those were the words that Kirkland had also been leaking. If they were
immortal knights, they would be overconfident, but if they lost their
will, wouldn't that be terrifying?

Belt tried to shake Kirkland's spirit with cunning words, thinking about
whether there was any way to break the deadlock. Still...

"Hahaha, His Highness said that he would restore their hearts when the
matter was over. And His Highness never lost his mind no matter how many
times he died! Unlike weak soldiers, I am a chosen warrior like His
Highness, so I shouldn't lose my mind from dying a few times!"

<br />
Kirkland's mind was already in a state where he could not hear any other
words due to the feeling of elation of being "immortal" and "chosen."

It was probably not just the influence of Amor. There was someone who
twisted his heart with sweet words.

<br />
"Now, the chatter is over! It's time for me to have you as my opponent,
Prime Minister!"

Kirkland shouted and jumped out, and his subordinate knights jumped out
in response. The other knight held those knights in check, and Mikhail
had no choice but to deal with them in a disorganized manner.

"Grandfather!"

"Don't let your guard down, Mikhail!"

Belt scolded his grandson and stepped forward. One knight had already
fallen to Kirkland's sword, and Oz's sword was stuck in Kirkland's neck,
but Kirkland flicked Oz away without regard and swung that sword at
Belt.

"This is the end! Relic of the cunning predecessor! Perish along with
that evil soul!"

<br />
"—You will—"

<br />
That "voice" suddenly echoed from the darkness of the night.

Like moonlight spilling from the night sky, a girl with hair dyed the
color of burning ash-iron struck the knife in her hand into Kirkland's
head, and while covering her body with particles of light like silver
wings, she slashed his body in half.
