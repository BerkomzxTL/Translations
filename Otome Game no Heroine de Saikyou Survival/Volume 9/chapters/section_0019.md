# 279 Secret to Longevity?

"Y-You're...!?"

The thief was confused by the "white girl" who suddenly appeared before
him.

Did this woman kill his subordinates, the bandits? What is the meaning
of this act?

The girl had pure white hair, but she looked young, barely an adult. The
clothes she wore were of high quality, and at first glance, she looked
like a young lady from a good family.

There was no way such a slender girl could kill someone.

However, the red blood splattered on her white hair and skin as if to
defile them, and her slender, white hands were covered in blood,
betraying the man's thoughts.

More than that...

<br />
The girl, covered in blood and smiling as if it were an everyday
occurrence, made it clear that she was fundamentally different from
them.

<br />
\*Hyuu\*—

"Hii!"

Perhaps frightened, the man flinched at a faint presence, and the moment
he did, something passed by the very edge of his face, and he felt
something wet on his cheek.

"...I missed."

The man realized from the girl's words and the blood that clung to his
cheek without him even being touched, that it was her attack, and he
rolled away to gain distance.

"Y-You guys! Enemy! Kill her!!"

<br />
Having finally recognized her as an "enemy," the bandit started making a
commotion, and the bandits, who hadn't been able to understand the
situation because their comrades had died so suddenly, finally realized
that this white girl was the one who had killed them, and they began to
move with expressions of anger.

Without knowing who that girl "was."

Without knowing what consequences their actions would bring...

<br />
"Then, shall we begin?"

Among them, only the white girl was smiling as if admiring a flower.

<br />
\*\*\*

<br />
I missed with the dagger, probably because I'm not used to it yet.

I was going to at least let them die in one hit since they're going
along with my whims... It seems like things don't go well even when I
try to be kind on rare occasions.

Well, whatever...

They don't even understand how their comrades died because I killed them
so easily, and they've gotten motivated, so I'll gratefully make use of
them.

<br />
"Woman, yaaaaa!"

One of the men jumped at me without even taking up a weapon. What an
indecent face...

They really don't understand.

"—Kahyu"

Slightly stepping back, I gently sliced his throat with a dagger, and
the man passed by me, collapsing headfirst onto  the forest floor.

<br />
"Hey, what are you doing!"

"I'll do it!"

The men were complaining about their fallen comrade without even
understanding. While gently dodging the men who were attacking me one
after another with thought acceleration from body enhancement, I slit
their throats, broke their necks, and reaped their lives at a speed
invisible to their eyes.

"W-What's going on?!"

When the men finally understood that they were the ones being hunted, I
smiled at them.

"It's okay"

<br />
The means of prolonging life that Samantha taught me. To put it simply,
the secret to long life that she is still practicing is, in a way,
simple.

That is to train body enhancement, which ordinary magicians do not do.

I can also use body enhancement because it's necessary for thought
acceleration. That's why I practiced martial arts, which I'm not good
at, against monsters.

But my 《Martial Arts Skill》 is only at level 3 at best. Even so, I can
speed up my thoughts by 30%, and that's enough as an auxiliary to magic.

But Grandma was different. She was able to use thought acceleration one
level higher than level 4 martial arts.

What made that possible was mana control.

It's a necessary technique for using magic efficiently, suppressing
consumption, and increasing its effect, but it seems like she uses it to
control body enhancement and strengthen not only the muscles of her
limbs but also her internal organs.

<br />
"W-What is this woman?!"

"D-Don't come near me!"

I chased, overtook, circled around, and killed the fleeing bandits at
twice their speed.

It's not like I'm only killing them with body enhancement. With my
current abilities, there's a limit to how much I can enhance myself even
with mana control.

But Grandma knew a technique to train it efficiently.

That is, to use life magic.

Life magic that uses weak magic that doesn't generate a mana stone in
the heart. By handling it precisely, it becomes a training in
controlling body enhancement, and it itself becomes a fine "weapon."

"Gyaaaaaahhhhh!"

"H-Help..."

I increased my defense by wrapping wind around me like gloves, creating
sharp claws of earth from the dust in the atmosphere, and microscopic
water made my figure hazy with a mist of light and darkness.

But I don't use "fire."

Because it's a promise with Aria...

<br />
To the lucky man who dodged my last attack and is trembling, I will give
him kind words at the end of his life. It's okay... rest assured.

<br />
"Dying isn't that scary."

<br />
\*\*\*

<br />
We subjugated the bandits, and we received some reward from the
adventurer's guild.

Even if a rank 5 party wiped them out, the reward wouldn't be issued
immediately unless the guild or soldiers confirmed it, but it seems that
the lord, upon hearing Aria's name, immediately agreed.

In the town square, the lord and his young wife publicly declared that
the bandit disturbance had been resolved, and the residents cheered.

Hmph...

As I thought, you guys seem happier in that kind of position...

<br />
"Well then, I'm going home!!"

"...Huh?"

I couldn't help but ask again at Samantha's sudden statement after she
had finished drinking her fill of honey wine.

"What about training? Aren't you going to teach me?"

I couldn't help but be reminded of the good-natured dark elf, Cerejura,
and when I asked, she looked at me with a puzzled expression.

"White girl!! You should learn through practice! What I'm using is just
my own style! You should refine it from now on and make it your own
technique!! Well then, farewell!! I want to play with my
great-grandchild soon!!"

Saying that in a voice as loud as if she were on the other side of the
street, Grandma raised a cloud of dust and disappeared in the blink of
an eye before I could stop her.

I couldn't help but furrow my brow and look at Aria, but she didn't seem
to care as she began to pack her luggage.

"You were satisfied because you could drink honey wine, right?"

"You do as you please... Not that we're in a position to say that."

The kitty on Aria's shoulder yawned in exasperation at me, who couldn't
help but sigh.
