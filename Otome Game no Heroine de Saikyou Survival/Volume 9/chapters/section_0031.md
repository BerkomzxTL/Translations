# 259 Graduation Event "Finale"

"Aria..."

In the ruined hall of the royal castle, Elena muttered her name.

The fire in the royal capital, fortunately or unfortunately, did not
spread beyond a certain point due to the destruction of buildings by the
intense battle, or being instantly burnt to ashes. But more than that,
the six pillars of fire rising from the edge of the royal capital began
to coalesce in the sky above the capital, emitting an ominous amount of
mana and stirring up the people's fear.

The massive pillars of fire set up by Karla... No matter what their
meaning, unprecedented damage was expected.

Normally, Elena, being royalty, should have evacuated. However, Elena,
along with her father the King, the Prime Minister Count Melrose, Elvan,
and Clara, did not evacuate, but watched the battle of the girls in the
distance.

<br />
The castle scribes and knights. Nobles and commoners who had failed to
escape stopped and watched the battle of the two at the peak, as if
mesmerized.

And Elena clasped her hands to her chest, thinking of the girl she
believed in, who was about to settle things for the sake of her
convictions.

<br />
"Win, Aria... You are the 'strongest.'"

<br />
\*\*\*

<br />
"――――tsu!!"

The "Golden Dagger" I swung down broke through Karla's defenses, and
fresh blood gushed from her alabaster chest.

Bakiin...ッ!

At that moment, the golden blade thrust into her heart shattered with a
clear sound, and the orichalcum dagger given to me by the spirits turned
to dust, including the guard and hilt, and disappeared.

<br />
Don!

A huge amount of mana was released from Karla's entire body, blowing me
away, who was above her.

Zusaa...

"...What did you do? Aria?"

Karla, who was holding her face as if dizzy while blood dripped from her
chest, glared at me through her fingers as I took distance, scraping the
ground with my heels in the ruined noble district.

"I told you."

I showed her a small glass bottle containing a bright red liquid that I
had taken out from \[Shadow Storage\].

"I'm going to kill you... "

<br />
At the same time as those words, I threw the bottle at Karla.

The moment her gaze followed its swaying trajectory, I jumped out and
kicked it as if to crush it with the bottle. Karla leaped down to evade
the liquid leaking from the broken bottle, more than my kick, and
slightly frowned at the scent of the scattered liquid.

<br />
"...It seems I've been poisoned with a troublesome poison."

"............"

Half right. The wound from the dagger thrust into her heart is not as
deep as the blood flowing from it would suggest. That's why Karla judged
her physical condition was due to the poison smeared on the dagger.

Karla's entire body was covered in wounds that were beyond healing, and
she was barely clinging to life with the light magic enveloping her
body.

My beloved weapon had cracks in it from the fierce battle, several of my
bones were cracked, and my left arm was already unable to move properly.
I spat out the blood overflowing in my mouth, as if I had taken damage
to my internal organs, and Karla smiled faintly with her bloodied lips.

Ah, that's right...

Daan!!

We leaped out almost simultaneously and kicked each other, blowing each
other away.

Even if only a sliver of life remained, Karla would not stop.

Even if there were a thousand knights in this place, she could not be
killed.

"I'm the only one who can kill you."

"That's right... Come. I'll exchange it for your life."

Karla's defense was already beginning to crumble. The black thorns
covering Karla's body were also beginning to wither and scatter, with
black rose-like petals scattering.

<br />
Doon!!

Karla didn't have the leeway to use magic or martial arts, and switched
to a tactic of turning her life-draining mana into shockwaves. I was no
longer able to maintain Reality Breaker, and countered with Iron Rose
body enhancement and the martial arts I had honed in previous battles.

I heard the sound of a rib cracking from the shockwaves released by
Karla. Without flinching, I moved forward and struck Karla's forehead
with a headbutt.

"――tsu!!"

At the same time, blood spilled and flowed from our foreheads as they
bounced off each other. Karla dyed one eye red, and wore a gentle smile.

"Too bad... Time's up."

<br />
"tsu!"

A burst of shockwaves was released from Karla's entire body. Karla
blasted me away, even taking damage herself, and using that momentum,
rose once again into the night sky. Behind her... A giant pillar of fire
was about to become one in the night sky.

<br />
"The match is mine. So you'll die with me..., Aria."

<br />
Smiling happily... and just a little sadly, Karla raised both hands to
the heavens.

Rank 8 fire magic - it was not the way she wanted to end things, but her
goal would still be achieved.

Karla looked around the royal capital where flames were still smoldering
one last time, and brought down the mana she had put into both hands.

<br />
"――\[God's Wrath (Megiddo)\]――"

<br />
With Karla's activation words, a huge amount of mana swirled like a
dragon in the sky above the royal capital, and then――

<br />
"――Eh."

The huge amount of mana scattered in the night sky, dissipating into
mist.

Even the few remaining clouds disappeared from the impact of the mana's
disappearance, and Karla, who was staring up at it in amazement amidst
the starry sky, quietly turned her face to me.

"...Aria!!"

Karla and I glared at each other from the sky and the ground.

"I'm going to kill you. But..."

Daan!!

At that moment, using the remaining \[Levitate\], I instantly soared
into the sky and kicked Karla's chin.

"I won't let you have it your way."

<br />
The misfire of God's Wrath (Megiddo) - no matter how amazing a magician
Karla was, fire magic could not be activated without the fire attribute.

That was the "price" Karla had sought from the spirits.

<br />
"Kuh!"

Black thorns shot out from Karla, and while my shoulders and arms were
slashed by the thorns, I dodged them by spinning around and slammed my
right elbow into Karla.

Karla caught it with an arm wrapped in thorns, and then, using the
thorns, threw me backwards while spinning, and fired mana as a shockwave
at that spot.

"――!"

I was momentarily dazed by the force of the impact. But even so, I
grabbed Karla's thorns, and with that momentum, flew towards the castle,
dragging Karla along.

<br />
"Aria!!"

I heard Elena's voice. I glanced for a moment at the destroyed hall, and
saw not only her but also many other figures. But in that instant, Karla
regained her stance and slammed me into the floor of the hall as if
kicking me away.

"It's not over yet!!"

Baan!!

A sound like the air bursting was heard, and Karla, having released a
shockwave on her own back, was covered in blood, but she still kicked
out with her mithril heels, which were no longer anything but weapons,
at the fallen me with all her might.

Gakin!!

"tsu!"

I took it head-on. Karla's heels were deflected by the "reverse scale" I
had placed in my chest, and I grabbed the dress of Karla, who had
greatly lost her balance, with my right hand and slammed Karla to the
floor over my shoulder.

<br />
"Ariaaa!!"

"Karlaaa!!"

<br />
The voices calling each other echoed across the battlefield.

Quickly stamping my heels, I jumped over Karla, who was trying to get
up, as if riding on top of her, and pinned both of her hands to the
floor with the blades on my heels.

"Kuh!"

Karla's face contorted and she let out a groan. I wrapped the pendulum
thread I had taken out from \[Shadow Storage\] around Karla's neck, bit
the end of the thread with my teeth, and pulled the thread with my
remaining right hand, and Karla's eyes widened.

"――tsu!!"

The thread dug into Karla's slender neck. Both of her hands were sealed
by my legs, and even if she could move her legs, kicking in this
position would not inflict any damage.

Shockwaves of mana released by Karla struck my body from all directions.
I endured it while using my teeth and right hand, and pulled the thread
with all my strength.

<br />
No one in this place reached out to help.

Not even gods or spirits, I would not let anyone interfere!

Killing intent and intimidation burst forth from us as if rejecting
everything, and the moment the shockwaves stopped, Karla closed her eyes
and smiled as if falling asleep.

"--Aria--"

I thought I heard Karla's lips... mutter that.

<br />
We met six years ago--.

Since then, Karla had hoped to die by my hand.

And finally... Her wish came true.

<br />
Gishii...ッ!

The sound of bones creaking echoed in the silent hall. I released the
thread from my mouth, and while collapsing as if all strength had left
me, I gently touched Karla's cheek with my trembling hand.

<br />
\[Karla Leicester\] \[Race: Human Female\] \[Rank 5\]

\[Mana Value: --/--\] \[Stamina Value: --/--\]

<br />
"Karla..."

Karla, completely pale, was dead, smiling.

In the atmosphere where no one could make a sound or move, I put my
still moving right hand around Karla's waist and picked her up.

I quietly started walking, and stopped in front of a certain person.

<br />
"The request is complete."

"Alicia..."

My grandfather... Count Melrose, gasped at my words.

I'm sorry to my grandfather and grandmother, but... For her death, I had
no intention of living my life as a princess of Melrose.

And Elena, whose gaze met mine for a moment, nodded quietly as if she
understood everything.

<br />
"Wait, where are you going!"

"Aria!"

As I walked towards the broken window with Karla in my arms, His Majesty
the King's voice echoed, and not only that, but I also heard the voices
of Mikhail and Theo, who had rushed over. I stopped at the window and
gently turned back to them.

<br />
"If you have a request, I will always rush to your aid."

<br />
I jumped out of the window with Karla in my arms, and amidst the roar
released by Nero, who had caught us on his back, we disappeared into the
darkness of the night.

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The showdown with Karla.

In the end, I aimed for a dirty showdown to the death, not a flashy
special move, friendship, or victory.

What lies in Aria's heart as she carries Karla away...
