# 253 Graduation Event "Father and Daughter"

"Karla... What do you intend to do!!"

Count Leicester, with the moonlit night sky as a backdrop to the
daughter floating in the air, was aghast.

Receiving the hateful voice of her father yelling at his daughter, Karla
wore a cheerful smile as if enraptured by the chirping of a bird.

Karla had burned to death the magicians of the sorcerer brigade who were
trying to oppose the demons and launch an attack. Even if father and
daughter were at odds, the attack on his subordinates was a clear act of
treason against the country. Putting aside what he had done, he was
indignant that someone with the name of the Leicester family had done
it.

However, in response to the father's attitude of criticizing her as if
it were natural, Karla looked down at her father from the sky as if
mocking him.

"Oh my, am I getting caught in the crossfire? I thought you wanted to
\`play' with me."

"You...!"

Ignas, Count Leicester, could not suppress his gnashing of teeth at
Karla's flippancy, who had managed to survive amidst that barrage.

<br />
Even the magicians who had just had their comrades killed held their
breath, unable to move, in the strange atmosphere that was different
from the battlefield.

The murderous intent emitted from the girl floating in the sky, who was
smiling calmly, combined with her deathly pale skin, resembled the "grim
reaper" from the picture books she had read as a child.

"..."

In the midst of this, Ignas, hiding one hand behind his back as if to
conceal it, gave instructions to some of the court magicians under his
command.

Several men, having received these instructions, began to move silently,
and one of them...a black-haired youth, wearing a distorted smile while
trembling, was in a position outside of Karla's field of vision.

(...Karla.)

The youth had no intention of allowing Karla to exist. More than being a
court magician under the Leicester family's control, he had a reason to
kill Karla.

<br />
The Leicester family had three sons. But they followed their father's
idea of using his daughter for experiments, and were killed by their
sister in retaliation. If they had lived, they would now be court
magicians like the youth, walking the path to glory.

Magicians do not simply compete in attacking power or flashiness.
Intellect, scheming, and even negotiation are forces of a magician, and
the goal of a magician is to know the depths of knowledge.

Court magicians are those who believe in the power of comprehensive
wisdom. In particular, noble magicians often sought this intellectual
power. It was unforgivable for a monster who sought only violent power
to kill the next generation of court magicians.

But more than that, he could not forgive the existence of his "sister,"
who had instilled fear in him.

<br />
No matter what outrages Karla, who had become the royal family's
betrothed, committed, they, as court magicians, could not directly lay
hands on her as she was related to the royal family. All they could do
was assassinate her through assassin guilds or poisoning, but Karla
survived all of those attempts.

But now it's different. The Crown Prince had fallen from grace, and
Karla had lost the protection of the royal family.

This is a battlefield. It would be difficult to hold anyone accountable
for who dies at whose hands. Especially in Karla's case, there is no one
to protect her.

If Karla, who was holding back the demons, were to die here, the damage
might increase, but for the youth, killing Karla was more important than
the damage caused by the demons.

<br />
In order to make Karla's death look like an accident, the court
magicians under the Leicester family's command, with the black-haired
youth at the center, took aim at Karla floating in the sky. The youth
hid behind ordinary magicians so as to not stand out, and released mana
at Karla.

"--Fire Javelin--"

At the same time as he fired, more than a dozen attack spells were
released at Karla from the surroundings...but.

<br />
"——!?"

All of the attack spells passed through Karla, and the \[Illusion\]
floating in the sky wavered and disappeared.

"Oh my, you were here after all."

"What!?"

The black-haired youth tried to jump back with a pale face at Karla, who
had suddenly appeared behind him, but Karla's hand grabbed the youth's
arm faster than he could react.

"...Uwaaah, gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"

Flames overflowing from the inside of the white hand burned the youth's
arm. Karla, gazing affectionately at the screaming youth, shook the
charred arm she had torn off, showing it to her father.

"Look, older brother, you have a matching set with your beloved father."

<br />
The black-haired youth was Karla's second oldest brother, the only one
to survive.

Nine years ago, the youth, who had his brothers killed, feared his
abnormal sister and was unable to approach the house, becoming mentally
ill, and had been constantly waiting for an opportunity for revenge ever
since.

His burned arm was the same part of the body that his father, Ignas, had
burned to a crisp by Karla a few months ago, and Ignas, holding down his
left arm that had not yet regenerated, widened his eyes in anger at the
wickedness of his daughter, who was shaking that arm like a toy and
grinning with an innocent face.

"Kill Karlaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"

<br />
The court magicians, feeling terror at Ignas, who was now screaming to
kill his daughter without caring about appearances, began chanting
spells.

It wasn't as if they didn't know Karla's strength. But at the same time,
they were well aware of her vulnerability. If they landed even one hit,
Karla would die. That's why they chose to attack without hesitation,
while understanding the threat.

Karla is strong. But that is the strength of a mercenary who only knows
how to fight, unlike the wise magicians they revered. Deep down, they
looked down on Karla and despised her.

But--Karla's strength, honed to kill many people single-handedly, was
beyond their comprehension.

<br />
"--Gah."

Before they could even scream, they were pierced by \[Lightning\] along
with the magician they had used as a shield, and several people behind
him collapsed as their internal organs were burned.

"Shoot, fire!"

One of the court magicians, hearing that, raised his voice in dismay and
fired \[Spinning Blades\], which was intercepted by a magician caught by
Karla's \[Ice Whip\] becoming an ice statue shield, and the electricity
fired from behind it stopped the hearts of the magicians in a wide area.

<br />
"Let's use electricity here too!"

"That will hurt the others!"

A magician who still had reason left hesitated at the words of a court
magician who was in confusion. Area of effect spells cannot be used on
Karla who is constantly moving to places where people are.

"Damn you!"

That court magician, who spat it out not out of hatred but out of pure
rage, pulled out a dagger and attacked Karla, who appeared nearby.

However, Karla is not just a magician. Karla, who had learned martial
arts and body strengthening to continue fighting alone, and had obtained
thought acceleration through advanced mana control, lightly dodged the
attack and burned the head of the man she had grabbed with an iron grip.

<br />
"Increase the number of attacks! If it hits, you'll die!"

The magicians who were being killed one after another gave up on
high-power spells based on anger, and switched to level 1 spells.

Even the common magicians, who were close to the nobility and could not
escape due to their position, joined in, and small-scale attack spells
rained down on Karla like rain.

"--Hurricane--"

However, all of them were repelled by the tornado swirling around Karla,
and those unlucky ones who were caught up in it were swept up into the
sky, and even the attack spells that managed to get through were blocked
by the hem of Karla's silvery dress, without leaving a single scorch
mark on the silvery fabric.

<br />
"Fufu."

Karla danced alone in the blood and death of the people, thinking that
she didn't need bad partners before dancing with the main one.

With one hand, she pinched the hem of her dress to fend off fire arrows,
and lightning struck as if to shake off an offered hand of invitation.

<br />
"Get out of the way! Fireball—!"

"Your Excellency!?"

Ignas fired a \[Fireball\], causing the magicians who saw it to scream.

He called out. But in terms of timing, those around Karla did not have
time to escape.

Ignas is a rank 5 fire magician, and has absolute confidence in his fire
magic. At this distance and timing, he was confident that he could even
kill a rank 5 monster.

The reason why he deliberately spoke aloud in a position where Karla
could hear him was to block Karla's escape route by having the magicians
who were trying to escape act as a wall.

Karla, with a faint smile on her face at the inhumanity of using not
only her own child but even her subordinates as tools, grabbed a
crouching something that had escaped the tornado's damage while jumping
down, and threw it with all her might using body strengthening and
\[Weight\].

"Here you go~♪"

<br />
"――――!?"

Karla's brother, who had been thrown, let out a scream that couldn't be
heard, collided with the approaching fireball in mid-air, scattering
explosions and flames like fireworks.

Doooooooon!

As those who had not escaped the scattering flames and heat suffered and
screamed, Karla, protected by a wind barrier, smoothed her disheveled
black hair with her fingers from the heat, and smiled at Ignas, whose
skin was burned by the heat of his own fire.

<br />
"Oh my, it seems like you have lost your successor. It's another
do-over, isn't it, Father?"

"Don't screw with me!!"

Ignas shouted back at Karla's playful words.

With all of his sons dead and even his own brothers eliminated by
scheming, only he and Karla remained in the Leicester family's main
bloodline.

He had no intention of handing over even a single fragment of the
prestigious Leicester Count family and magic materials to branch
families. But Ignas was filled with fear and anger at the sense of
reality that his life and the Leicester family would be lost by the hand
of his daughter, whom he had used and discarded in experiments.

"Don't screw with me, don't screw with me, don't screw with meeeeee!
There's no way that this me and the Leicester family can be crushed by
an experimental animal like you!!"

Karla, as if mocking Ignas who was shouting in frenzy, held her hands
filled with mana like wings towards the sky.

<br />
"--Fireball--"

<br />
Father and daughter simultaneously fired fireballs at each other.

Karla has more mana, and Ignas has more skill. The two fireballs
collide, but this time they do not explode, and all of the power
suppressed by each other's mana swirled in the middle of the two.

"Uooooooo!"

Ignas poured mana into it as if filled with hatred. Whether it was the
difference in experience or the result of his persistence, the power
slightly began to lean towards Karla's side, and at the moment when
Ignas smiled slightly with a sweat-soaked face--

"--Fireball--"

Karla released a second fireball with the mana she had accumulated in
her left hand, and the two powers and doubled mana directed all the
flames towards Ignas.

<br />
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

Ignas' scream echoed in the night. Perhaps he was wearing Mithril armor
like Karla, Ignas was still alive in the flames.

But only his torso and head were protected, and he couldn't even stand
up, writhing in pain.

Thud...

"As expected of Father. I'm glad you're alive."

Karla, who had approached with the sound of stepping on burned gravel,
spoke in a cheerful voice to her dying father.

"...Stop it, please stop. I'm doing this for the Leicester family..."

"I've heard that many times since I was a child, so that's enough."

Karla interrupted Ignas' words and gently placed the heel of her Mithril
high heel on Ignas' head.

"Stopppp..."

Just as Karla was about to put strength into her leg--

<br />
"Please wait, Karla-ojousama!"

"...What is it?"

When Karla slightly turned her gaze around, the magician man who had
tried to admonish Ignas first and was attacked by his subordinates was
approaching, leaning on the shoulder of someone who seemed to be a
companion.

"That person... Count Leicester, I've heard rumors that he has done
terrible things to you. But, after the battle with the demons, a person
like the Count should be necessary!"

<br />
The operation of the country cannot be done with only pure people. If
the royal capital is damaged, there is no guarantee that there will be
no countries that will interfere, seeing that the national power of the
Claydale Kingdom has declined.

The royal family and the prime minister will somehow manage political
matters, but there may be situations where the intelligence and the
scheming ability of the court magician order are needed for problems
such as spies and sabotage.

Calling Karla "Ojou-sama", he must be a Leicester family retainer or a
member of a branch family. His words seemed to be worrying not only
about the Leicester family but also about the kingdom itself.

To him, Karla turned not only her gaze but also a gentle face and
smiled.

"Fufu. What an interesting joke."

<br />
Squish...

<br />
Having finished the matter as if crushing an insect without letting out
a scream, Karla shook off the blood that had splattered on her hem as if
brushing off raindrops, and while passing by the man standing there with
a pale face, she spoke to him just a little.

"Why don't you do it instead of leaving it to others?"

Passing by the man who couldn't say anything, Karla used \[Cleanse\] to
remove the dirt, and jumped back into her "stage" again.

<br />
"Goodbye, Father. If we can meet in hell, let's play again."
