# 273 Long Time No See, Royal Capital

"You are..."

The giant mountain dwarf in front of me looked at me with a look of
dread and almost rose from the sofa. ...Well, I can imagine how he
feels. Being the leader of an adventurer party must be tough.

<br />
Aria, the Kitty, and I cleared a large-scale dungeon.

I thought I'd get a complaint from that spirit after defeating the
Chimera, but unlike humans, it didn't seem interested in things that had
already happened. Aria and the Kitty didn't have any particular wishes,
and we were able to exit the dungeon safely.

But was it really "safe"...? Aria couldn't move for about two days at
the inn, and the Kitty didn't come out from Aria's shadow.

Even those two were like that, so I ended up bedridden for five days or
more. ...I had to drink Aria's special medicine again.

My mana stone should be getting smaller now that I've gone from six
attributes to four, but I have a feeling it'll be a bit larger than a
normal four-attribute stone.

It can't be helped since I synthesized the attributes. But it should
still be smaller than a five-attribute stone, so let's be happy that I
can spend a little more time with Aria.

<br />
"No good? Dalton."

When Aria asked the mountain dwarf... "Rainbow Sword" Dalton that, he
sat back down on the sofa and glared at her with a difficult expression.

That's understandable. It looks like trouble, no matter how you look at
it.

<br />
After our... mainly my, condition recovered enough for me to move, we
first headed to Dalton's mansion, the leader of "Rainbow Sword" in the
royal capital.

The other members weren't there, but Dalton was home, and Aria
introduced me to Dalton as a 'high-ranked magician the party was looking
for.'

Dalton was surprised, but I was surprised too... I didn't think she was
serious.

<br />
"Aria... I understand what you want to say. But..."

Saying that, Dalton turned his eyes from glaring at Aria to looking at
me. My hair color has changed, and the dark circles under my eyes are
much lighter, but it seems like people who know me will still be
suspicious. He and I didn't have that much contact, but perhaps he feels
a connection precisely because he doesn't know my face?

After the battle in the royal capital, Aria disappeared with my corpse,
and then a few months later, she brought back a high-ranked magician. If
you're perceptive, you'd notice.

<br />
"If Viro quits, the fighting power will be unbalanced. If I move to the
rearguard, won't there be a shortage of magicians with just Mira?"

"Certainly, we were looking for a magician... and a rank 6 one at that?
And you cleared a large-scale dungeon with just the two of you? What are
you two thinking?"

"Not just the two of us. Nero makes three."

"...What is that lineup..."

Dalton, making the large sofa creak as he looked up at the sky, seemed
more stunned than troubled.

<br />
"I also think it's a bad idea."

"Snow?"

Aria and Dalton turned their gazes to the words I uttered.

Aria probably thought about various things and came to that conclusion,
but she doesn't explain enough. I'm the same, but that's been our
weakness, having been active individually for so long.

"The royal capital hasn't been restored yet. If I, the culprit, am
alive, it will cause trouble for your comrades."

It's not like me to mourn the dead now, and I don't have a shred of
regret for killing the enemies. That's why it's impossible for me, an
evildoer, to join Aria's party.

"I'm an 'evil person', so there's a 'way of life' that suits me."

I'm grateful for having my life saved, but I don't want to be by Aria's
side if it means causing her trouble.

But --

<br />
"Don't run away."

Aria looked at me intently without changing her expression.

"Take responsibility for what you've done. Your life of revenge is over.
You can live as you like after that. But before that, settle things.
This party can make use of your power."

Aria says to not become like Cerejura, who could only live by killing in
the underworld, and to come out into the surface world. She stood up
from the sofa, stood in front of me, and peered into my eyes as if
crouching down.

"Don't be afraid. If you go astray, I'll kill you again."

"...Yes. I don't mind being killed by you."

The same promise as before. But the difference is that I want to die for
your sake.

<br />
"Haa\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~... I understand."

Dalton, who had been listening to our exchange, let out a long breath
and turned his face with a frown.

"Snow... is that okay?"

"Yes, that's fine."

"Honestly, it's hard for me to trust you. But if Aria says that much,
then I'll brace myself too. It's certainly better to keep you where I
can keep an eye on you."

"It's okay. I won't betray Aria."

When I smiled, Dalton's expression turned sour instead.

"Aria!! Keep a close eye on her! And have Gelf make a set of equipment
for her! Convince the other guys... no, search for them and bring them
here!"

"Understood."

"For the time being, we'll keep the fact that Snow is a rank 6 magician
a secret. As well as the attributes. Snow will be registered as a rank 5
magician with four attributes: light, darkness, water, and wind. Got
it?"

"That's fine."

<br />
Dalton is quite the hard worker, isn't he? It seems like he's used to
having only strange members so far.

It seems like everyone will go to the party registration together. Are
they going to intimidate everyone by going together to gloss over
things?

<br />
"I'm a noble, so I can't leave the royal capital while it's still being
restored. But we still get requests. Until now, we've been sending
whoever was free, but this time, you guys will take it and leave the
royal capital."

"It's true that it's better for me not to be in the royal capital right
now."

When I answered that, Dalton sighed again.

"...Why are our magicians always problem children? While you're on the
request, have Samantha teach you how to move as a party."

Ah, I've heard of her. A retired magician from Rainbow Sword, the Desert
Witch, was it?

<br />
"Got it. Then, can I leave Snow here?"

Aria, nodding at Dalton's words, stood up again and said that.

"Oh, are you going somewhere? Aria."

"I'm going to see Elena. It shouldn't go too badly if I explain things."

<br />
Ah, it's true that it would be better to talk to her.

But... isn't she angry?

<br />
\*\*\*

<br />
When Aria arrived at the royal castle not through the main gate but
through the gate for those concerned, the gatekeeper, who had already
been told by the princess and the prime minister to let her through with
the highest priority, hurriedly went to call someone who knew her face
and had her taken to the princess.

<br />
"Aria... do you have something to say?"

"Sorry..."

Aria sincerely apologized to Elena, whose smile was slightly thinner
than the last time she saw her.

Even though Snow had been resurrected, Elena and Count Melrose, the
prime minister, had apparently struggled quite a bit because the person
involved was gone. More than that, they must have been quite worried.

"Go and be scolded honestly by Count Melrose as well."

"I will."

Elena softened her anger somewhat at Aria's childlike honesty, looked
around, and clapped her hands lightly.

"Clear the room."

<br />
Aria had been guarding the princess for over three years, so there were
no particular problems, and only the close aides who knew the situation,
such as the maid Chloe and the butler Josef, were left.

Then, starting with Elena's complaints and scolding Aria here and there,
she told her everything that had happened up to this point.

Elena had become the crown princess. Elvan's fianc√©e was now only Clara,
and the two had become the lords of a viscount family in the Dandorl
region. Mikhail and Rockwell had officially become close aides.

And when it came to Aria's story...

"...Things have become quite the mess, haven't they?"

Elena pressed her forehead as if she had a headache, and decided to keep
it in her heart as a matter that couldn't be made public, or rather,
wouldn't be questioned.

"As Dalton said, it would be better for you to leave the royal capital
for a while. Bodyguards aren't needed for a while, but I'd be happy if
you could take on requests from the dark side."

"Understood."

<br />
After that, the two chatted about trivial things for a while, and as it
was almost the time when Aria's grandfather, the prime minister, was
likely to come flying in, Elena suddenly remembered something and
continued.

<br />
"Aria, I've heard rumors through the dark side that a ship of 'heroes'
from another continent has arrived at the Meirune National Union in the
northern part of the continent."
