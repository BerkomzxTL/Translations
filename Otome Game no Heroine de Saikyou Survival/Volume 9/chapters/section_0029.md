# 257 Graduation Event "Clash"

"Aria..."

<br />
Feld gripped the hilt of his greatsword, spotting Aria and Karla about
to clash amidst the flames of the temple.

<br />
Giant pillars of fire rose to encircle the royal capital... If that
black-haired girl was involved in such an abnormal sight, an
unprecedented catastrophe could occur.

<br />
(Should I intervene?)

<br />
Aria was entrusted with the battles against Karla and the demons. This
was not only because Aria was the only one capable of countering them
with combat power, but also because she was the only one with the
ability to evacuate in the event of a supernatural destructive
phenomenon.

<br />
Aria and Karla... The two girls were fighting to the death to settle
their feelings.

<br />
But, was it okay to just watch in such an emergency? Currently, the
riots had subsided with the defeat of the demons, and thanks to the
soldiers of the castle, the evacuation of this area was complete.

<br />
If he intervened now, the damage could be minimized. Just as Feld was
about to take a step,

<br />
--Stop--

<br />
A will from behind reached Feld, stopping him.

<br />
"... Nero."

<br />
"Gaa."

<br />
Nero narrowed his eyes as if looking at something dazzling, and quietly
watched Aria and the others. Nero, now newly evolved, could probably
intervene in their battle. But Feld exhaled and relaxed his grip on his
weapon, seeing that Nero did not approve of it and was watching over the
girls.

<br />
--Withdraw--

<br />
"Understood. You're right, I should back off."

<br />
Nero intended to remain in this place. However, if Feld remained, there
was a possibility that Aria would not be able to fight with all her
strength. Feld clenched his fist tightly at that realization, but looked
back for just a moment.

<br />
"Win, Aria..."

<br />
\*\*\*

<br />
My pink hair changed to a burnt iron-like ash gray, and the particles of
light and darkness scattering from it became "silver," spreading like
wings.

<br />
Black thorns emerged on Karla's sickly white skin, writhing and wrapping
around her entire body, and from those thorns, enormous mana erupted
like flames.

<br />
"--【Chase Lightning】--"

<br />
Multiple lightning bolts were released from Karla's fingertips, changing
angles in the air and attacking all at once.

<br />
"--【Reality Breaker】--"

<br />
In that instant, the silver particles became my phantoms, leaving
afterimages, and as the lightning bolts pierced the many afterimages in
front (..), I kicked Karla from directly above (..).

<br />
"--【Iron Skin】--"

<br />
Gann!!

<br />
Karla raised her fist, and an impact and striking sound that was like
kicking iron resounded. But now, would the hardness of iron deter me!

<br />
With a momentary time difference, I swung down the other kick. The
rushing force and the added weight from illusion magic caused cracks to
run through the remaining temple, starting from Karla, and the temple
collapsed as if crushing Karla.

<br />
"Haaaaaaaa!!"

<br />
I wrapped the light of Reality Breaker around a dagger, and fired the
silver particles towards Karla, buried in the temple below.

<br />
The swirling light gouged out the flames and rubble as if engulfing
them, and just as it was about to pierce through the temple, countless
black thorns pierced through the rubble as if engulfing it even further,
and a voice that seemed to resonate from the depths of the earth could
be heard.

<br />
"--【Blizzard】--"

<br />
GoooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

<br />
A huge blizzard that froze even the flames - a level 7 ice magic that
blew away everything in the almost ruined temple, foundation and all,
and Karla stared intently at me, who was dancing in the air using the
scattered rubble as a shield, from the center of the crater.

<br />
"--【Darkness】--"

<br />
Amidst the blizzard that raged as if shaving off the silver particles,
I, using Reality Breaker, teleported behind Karla and struck an elbow
into the back of her head.

<br />
But that figure of Karla disappeared into the "Darkness" as if blurring,
and Karla's kick, with black thorns wrapped around her leg, was launched
from directly behind me.

<br />
In that instant, I closed my eyes, and relying only on the sensations I
felt on my skin, I twisted my body to dodge while entangling my leg with
Karla's leg as if colliding with it.

<br />
"--!"

<br />
For the first time, a sign of Karla catching her breath was conveyed.
Slashes would not cause damage. Just as I put strength into breaking her
leg as is, Karla unleashed magic that would engulf even herself.

<br />
"--【Dig Volt】--"

<br />
Baginn!!

<br />
"--!"

<br />
The released electric shock collided with my particles of light, and I
and Karla, who were violently sparking and repelled as if blown away,
faced off again in the frozen temple ruins that had become a vacant lot.

<br />
""............""

<br />
We stared at each other in silence.

<br />
As Karla's entire body became enveloped in light aether, the burns she
had sustained from her own lightning strike disappeared in an instant,
and as I re-wore the shaved off light particles, I took out a dragon
blood pill from my pouch, which suppressed mana consumption, and
crunched it in my mouth.

<br />
"...【Bless】...【Regene】..."

<br />
Karla, seeing this, increased her defense and regeneration, and let out
a faint smile.

<br />
The reconnaissance is about to end. Having finished our warm-up and
confirming that neither of us had any room to hold back, we quietly
raised our mana and took a forward leaning stance.

<br />
【Aria (Alicia)】【Race: Human Female】【Rank 5】

【Mana Value: 287/400】【HP Value: 243/300】10 Up

【Total Combat Power: 2484 (During Special Body Enhancement: 4560 +
500)】36 Up

【Total Combat Power: 1885 (Special Combat Power: 5405)】58 Up

【Gift: Soul Thorn Exchange/Life Time】

<br />
Dan!!

<br />
I was the first to move. I stepped out as if crushing the frozen ground,
and closed the distance of dozens of meters in an instant, dragging
particles of light like a comet.

<br />
"--【Hurricane】--"

<br />
In response, Karla unleashed a hurricane from point-blank range, and I
flew through the air as if dancing in the wind, dragging afterimages,
and swung a knife at Karla's neck from the side (..).

<br />
But Karla was wrapped in the wind she had unleashed and danced in the
air, and unleashed the mana accumulated in her arm as if swinging it
down.

<br />
"--【Storm】--"

<br />
A wide-range wind different from a hurricane attacked all of my
afterimages.

<br />
For Reality Breaker, where everything is both real and an illusion, a
range attack with no escape was the right answer. Moreover, a storm has
not only wind but also rain.

<br />
"--【Ice Storm】--"

<br />
Karla's Ice Storm froze the water droplets and turned them into blades
of ice.

<br />
At that instant, I spun as if dancing, batting away the approaching
microscopic ice with the hem of my black dress, and slammed a
pendulum-shaped weight released by one of the afterimages from directly
above Karla.

<br />
"--【Cataract】--"

<br />
At that instant, a level 5 water magic erupted a huge amount of water
centering on Karla.

<br />
The amount of water killed the power of the pendulum, and Karla, who
easily flicked it off with her bare hand, unleashed even more mana.

<br />
"--【Flare】--"

<br />
Level 6 fire magic - the released pure white fireball struck the ground,
and at that instant, an enormous amount of heat instantly turned the
surrounding water into steam.

<br />
"--!"

<br />
I teleported into the sky while protecting myself with my black dress to
evade the water vapor, but I lost sight of Karla for a moment in the
mana-containing water vapor that spread over too wide a range.

<br />
"I'm here."

<br />
At that voice that I heard from directly behind me, I twisted my body
and unleashed a kick. But Karla's figure was not there, and beyond the
noise of shattered darkness, Karla's figure floating multiple fireballs
in the air towards me from a distance was reflected in my eyes.

<br />
"--【Fireball】--"

<br />
Several fireballs attacked me all at once. I instantly released a knife
fired from the slit of my skirt, and burst through the flames that
exploded on touching the blade in the blink of an eye, and kicked out
the blade of my heel with that momentum.

<br />
"--【Cataract】--"

<br />
Again, water that erupted as if gushing protected Karla.

<br />
"Ha!"

<br />
I exhaled with spirit, wrapped particles of light around the leg that
unleashed the kick, and the swirling silver light pierced through the
water's defense.

<br />
Gann!!

<br />
Karla, who guarded with black thorns, was blown away, making a hard
sound.

<br />
I immediately chased after her. But the moment I saw the lump of
darkness that was left behind like a parting gift, I turned my face
away, and a spear of ice released from the darkness flew past as if
grazing me.

<br />
"--【Typhoon】--"

<br />
A violent wind blew from Karla, who regained her stance in that instant.
I dodged it with the Reality Breaker's teleportation, and kicked down on
Karla as if stomping on her from directly above.

<br />
"--【Cataract】--"

<br />
For the third time, the gushing water sapped the power of the kick, and
in the meantime, Karla space-teleported as if disappearing into the
darkness.

<br />
"............"

<br />
Something's wrong. Why is she using water? Karla used fire too, but if
she uses them alternately, the fire and water aether should cancel each
other out and the power should decrease. In the first place, in order to
dodge the pendulum and kicks, there is no need to overuse level 5 water
magic, even though she has infinite mana.

<br />
I felt a sense of incongruity in the fact that she was frequently using
attributes that Karla had not used much before because their destructive
power was reduced, and at the same time, I noticed that the surrounding
scenery was darkening.

<br />
"Karla!"

<br />
I looked up at the sky and glared at Karla floating in the cloudy sky
(..) that hid the moon.

<br />
Using the ability to see in the dark and using the flames burning in the
royal capital as a blindfold, she used water and fire to raise water
vapor into the sky, and summoned it with the wind attribute.

<br />
All of that was a prelude to using magic over an impossible range, just
like the pillar of fire.

<br />
At the same time that Karla's mana increased, light flickered in the
dark clouds that spread to cover this area -

<br />
"Accept it... Aria."

<br />
Karla, looking down at me, gently extended both hands as if giving a
bouquet of flowers.

<br />
"--【Thunderstorm】--"

<br />
In that instant, countless lightning bolts rained down as if burning
down everything in this area.

<br />
The Reality Breaker's teleportation jumps to the place seen with the
eyes. The still remaining water vapor hindered my field of vision, and
the level 7 lightning that used the rain clouds had crushed my escape
routes over a wide area.

<br />
But...

<br />
"Okay... I'll accept it."

<br />
I spread the silver light of Reality Breaker like a giant wing, and shot
a pillar of silver towards Karla as if engulfing everything.

<br />
The thoughts of the two collide in a "killing each other."
