## 294 Antagonism

"―Wyverns!"  
It was one of the Temple Knights on watch who noticed them.  
The "Rainbow Blade" and the Temple Knights led by Vincent had been
deemed non-combatants by Hero Klein and ordered to stand by at the rear.
While the Temple Knights, acting on the Holy Church's orders, had no
choice but to obey, Dalton and the "Rainbow Blade", knowing the threat
of an Elemental Dragon, understood Alia's intentions and decided to
comply to avoid unnecessary deaths among the Temple Knights.  
Of course, as high-ranking adventurers with ties to the Claydale Royal
Family, this also served to avoid antagonism with the Holy Church. But
the main reason was their trust in Alia and Snow, Claydale Kingdom's
greatest combat forces.  
Nevertheless, as adults, they still wanted to protect girls who had just
come of age from politics. If a problem arose, they had decided to
intervene in the battle with the Fire Dragon, even if it meant opposing
the Holy Church.  
Just then, the roar of a "Dragon" starting a battle echoed from afar.
Everyone's attention was drawn to it for a moment, and in that instant,
wyverns burst forth from all around.  
  
"Whoaahhh!"  
How many wyverns had been hiding in these rocky mountains? One wyvern,
rapidly approaching, attacked the Temple Knight on watch. The Temple
Knight screamed but instinctively raised his shield. But at that moment,
an arrow flashed past above his head.  
***"Gugaaaaaaah!?"***  
The arrow struck the Wyvern's eye without fail, and the attacked Wyvern
hurriedly flew away into the sky.  
  
"Dalton!"  
Miranda, who was the first to notice it and fired the arrow, called out.
Dalton, who understood instantly, stepped forward with his shield and
axe.  
"Sir Vincent! Those who are isolated will be targeted!"  
"I'm sorry! Everyone, stay close together and prepare for attacks from
above!"  
Vincent, who had been stunned by the surprise attack, also gave
instructions to his men while raising his shield at Dalton's voice.  
  
Normally, it would be the scout's job to detect the enemy's attacks, but
the response was delayed because Alia, who would have done that, was not
there. Even so, Miranda, a Forest Elf with a hundred years of experience
and a ranger as well, was able to deal with the situation without being
caught off guard.  
Wyverns are formidable rank 4 enemies, but even without mages and
scouts, they can handle about five of them.  
  
"They're coming from the front too!"  
But then, four more Wyverns were approaching from the rocky mountain
where the heroes had gone.  
Even though they are considered sub dragons, Wyverns are monsters, not
mythical beasts, and their intelligence is not as high as that of true
dragons. Therefore, they did not think that they would take actions such
as "hiding in groups," which led to their carelessness.  
No, the one to be feared was the Attribute Dragon, which perfectly
controlled the low-intelligence sub dragons. They did not know what
happened on the rocky mountain, but at least the Fire Dragon regarded
the humans who visited this place as enemies.  
  
"Jesha, protect Mira! Feld and I will beat down anyone who comes
down!"  
***"Oooooh!"***  
Now that the mage Snow was not there, the only ones who could defeat the
Wyverns in the sky was Miranda, an archer and Spirit Mage. The Temple
Knights could also use bows, but the possibility of penetrating the
thick hide was low, so Jesha, wielding a large shield, guarded Miranda,
who could be the target of a concentrated attack.  
However, Wyverns cannot breathe flames like fire, and their attacks are
their giant claws and fangs, and the poisonous stinger at the tip of
their tails.  
Therefore, in order to attack, they must come down to the ground, which
was the opportunity Dalton and the others were waiting for, but the
problem was their attack power.  
Jesha, a Dwarf and a Rank 4 warrior, could withstand it. However, aside
from Vincent, who was Rank 4, the Temple Knights, who were Rank 3, could
be crushed even if they blocked with their shields.  
  
Nine Wyverns circled in the sky, and swooped down on the Temple Knights,
looking for openings.  
"―【Slash】―"  
Feld made an instant decision. Seeing that, he leaped out, not thinking
about being attacked, and used a Combat Skill to cut off the Wyvern's
wings.  
Combat Skills, which cause a slight rigidity after use, are difficult to
use in a melee. Alia, who often fought alone, only used Combat Skills
when she could definitely defeat the enemy, but Feld, like an
adventurer, trusted his comrades and tried to reduce the number of
enemies for sure by using Combat Skills.  
Even so, if multiple Wyverns attacked at the same time, the people who
were on the defensive would be at a disadvantage.  
  
"They're coming!"  
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaah!"  
One of the Wyverns that had jumped in ignored the slight wounds and
swooped down, sweeping away one of the Temple Knights with its giant
tail.  
As he flew through the air screaming, another Wyvern was about to claw
at him in mid-air, when―  
  
"―【Cross Blade】―"  
  
A figure leaped in at high speed, slicing off the Wyvern's wings and
neck in mid-air.  
That person was―  
  
"Sir Neidhardt!"  
At Vincent's cry, the swordsman Neidhardt, who had landed, frowned and
shook off the blood from his sword, pointing it at the Wyverns in the
sky.  
"I came here for you incompetent fools! You should be grateful!"  
It was an arrogant way of speaking, but his participation created a
chance for victory. But what happened to the battle with the Fire
Dragon, where Neidhardt should have been?  
"He's an irritating guy, but a Hero wouldn't be outdone by a mere
dragon, would he? You'll hear the Fire Dragon's screams soon enough."  
The Hero's party aren't exactly friends, but they trust each other's
abilities. As if to prove it, the Fire Dragon's scream could be heard
again from the rocky mountain.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
"...Did I mishear? It sounded like you were going to fight me?"  
  
The Hero Klein, who had suddenly regained his senses, smiled cheerfully
at us with eyes that were not smiling at all.  
Who does he think he is, after doing all this?  
  
"That's what we said."  
"Heeh..."  
A murderous pressure emanated from Klein, who was still smiling
faintly.  
The power of the "Hero," which we still could not measure... The injured
Fire Dragon, even on the ground, braced itself against the unpleasant
presence that filled the space.  
"How did you get back to normal?"  
"Can something perfectly bind a person's heart?"  
At that question, Alia wiped the blood flowing from her forehead, which
she had struck and injured herself, with her thumb, and calmly held up
her knife and dagger. Klein's mouth twisted slightly.  
  
...Only you could say that, Alia.  
It looked like a technique that only loosened with pain, but we couldn't
avoid it, and we couldn't resist it. If that's the Spirit's
【Blessing】, then it's a terrifying technique that you can only escape
by injuring yourself until you understand how to deal with it.  
But I saw it, you know? You were able to move because your face was
slapped by the whisker of kitty-chan who jumped out of the shadows,
right? There's no need to honestly tell him that, but wouldn't 【Phantom
Pain】 be enough to undo the curse?  
  
"Well, it's true that it's harder to affect people whose hearts are less
likely to waver."  
Klein said that with a wry smile, and then pointed his finger at us.  
"That would be a problem."  
"―!"  
The last time, we were almost manipulated by that action alone, without
any warning. But this time, it's not that.  
"Either way, some training is needed."  
  
A strong light gathered at Klein's fingertips. It wasn't magic. If it
was the same Spirit-derived 【Blessing】 as the "Charm" and
"Brainwashing" from before, then this was "Restraint."  
The Blessing of Darkness binds the mind, and the Blessing of Light binds
the body. If that's really a blessing, then we'll be imprisoned again.  
As I raised the mana in my body so that I could resist immediately, Alia
looked at me for a moment.  
Ah... I see.  
  
Thump!  
"Have you given up, Alia!"  
Klein scoffed at Alia, who jumped out towards him without avoiding it.
The moment the particles of light released from his fingertips enveloped
Alia―  
***"Gaaaaaaah!!"***  
The little cat, which jumped out of Alia's shadow, spewed out a huge
amount of dark mana like a breath towards the light.  
"What!?"  
Light and darkness opposed each other. Kitty-chan had been wary of Klein
all along. Even when our minds were bound, it didn't show itself, and
only provided the minimum amount of support for Alia.  
When the Hero became an enemy, it hid its existence until the very last
moment.  
However, Klein, while surprised, immediately reached for his sword with
one hand.  
The attack that defeated the Fire Dragon earlier could intercept
kitty-chan.  
But you see―  
  
"Tch―"  
The sword was frozen as if it was bound to the scabbard. Klein... You're
being too careless. Taking your eyes off me.  
The 【Ice Whip】, which had been sneaking up from directly below, froze
the sword, stopping its movement for a moment.  
Just a moment... But that's enough, right? Alia.  
  
"You!"  
"Haa!"  
At that moment, Alia, using kitty-chan's body as a stepping stone and
leaping over it, slashed at Klein's head with a knife, taking advantage
of a momentary opening.

The battle with the Hero has finally begun.  
What is his true strength!?
