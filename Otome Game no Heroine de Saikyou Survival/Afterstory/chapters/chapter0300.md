## 300 The Meaning of Life

"Snow\!\!"  
Alia cried out my name as I dealt the final blow to the Hero, Klein.  
Just a little longer, Alia… It'll be over soon.  
Despite crushing his heart, it was still faintly moving. Truly a Hero… Saving the world seems more like a curse. If I leave him be, will he regenerate even from this?  
"…*Die*."  
A lightning bolt, along with an activation word akin to a curse mixed with murderous intent, incinerated his heart to dust. I cast Klein's corpse aside as if shaking blood from my hands. A glowing haze-like substance rose from his body before vanishing somewhere.  
Ah… Is that the "Blessing" of the Spirit of Light? To finally die after all this, isn't that truly a curse?  
"…………"  
I don't think even his soul remains, but just in case, and a little out of spite, I pointed my blood-soaked hands toward Klein’s corpse, intending to completely destroy the body.

"Snow\!"  
Alia grabbed my wrist. The grip, strong enough to break bones, felt so gentle.  
"Why are you stopping me?"  
"Don't use magic anymore."  
Your eyes, glaring and scolding. The lonely, beast-like eyes from when we first met are so beautiful and dazzling now.  
Ah, so that's how it was. Back then, you weren't glaring; you were scolding me. How foolish of me to only realize it now.

"I know… would you lend me a flame? I'd like to burn it."  
"…Is he not dead?"  
When I asked with a faint smile, Alia's eyes cautiously darted toward Klein's corpse with the hole in its chest.  
"No, he's dead. I made *sure* to kill him."

The Blessing of Light bestowed upon the Hero.  
A spiritual blessing that forbids even death for the sake of saving the world.  
A Hero grows eternally, fights perpetually, and even in death, continues to fight.  
That's why I made sure to kill him properly.

"A curse…"  
A faint crease formed between Alia's eyebrows at my words.  
"Yes, that's right."  
The grace given to the Hero, the Blessing of the Great Spirit of Light. Only naive clerics and children would think of it as something holy.  
But just as spirits and demons are natural enemies, if you consider that spirits hold a "positive" attribute that governs life, then to resist that blessing and definitively halt all life activity, the exact opposite, a "negative" attribute, is necessary.

Magic can be used like a spell without reciting a long incantation, but it still requires an "activation word" to solidify the spell's formula.  
It can be used without one, but since the effect of magic on the world is so different, it's best to use an activation word, even if you just yell it out.  
For example, using formal magic names like *Fire Arrow* or *Water Sphere* is to more clearly define the magic with the caster's will.

An activation word isn't just a chant. It's the caster's very will, manifesting a "miracle"—magic that defies physical laws—into the world.  
So, I used the "curse" of "killing intent", poured my negative emotions into it, and subtly transformed a small amount of mana into miasma.  
Perhaps the "Dark Magic" that demons use is of this same system?

I was lucky to be here. Or, from Klein's perspective, was he unlucky? Only I, who has lived with negative emotions, could do this. It would be impossible for Alia.  
Cere’zhula might have been able to, but I doubt she would. She would know that handling miasma itself puts a burden on the caster's body.

"Release the 'Gift,' Snow."  
Alia's eyes stared straight into mine.  
Yes, I know, Alia.  
As long as I don't use magic, the burden isn't great, but even just having "Soul Thorn" active consumes my life force.  
It'll be soon… You'll know right away.

"Alia… do you trust me?"  
"…What are you saying?"  
I know that's what you'll say. But…  
"I trust you. More than anything in this world."  
"Snow…?"  
A momentary gap in your heart… A faint hope that you would entrust your heart to someone like me.  
"—【Sleep】—"

At that moment, black thorns drew a vast amount of aether from my soul, attacking Alia who tried to resist in that brief instant.  
The Level 6 Dark Magic, 【Sleep】… A magic that should be almost ineffective on the strong-willed Alia, worked by exploiting that split-second gap.

"Snow…\!"  
She resisted the magic even as she fell to one knee.  
***"GAAAAHHH\!"***  
The blood-covered kitty-chan noticed and bared its fangs at me.  
"…You ‘rest’ too."  
Using that as the activation word, I trapped the little cat in the "shadow" of 【Shadow Walker】.  
"What… Snow…"  
It's okay to sleep. But it's alright, they've already arrived.

"—Klein\!\!"  
At that moment, a voice echoed through the fire dragon's nest surrounded by rock walls. The person let out a strained voice at the scene before him.  
"…What is this?\!"  
Sir Neidhardt, the Sword Saint. The swordsman of the Hero's party.  
Reflected in his astonished eyes were: the injured, fallen fire dragon; the scorched rock surface from the fire dragon's breath; the wounded, kneeling Alia; the fallen body of their comrade, the warrior Douglas; the corpse of the Hero, Klein, with a gaping hole near his heart…  
And…  
"…Did you kill the Hero\!"  
Standing above it all, a phantom-like *woman* dressed in a blood-red gown, with deathly white skin, deep shadows under her eyes, and dull black hair; Mocking the sword he had just drawn.

In that instant, Neidhardt charged at a speed that blurs vision.  
"Die\!\!"  
The blow from a frontline fighter with a combat power close to four thousand. The Rank 6 sword slash, moving fast enough to cleave space itself, sliced through the “woman”.  
But…  
"No."  
The “woman” melted away like an illusion. At that same moment, her black hair flowed like snakes as she gripped Neidhardt's face. The abnormal strength of her slender arm, wrapped in black thorns, smashed his head into the rocky ground.  
THUD\!\!  
"Guh\!"  
Neidhardt groaned at the impact that shattered the rock.  
Using the rebound from the immense shock, he shook her arm off and created distance, but he fell to one knee from the severe damage in the process.  
"You… who *are* you?\!"

Hearing that, I couldn’t help but laugh, all while wrapped in thorns from head to toe.  
Yes, that's right. I left you alive for this. The one who killed the "Hero," humanity's hope, wasn't Alia or the adventurer woman in white.

"You won't… get away\!"  
A wind infused with mana enveloped Neidhardt's body as if to wipe the blood from his face.  
A "Hero-class" warrior who received a spirit's gift to fight alongside the Hero… Yes… That's your hidden trump card, isn't it?  
Without even needing to appraise him, Neidhardt's combat power skyrocketed.  
I could counter him if I used magic. But now is not the time.  
At that moment, I sensed a faint flow of magic and a "will." Yes, you're right… You too hold a grudge against those who ally with the Hero.  
Very well. I'll yield this to you.

***"GRAAAHHRRAGHAGHAGGHH\!\!"***  
The fire dragon, which had been lying down, its life functions reduced to a minimum to focus on recovery, suddenly raised its head and breathed flames.  
"Damn it\!"  
The "wind" Neidhardt was about to use collided with the dragon's breath, cancelling each other out.

*〈—My Daughter—〉*  
The fire dragon's whisper reached my ears. Our eyes met, and I jumped onto its neck as it prepared to take flight.  
While mounted on the dragon, Alia, who was still conscious, pierced me with a sharp glare.  
It hurts… It really does.  
But this is enough. This is the reason I live.  
Because I swore to use my life for you.
