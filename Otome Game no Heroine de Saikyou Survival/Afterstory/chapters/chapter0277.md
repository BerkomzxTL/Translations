## 277 Approaching the Viscounty

The Dandorl Frontier Margravate, known as the Northern Capital. It had
always prospered as a center of trade, but a few years ago, unusual
products for women began to appear.  
New cosmetics, clothing, and household goods. Initially, they were only
accepted by adventurous women who liked new things, but they quickly
spread among noble ladies and female knights, gaining strong support,
especially among relatively wealthy young women.  
"...Come to think of it, that dwarf armor shop owner recommended a lot
of things to me."  
"Is that so?"  
"Alia... what you're wearing is one of them, isn't it?"  
Alia truly has little interest in such things...  
  
Anyway, until then, cosmetics meant fragrant oils and face powder, and
underwear was of the drawers type. In rural villages, it was normal not
to have underwear until over ten years old, but now, from expensive
items for nobles to cheap ones for commoners, anyone can get them if
they wish.  
The Dandorl family created the first of these products. Rumor has it
that it was a young lady who wasn't even ten years old yet.  
  
The place we arrived at is a small viscounty, a few days south of the
Dandorl territory.  
One town, two post towns. And then just ten villages and large cotton
fields. It seems it was originally a direct territory of the Dandorl
family, too small even for a barony.  
As far as Alia investigated, this land, which was governed by a
quasi-baron, a vassal of the Dandorl family, was a place for making new
products for the Dandorl family, but this land was made into the
territory of a new, young viscount.  
  
"...Indeed, the young lady has favored us, and we all truly looked
forward to her becoming the queen, but if she's to become the lord of
this land, then we must support her."  
The old man at a stall in the post town (Samantha's child's generation)
said so with deep emotion.  
Samantha, who is much older than the quite elderly old man, tried to
charge into the tavern as soon as we arrived at the post town, and was
restrained by Alia's pendulum.  
"Samantha. If you're going to drink, do it while eating something."  
"More massive amounts of lamb!? A demon wife!"  
...Is this what peace means?  
  
Anyway, perhaps because it was originally a direct territory, and she
gave them work and showed her face many times, that young lady seems to
be adored by the villagers.  
By the way, the lord of this "Rovino Viscounty" is the former prince,
but I wonder if the villagers don't even know his face?  
Well, given the circumstances, they probably won't appear on the public
stage as nobles in their generation. Still, it's better than potentially
dying in the battle between me, Alia, and the demon, so just being alive
and not confined is good enough.  
Though, it's not something I, who tried to kill everyone in the royal
capital, can say.  
  
"Snow. I'm going to show my face at the Adventurer's Guild, what about
you?"  
"What about that old woman?"  
When Alia said that, I tilted my head, wondering about the old woman who
had disappeared at some point.  
"Samantha is old, so I'll have her stay at a nearby inn today. I think
she's probably drinking on her own."  
"Well... I guess that's fine?"  
  
Come to think of it, you're right. Alia was treating Samantha like a
normal old person, and that surprised me more.  
"More importantly, is there an Adventurer's Guild in such a small post
town?"  
"They're usually in the lord's town, but these post towns also have
substations with equipment for emergency contact."  
"Oh, really...?"  
  
Long-distance magic tools are expensive because they use valuable
adamantite, but the price seems to be proportional to the communication
distance. In such a small territory, there's apparently only one in the
capital's guild that can communicate with the royal capital.  
However, that's for making calls. If it's just for sending short
messages, like the ones at the Sorcerer's Academy, they can be placed in
these post towns by substituting mithril.  
Well, since they're military supplies, not anyone can buy them; ordinary
people need national permission.  
  
"Here it is."  
While talking about such things, we found the Adventurer's Guild
substation.  
How to put it... it's just a private house. Inside, there was only one
middle-aged male staff member, and a man who looked like a traveling
merchant was talking to him.  
The Guild substation also buys magic stones from low-rank monsters
defeated by traveling adventurers, villagers, and travelers, apparently.
If you're just selling magic stones, it's a bit more expensive, but you
don't need adventurer registration.  
I wonder if this merchant also came to sell magic stones, or to make a
request? As I watched, it didn't seem like such a peaceful atmosphere.  
  
"―So, please do something about it already!"  
"Therefore, you need to tell such matters to the guard post or the
lord."  
"I have told them, but it's been a long time!"  
"The number of soldiers is limited, you see... I think we just have to
wait for a knight to come from Dandorl."  
"When will that be!?"  
"The lord has indeed put out a request, but there's no one to accept
it."  
  
"...What happened?"  
It seemed like it would turn into trouble, but sensing that the
conversation wouldn't end, Alia spoke up, and the merchant turned around
before the staff member.  
"Young ladies, are you adventurers? If so, please take care of those
bandits!"  
"Hey, you! What are you saying to these young ladies!?"  
Rather than ignoring the guild, the sensible staff member started
arguing with the merchant who tried to push bandit extermination onto
two young women.  
Well, it can't be helped. Alia is cute.  
  
"'What happened?'"  
  
""―!?""  
The two froze at Alia's repeated words, spoken without changing her
expression or tone. Perhaps even a Rank 3 monster would freeze...  
"Actually..."  
The staff member explained.  
Bandits have been appearing frequently in this area recently. I thought
bandits were just good-for-nothing farmers who didn't get land, or a
side job for rural villages during the off-season, but according to the
merchant who interrupted, there's someone powerful among them, and they
seem quite organized.  
In short, these guys, who are bandits in name only, like a squad of
soldiers or a mercenary group, are attacking only merchant caravans, not
even bothering with travelers.  
They know this territory is making a lot of money, and they're clearly
targeting it.  
Are they really *bandits*...?  
  
There are soldiers in this territory, but their numbers are limited in
this small viscounty, so it must be tough. If a small number of soldiers
were to patrol the roads, they might be ambushed and wiped out by the
organized bandits.  
The Dandorl family should have assigned a knight squad for their
daughter and the former prince, but for them, the protection of the two
takes priority, and their numbers aren't large either.  
Apparently, the young lady has also put out a request to the
Adventurer's Guild, but ever since a Rank 2 adventurer was ambushed and
defeated, even Rank 3 adventurers are hesitant, the staff member
explained.  
  
"Snow."  
"Yes, yes."  
Can't be helped... She doesn't trust others, yet she can't leave them
alone.  
Honestly, I don't care. I have no interest in toys I've let go of.  
But... if that's what you want, I'll gladly go to the depths of hell.  
  
"We'll take that request."  
When Alia said that, the staff member and the merchant looked surprised,
but when Alia showed her Rank 5 tag, they widened their eyes and fell
silent.  
Besides... I said "others," but they're not really strangers. I owe the
princess a little something too.
