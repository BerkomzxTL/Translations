## 273 Long Time No See, Royal Capital

"You are..."  
The giant mountain dwarf in front of me looked at me with a horrified
expression and half-rose from the sofa. ...Well, I can imagine what he's
thinking. Being the leader of an adventurer party must be tough.  
  
Alia, kitty-chan, and I cleared the large dungeon.  
I thought the spirit might complain after we defeated the Chimera, but
unlike humans, it didn't seem interested in what had already happened,
and since Alia and the little cat didn't have any particular wishes, we
were able to exit the dungeon safely.  
But can I really call it "safe"? Alia couldn't move for about two days
at the inn, and the little cat didn't come out of Alia's shadow
either.  
If even those two were like that, I was bedridden for over five days.
...I ended up having to drink Alia's special medicine again.  
My six attributes have become four, and my magic stone should shrink
from now on, but I have a feeling it might actually be a little larger
than a normal four-attribute one.  
Since I synthesized attributes, it can't be helped. Still, it should be
smaller than five attributes, so let's be happy that I get to spend a
little more time with Alia.  
  
"No? Dalton."  
When Alia asked the mountain dwarf... Dalton of "Rainbow Blade," he
settled back onto the sofa and glared at her with a troubled
expression.  
That's understandable. It looks like trouble no matter how you slice
it.  
  
After our... mainly my health recovered enough for us to move, we first
headed to the mansion of Dalton, the leader of "Rainbow Blade" in the
royal capital.  
The other members weren't there, but Dalton was home, and Alia
introduced me to Dalton as "the high-ranked mage the party was looking
for."  
Dalton was surprised, but so was I... because I didn't think she was
serious.  
  
"Alia... I understand what you're trying to say. But still..."  
Dalton said that, shifting his gaze from Alia to me. My hair color has
changed, and the dark circles under my eyes have faded considerably, but
it seems people who know me will still be suspicious. He and I didn't
have much of an acquaintance, but perhaps it's precisely because he
doesn't know my face that he senses a connection?  
After the battle in the royal capital, Alia disappeared with my body,
and then a few months later, she brought a high-ranked mage. Anyone with
good intuition would notice.  
  
"If Viro leaves, our combat power will be unbalanced. If I become a
scout, won't Mira be the only mage left, and we'll be short?"  
"We were indeed looking for a mage... and Rank 6 at that? And you two
cleared a large dungeon? What are you thinking, you two?"  
"Not two. Three, with Nero."  
"...What kind of party is that...?"  
Dalton, who was looking up at the ceiling, making the large sofa creak,
seemed more exasperated than troubled.  
  
"I also have my doubts."  
"Snow?"  
Alia and Dalton turned their gaze to me at my words.  
Alia must have thought a lot and this was the conclusion she reached,
but she's not very articulate. I'm the same, and that's our flaw from
having always worked alone.  
"The royal capital hasn't fully recovered yet. If I, the culprit, am
alive, it will cause trouble for your comrades."  
It's not my style to mourn the dead now, and I don't regret killing my
enemies one bit. That's why it's impossible for me, a truly evil person,
to join Alia's party.  
"I am an "evil person," so there is a "way of life" befitting that."  
I'm grateful that she saved my life, but I don't want to be by Alia's
side if it means causing her trouble.  
But―  
  
"Don't run away."  
Alia looked at me steadily, her expression unchanged.  
"Take responsibility for what you've done. The life of revenge is over.
Now, live as you please. But before that, settle things. This party can
make use of your power."  
Alia told me to come out into the open world, not to become like
Cere’zhula, who could only live by killing in the underworld. She stood
up from the sofa and stood before me, bending down to look into my
eyes.  
"Don't be afraid. If you stray from the path, I'll kill you again."  
"...Yes. If it's you who kills me, then it's fine."  
The same promise as before. But the difference is, I want to die for
you.  
  
"Haaahhhhhhhhh...Alright."  
Dalton, who had been listening to our exchange, let out a long sigh and
turned his furrowed brow towards us.  
"Snow... is that what I should call you?"  
"Yes, that's fine."  
"Honestly, it's hard for me to trust you. But if Alia says so much, then
I'll brace myself. It's certainly better to keep you where I can see
you."  
"It's alright. I won't betray Alia."  
When I smiled, Dalton's expression, conversely, soured.  
"Alia!! Keep a close eye on her! And get a full set of equipment made at
Gelf's place! As for the others, you persuade them... no, find them and
call them here."  
"Understood."  
"For the time being, we'll keep the Rank 6 mage thing under wraps. The
attributes too. Snow will be registered as a Rank 5 mage with Light,
Dark, Water, and Wind attributes. Got it?"  
"That's fine."  
  
Dalton is quite the hard worker, isn't he? He seems used to it, as if
he's only ever had troublesome members.  
It seems everyone is going for the party registration. Are they all
going to intimidate them to cover up various things?  
  
"I'm a noble, so I can't leave the royal capital while it's still
recovering. Even so, we still get requests. Until now, I've sent whoever
was free, but this time, you two take the request and leave the royal
capital."  
"Indeed, it's better if I'm not in the royal capital right now."  
When I replied, Dalton sighed again.  
"...Why are all our mages problem children? While you're on the quest,
go to Samantha's place and have her teach you how the party operates."  
Ah, I've heard of her. The retired mage of Rainbow Blade, the Sandstorm
Witch, wasn't it?  
  
"Understood. Then, can Snow stay here?"  
Alia, who had nodded to Dalton, stood up again and said that.  
"Oh, are you going somewhere, Alia?"  
"I'm going to Elena's place. If I explain, she shouldn't take it
badly."  
  
Ah, yes, it's definitely better to talk to her.  
But... isn't she angry?  
  
＊＊＊  
  
When Alia arrived at the gate for authorized personnel, not the main
gate of the royal castle, the gatekeeper, who had already been
instructed by the princess and prime minister to give her top priority,
hurriedly called someone who knew her face, and she was then led
directly to the princess.  
  
"Alia... do you have anything to say?"  
"I'm sorry..."  
Alia honestly apologized to Elena's smile, which was a little thinner
than when she last saw her.  
Although Snow's resurrection happened, it seems Elena and Count Melrose,
the prime minister, had a lot of trouble because the person involved
disappeared. They must have been quite worried, even more so.  
"Go and let Count Melrose scold you honestly too."  
"I will."  
Alia's childlike honesty somewhat softened her anger, and she looked
around and clapped her hands lightly.  
"Please clear the room."  
  
Since Alia had been guarding the princess for over three years, there
were no particular problems, and only close retainers who knew the
situation, such as the maid Chloe and the butler Joseph, remained.  
Then, starting with Elena's complaints, she recounted everything that
had happened, scolding Alia here and there.  
She spoke of becoming the Crown Princess. Of Elvan's only fiancée now
being Clara, and the two becoming lords of a viscounty in the Dandorl
region. Of Mikhail and Rockwell officially becoming retainers, and so
on.  
And then, when it came to Alia's story...  
"...That's quite a mess you've gotten into."  
Elena pressed her temples as if she had a headache, and for now, decided
to overlook it... or rather, to keep it a secret as a matter that
couldn't be made public.  
"As Dalton said, it's better for you to stay away from the royal capital
for a while. I won't need a guard for some time, but I'd be happy if
you'd take on requests from the shadows."  
"Understood."  
  
Then the two chatted idly for a while, and when it was about time for
Alia's grandfather, the prime minister, to come flying in, Elena
continued as if remembering something.  
  
"Alia, I've heard a rumor through the shadows that a "Hero's" ship has
arrived from another continent in the Melrune National Federation in the
north of the continent."
