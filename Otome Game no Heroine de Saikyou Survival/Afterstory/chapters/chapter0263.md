## 263 Setting Off

"A dungeon?"  
I thought I misheard, but Alia seemed serious about heading to a
dungeon. And taking me with her, no less.  
"I'm just recovering from an illness, you know?"  
"You're better than before, aren't you?"  
Well, it's true that I'm much more comfortable than when I had all
attributes. I didn't realize it myself, but according to Alia, I'm
eating more too.  
Oh dear... what if I get fat?  
My complexion seems much better too. It's a small price to pay for a
level 5 attribute, but I suppose I should be glad.  
  
"What's the reason for going to a dungeon?"  
And then, I asked the most important question. I had a hunch, but Alia
said something so outrageous as if it were nothing.  
"To receive the dungeon's gift."  
"...Are you sane?"  
I never thought she'd actually consider tackling a dungeon by
ourselves...  
"Not just two of us. Nero's coming too."  
"Oh, is that so?"  
As if in response to Alia's words, a growl came from her shadow.  
Even so, it was still reckless. I've challenged dungeons since I was a
child, but there's a limit to what I can do alone, and I've only ever
cleared them halfway.  
Well, I suppose it can't be helped. I'll humor you until you're
satisfied.  
  
When I went to say goodbye to Cere’zhula, who had taken care of me, she
waved her hand dismissively and sent me off.  
"I'm too old for this, so I'm not thinking about reducing my attributes
now, but if it doesn't work out, don't push yourself, just tuck your
tail between your legs and run back... you reckless disciple."  
"...Yes. I'll do that."  
They're all such good-natured people, aren't they?  
  
And so, I left the forest with Alia and the little cat.  
We headed through the forest towards the town in the Sayles Barony. Not
just me, but Alia too, had her face hidden by a hood, apparently because
there might be people she knew.  
In that case, wouldn't it be better not to stop in town? I thought, but
Alia told me she planned to arrange a carriage, considering my health.  
"Your complexion is still bad, you know. If you don't get yourself in
shape by the time we reach the dungeon, I'll be in trouble."  
"First of all, which dungeon are you planning to go to?"  
  
The dungeon on the isolated island in Duke Hoodale's territory, where I
received my 【Gift】, is nearby, but you can only meet a spirit once in
a single dungeon.  
There's also a large-scale dungeon in Duke Luxton's territory in this
country, but not only would it be a considerable journey, it's a
high-difficulty dungeon where Wyverns appear and has never been cleared,
and I hear the royal family has given up on clearing it.  
In intermediate or lower dungeons, even if you can clear them, there are
no spirits. Perhaps there's a new dungeon where a spirit has been
born?  
  
When I asked this while eating a proper meal for the first time in a
while at a cheap food stall in town, Alia told me while eating her
vegetable stew.  
"We're heading to the large-scale dungeon managed by the Leicester
Countdom."  
"...Are you sane?"  
I unconsciously muttered the same words again, and this time, when I
placed my hand on Alia's forehead, the black cat on her shoulder slapped
my hand with its tail. ...Even illusions have a sense of touch, huh?  
  
The reason I used to dive into that dungeon was because it was the
easiest among the state-owned large-scale dungeons.  
That's why the former Crown Prince's party also cleared that dungeon.
Only a few years have passed since then, so there might still be few
monsters, and the difficulty might have decreased.  
But―  
"I think there are still many people there who remember my face,
though?"  
  
Having made that place my base since childhood, my face was known both
openly and secretly.  
If I were to be discovered, regardless of what happens to me, Alia,
whose face is known as a famous adventurer, would probably have her
reputation tarnished.  
  
"That's why I'll be in trouble if you don't get yourself in better
shape. Here, take this."  
"............"  
Alia said that and handed me a pungent medicine in a copper flask, and
despite having just eaten a proper meal, I grimaced and swallowed the
medicine.  
"...There are rumors that the spirit of that dungeon isn't very friendly
to people."  
Perhaps it's more accurate to say it doesn't quite understand people.
That's why wishes were misinterpreted, and Amor and Nathanial gained
such powers.  
"This will be your third time clearing it, right? Negotiate well. You
just need to focus on healing your body. You can even use my wish."  
"I wonder what I should do..."  
Since I was made to drink bitter medicine, I used slightly mischievous
words, and Alia glared at me with just her eyes.  
"I'll get seriously angry."  
"I can't stand it if you increase the bitter medicine."  
  
Alia's eccentric actions are probably the result of her thinking things
through logically, but since Alia is a woman of few words, those around
her end up being tossed around.  
Such were my thoughts on the journey to the capital.  
We could get there faster by taking a dangerous road, but choosing a
road safe for carriages would take over three weeks. On a proper
highway, there are no bandits, so it's boring.  
It would be nice if I could read a book, but my assets are frozen. After
all, a dead person can't withdraw money deposited with the Adventurer's
Guild.  
I think there might be something left if I could return to my hidden
base, but then it's tough that I'm forbidden from using "Soul Thorn."  
  
In my 【Shadow Storage】, I had several large gold coins along with my
clothes, but everything inside had disappeared.  
Is it because I died once...? I thought it was just expanding space, but
it might be something closer to spatial transfer.  
It's a scary thought, but I just have to think it's better than it
exploding inside my stomach.  
So, I'm currently penniless. My clothes and travel are all up to Alia,
and I've borrowed about ten gold coins, but I can't waste money, can I?
So, the only thing I can do to pass the time is write a diary in this
blank book.  
  
We traveled south, bypassing the royal capital, and arrived at a dungeon
town without any particular sentiment.  
The management was still by the Leicester Countdom, but according to
Alia, my mother, who had lost her entire family, had returned to her
family home, and a distant branch family had become the new Count
Leicester.  
It doesn't really matter, but I won't be able to read forbidden books
anymore. However, I remember most of them, so I'll just turn them into
books and spread them around eventually.  
  
"We're going to the Adventurer's Guild."  
"...Alright."  
It's too much trouble to comment on everything, but what is she
planning?  
As we entered, many gazes from the adventurers inside turned towards us,
perhaps recognizing us as two young women even with our cloaks on.  
"How may I help you?"  
Alia deliberately went to the counter where an old man was, and when she
took off her hood, the old man blinked.  
"Oh, it's been a long time. Do you remember me?"  
"Of course. Do you remember me?"  
"There aren't many young people here, you know. Are you going to dive
into the dungeon again after so long?"  
Apparently, this old man was acquainted with Alia, and he had a kind
face, like a relative's child had come to visit after a long time.  
"Yeah. I'll be diving into the dungeon for a long time, so I'd like you
to register the one behind me as an adventurer."  
"For a long time, you say...? I understand about registering her as an
adventurer. There's a rank examination, but..."  
"That's to be done at the royal capital's guild. For now..."  
At that, Alia glanced at me, so I created ice on the spot and placed it
on the counter, which made the receptionist old man look surprised.  
"Ice... are you a mage?"  
However... seeing my skill in producing ice without incantation, the old
man narrowed his eyes suspiciously, as if remembering something.  
"...Is this your first time here?"  
"Yes, it is."  
"Then, would you please remove your hood and show your face?"  
  
I don't remember... but he might have met "me" before.  
It's fine to show my face, but what should I do? I glanced at Alia, the
opposite of before, and when Alia nodded, I gave up and took off my
hood.  
At worst... perhaps I'll have Alia kill me.  
  
"This is... my apologies. It seems I was mistaken..."  
The old man, seeing my face, wiped the sweat from his brow and bowed his
head.  
"Alia...?"  
I looked at Alia, wondering what was going on, and she silently pointed
behind me.  
There, adventurers were staring at me with dumbfounded expressions, and
one of them muttered under his breath.  
"Amazing... she's like snow."  
He might have come from somewhere far north.  
My black hair had turned silver-white, and my sallow skin had also
become white. Not only that, but my face seemed to have changed quite a
bit in impression due to improved circulation.  
  
"So, young lady. What name will you use?"  
Hearing the old man speak as if addressing a noble lady rather than an
adventurer, Alia also let a small smile play on her lips and spoke.  
  
"...'Snow'... will do."  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Her name will be unified as Snow.
