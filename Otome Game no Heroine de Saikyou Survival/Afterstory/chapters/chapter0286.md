## 286 Holy City Faan

"You must be Adventurer Alia-sama and your companions. I've come to meet
you."  
  
Several days after entering the Fandora Theocracy, the Holy Church's
main temple, we arrived at the first post town... should I call it the
entrance to the pilgrimage? Upon arriving in that town, we were greeted
by a Holy Knight who introduced himself as an escort from the Holy
Church.  
"I'm Dalton of the adventurer party "Rainbow Blade." I apologize for
being "companions," but would you mind speaking through me?"  
"My apologies, Dalton-dono. My name is Vincent. I see... the champion
seems to be quite young."  
  
A Rank 4 with around a thousand combat power... something like that, I
suppose.  
The middle-aged man, who seemed to be the representative of the Holy
Knights, apparently saw through Dalton's attempt to shield Alia,
realizing she was the champion-class "Alia."  
I'd like to say he's sharp-eyed... but it's only natural for someone who
came to pick up a "candidate for the Hero's party," isn't it? But...  
"Snow."  
Alia, who was next to me, murmured my name.  
...I know. I wouldn't kill someone just for insulting me a little. I
wouldn't do it in a place where evidence would be left behind. How
rude.  
Still, he's not as rude as this Vincent.  
  
There's a faction trying to assassinate the Hero, and the Hero, knowing
this, set a trap for them, so the Holy Church isn't a monolithic entity.
Rumor has it that the noble society of the Holy Nation is even more of a
quagmire than Claydale's, but which side is this man on?  
Did he make that remark to insult Alia because he's infatuated with the
Hero and thinks an adventurer girl isn't suitable, or does he see the
Hero as a nuisance and doesn't want a Hero's party to form?  
Either way, he's defying the Hero's intentions.  
How that will play out when we meet the Hero... it's added a little more
fun.  
  
It's about a month until Holy City Faan, at the foot of the Holy
Mountain where the Hero is waiting.  
Since there's a Temple Knight guiding us, we won't be stopped along the
way, but with more people, it's quite a hassle. It's good that we almost
don't need to camp, but the journey won't be much faster since we'll be
using inns, which slows us down.  
Moreover, meals on the road take more time than for adventurers. Well,
they handle most of it, so it's not a bother, but when there's that kind
of time, there are other *troubles* too.  
  
"I would very much like to receive a lesson from Alia-dono, a
champion-class individual."  
That's what a young Holy Knight, seemingly Vincent's subordinate,
said.  
Well, it can't be helped. Both Alia and I are wearing monster-hide
cloaks, so it's difficult to appraise us without considerable skill.  
Perhaps they don't even have the 《Appraisal》 skill to begin with. For
those living our kind of life, appraisal is essential, but even among
adventurers, some don't learn it due to role division.  
  
"...Understood."  
Alia responded without a hint of annoyance.  
Since Dalton and Feld had hidden it, they still only saw Alia as a
freshly adult girl.  
As she stepped forward silently, Vincent, who had been watching the
young Holy Knight's words and actions without stopping them, narrowed
his eyes sharply. When Alia took off her cloak, gasps of admiration
escaped at her appearance, and then a few strained, almost screaming,
voices were heard.  
There were three people with Appraisal, including Vincent...  
"Then I'm coming, Alia-dono!"  
The challenging Holy Knight, oblivious to these reactions, raised his
sword still in its sheath.  
  
Goh―  
"―Ah."  
The young Holy Knight collapsed before he could even swing his sword
down.  
"............"  
"It can't be helped..."  
Vincent responded to Alia's silent gaze and had his other subordinates
retrieve the fallen Holy Knight.  
Normally, having been asked, one should show a certain level of skill
and "guide" them.  
However, the young Holy Knight couldn't even gauge the difference in
skill with Alia, and swung his sword still in its sheath, as if going
easy on her.  
It's pointless to give proper guidance to an opponent who can't even
understand such a skill difference.  
So Alia, in the instant he swung, finished him with a single step,
punching him in the jaw.  
  
After that, we were no longer looked down upon for being adventurers.
While there are also Rank 5 individuals like Dalton and Feld, it's
mainly due to Alia's extraordinary combat power and her lovely
appearance. The younger Holy Knights exude an atmosphere of reverence
just from that.  
However... only that Vincent continued to give us an appraising look.  
Even at "me." ...He's quite a troublesome man.  
  
And so we arrived at Holy City Faan. Despite being called a Holy City,
it's not all that different from other towns. Though, there are many
white plaster houses.  
And the biggest difference is this view...  
"That's..."  
"The "Holy Mountain.""  
Feld answered Alia's murmur.  
A tall mountain covered in white snow... We could see it along the way,
but upon entering this city, we could view Mount Kyrios, the main peak
of this continent, without anything obstructing our view.  
There's almost no business in the city. Vincent seemed to intend the
same, so we stayed one night at an inn in the city and then proceeded
directly to the Holy Church's main temple on the Holy Mountain.  
  
Holy City Faan is at the foot of the Holy Mountain, at the second
station, and the main temple is around the fourth station of the Holy
Mountain.  
We left early in the morning, but at this rate, we'll probably arrive
around noon. It can't be helped since it's north of Claydale, but the
altitude is also rising, and Jesha, who grew up in the desert, is
shivering from the cold.  
  
"Open the gates! We have brought Hero Alia-dono!"  
  
At Vincent's voice, who was leading on horseback, the large gates in the
high outer wall creaked open. After passing through a straight
tree-lined path and an area that seemed to be residences for believers,
we finally arrived at a large building that looked like the main
temple.  
The main temple was as large as a castle, but there was no king
inside.  
There is no king in the Fandora Theocracy. It's a country governed by
"law," not by a king.  
The Holy Nation is self-governed by the noble clergy. The highest
authority here is the Pope, chosen from the Cardinals, but we were
allowed to meet one of the Cardinals.  
  
"Welcome, esteemed guests."  
The Cardinal who greeted us in a solemn room was a man who looked about
fifty. I think his real age is much older given the size of his mana,
but contrary to his cheerful tone, he gave us an appraising look.  
His skill is about Rank 3, so he's someone who became a Cardinal through
political means.  
I probably think this person is part of the "Hero faction."  
  
In the room were us, a female priest accompanying the Cardinal, and a
Holy Knight guard.  
But the "Hero" wasn't there.  
"Shall we begin?"  
"Please wait a little longer. Soon―"  
  
...He's here. A strong presence felt even through the door. Those who
noticed it looked up, and the door they were staring at opened.  
"Ah, did I keep you waiting?"  
The man smiled genially with bright red eyes, then narrowed his eyes at
Alia, who was sitting on the sofa, and slowly stood next to the
Cardinal.  
"You're late, Klein."  
"My apologies."  
Hero Klein. The true Hero who came from another continent.  
Even this close, I still can't appraise him properly. He's quite a
monster, isn't he?  
"Then―"  
"Wait. Let me speak first."  
The Hero interrupted the Cardinal's words, and with a movement that made
his black hair sway, he advanced to Alia's side and knelt.  
"What...?"  
Alia glared at Klein with a suspicious look. Klein, unfazed by Alia's
pressure, took her hand and gently pressed his lips to it.  
  
"I won't beat around the bush. Please, become mine."

The Hero's sudden words.  
How will Alia and Snow react to those words?
