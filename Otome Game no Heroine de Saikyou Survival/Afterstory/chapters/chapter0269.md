## 269 Chimera

"...Chimera..."  
  
...I never thought such a being actually existed.  
"You know about it?"  
"Sort of..."  
Over 7000 total combat power... that's just insane. Even Alia couldn't
take her eyes off the Chimera, and kitty-chan was tensed up, growling.  
"I've only read about it in texts, though..."  
  
It was written in some of the Leicester family's books... not forbidden
books, but close to them.  
A creature not of nature. Not a monster that changed from an animal, nor
a phantom beast born as a powerful entity from the start. A guardian of
treasures nesting in ruins. A legendary existence rarer than even dragon
species, seen nowhere else.  
Because of this, common books state that it's a magical creature created
by the ancient elves who bestowed magic upon humans... but books close
to forbidden texts recorded something different.  
  
Why isn't this generally known?  
If you think about it, it's obvious...  
Human cities are built around "dungeons" to seal off danger and to gain
their blessings. What would happen if it were known that the dungeon's
will, the spirit that should bestow blessings, was creating the greatest
danger?  
I thought it was just one hypothesis, but seeing the situation so far,
I'm convinced it's the truth.  
Chimeras are born only from dungeons.  
  
Creak...  
The buckled metal door behind us was closing. That was because the
Chimera, the monster of the deepest part, had recognized us.  
"The door doesn't look like it'll open again."  
The deepest door is there for a final confirmation of intent. So once
you pass through it, the door closes after a certain amount of time and
won't open until the monster is defeated. But with the door in this
state, it's questionable whether it will open even if we defeat the
monster.  
At this rate, there's no way out unless someone gains the spirit's
blessing and opens the exit door. But to reach the altar at the back, it
seems we have no choice but to defeat the Chimera.  
  
"It's the same either way."  
Alia, who had been wary of the Rank 7's appearance, seemed to have
steeled her resolve and began to quietly loosen her body.  
"You're right..."  
We came here for my "wish." If it doesn't come true, all three of us
might die here. Even so, Alia says what we have to do is "the same"...  
Never give up. Crush everything that stands in our way and move
forward.  
Honestly, she's so dependable.  
  
"Ready?"  
"Anytime."  
***"Gaa."***  
It's our first enemy, so there's no special preparation. But we always
live ready to fight. It's no different than usual.  
"―【Blessing】―"  
I boosted the defenses of Alia and the little cat, who had started
moving, and at that moment, I pointed my finger at the Chimera from
between the two who had split left and right.  
"―【Lightning】―"  
  
Lightning burst forth from my fingertip with a flash.  
First, a test. Honestly, just the three of us exceed the combat power
that participated in the large dungeon on that isolated island.  
But the monster at the deepest part back then was Rank 6. Alia has
defeated an attribute dragon, which is Rank 7, but the situation and our
combat power are different now.  
If there's a concern... it's "me" myself.  
  
***"GIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
Just before the lightning struck, the Chimera roared, releasing mana to
diminish its force, and used countless overflowing beast torsos like
arms to deflect the lightning.  
How troublesome. It has intelligence.  
  
"Over here!"  
At that instant, Alia, who had approached, unleashed multiple pendulums,
crushing the monkey's head and tearing the great deer's throat.  
***"GIGAAAAH!!"***  
But even with one or two of its multiple heads crushed, the Chimera
didn't flinch. It immediately swung its wolf upper body at Alia,
slamming it down as if to crush an insect.  
But―  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
With a momentary delay, kitty-chan delivered a powerful blow from the
opposite side.  
Was that the 【Claw Attack】 combat art?  
The Chimera's body was greatly gouged by the combat art unleashed by the
Rank 6 phantom beast. But in exchange, the little cat, having just used
a combat art, couldn't defend against the Chimera's attack due to the
post-combat art rigidity.  
  
"―【Critical Edge】―"  
The next moment, Alia's combat art, which dodged the Chimera's attack
with the little cat's blow, pierced the Chimera from the opposite
side.  
***"GUGAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
That single blow deflected the attack on kitty-chan, and the Chimera let
out a roar of fury.  
This time, Alia was rigid and couldn't move. Simultaneously, the mana
released from its entire body blew away the two who had approached.
Both, having lost their balance, couldn't defend against the attack.  
  
"―【Ice Storm】―"  
As the Chimera released its mana, I unleashed an Ice Storm.  
【Ice Storm】 has no speed. As an area-of-effect attack, there's a risk
of hitting allies. That's why I waited for this timing.  
A full-power 【Ice Storm】 with added mana assailed the defenseless
Chimera, which had just released its own mana.  
But―  
  
"Nero, fall back!"  
―Understood―  
  
Alia and Nero took their distance in that opening. Normally, they would
pursue, but Alia unhesitatingly retreated, and Nero immediately followed
suit.  
"...It's truly troublesome."  
  
【Chimera】【Species: Demonic Beast】【Demonic Beast Type Rank 7】  
【Magic Power: 287/350】【Health: 976/1180】  
【Total Combat Power: 7306】  
  
Its health has barely decreased. Alia, the little cat, and I-each of our
last attacks had enough power to kill a low-ranking Rank 5 monster in
one hit.  
Its physical strength is high, but more than that, the Chimera, a fusion
of multiple monsters, not only makes physical damage difficult to
inflict, but with its multiple "eyes," it avoided all fatal blows. The
fact that its mana hasn't decreased much might also be because it's
absorbing from the magic-dense dungeon itself.  
Alia's grimace as she retreated must mean she also appraised it and came
to the same conclusion as me.  
  
Alia and the Chimera are a terrible match. It doesn't seem to feel pain,
and there's no clear weak point. Alia's weapons are too small for a
giant body the size of a two-story house...  
I'm in a similar boat. Even with Ice Storm, only the surface froze.
Small magic won't do any significant damage.  
To defeat it, we need magic of level 7 or higher.  
There's a possibility if I use my blessing, but...  
"Snow."  
At that moment, Alia called my name as if reading my thoughts.  
...I know. I promised.  
But... if you're going to die, I'll die instead.  
  
CRACK!  
***"GIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"***  
The Chimera roared, as if shattering its frozen hide.  
It had already started moving.  
Is this going to be a battle of attrition...?  
Alia must be thinking the same, which is why she hasn't used Iron Rose
or Illusory Magic.  
If grand magic isn't an option, we'll act as decoys, inflicting small
amounts of damage, and kitty-chan will chip away at the Chimera's
health.  
Either our magic runs out, or the Chimera's health runs out.  
As we thought this and prepared to move, we were made to realize that
our thinking was "naive."  
A Rank 7 monster couldn't possibly be "normal."  
  
***"GIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"***  
THUD!!  
The Chimera, freed from its frozen state, suddenly leaped out like an
arrow.  
The Chimera, which hadn't moved from its initial position until now,
used its dozens of monster legs to move at a speed exceeding that of a
beast.  
  
"―【Iron Rose】...【World Rejection】―!"  
Alia was the one attacked.  
Alia immediately used Illusory Magic, dematerializing herself to evade
the attack.  
It's beyond a beast. Beasts leap using four legs. But the Chimera, with
its numerous legs, didn't sway up and down, constantly kicking the
ground, achieving terrifying speed.  
  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
***"GIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
Kitty-chan immediately moved to provide support. But the Chimera,
checking it with a head on its back, moved at a right angle without
changing its posture, sending the little cat flying.  
***"―Gaa."***  
Blood spurted from kitty-chan's entire body as it was blown away.  
All of that was from the nearly ten jaws that struck the moment it
collided.  
If even fur with steel-like strength takes that much damage, then if
Alia or I took a direct hit, we'd be gouged all over and die
instantly.  
Just like us, the Chimera had also been observing to gauge our combat
power.  
  
"―【Rock Blast】―"  
  
I also stopped holding back and fired an exploding rock projectile.  
"!?"  
At that moment, the rock shattered the dungeon floor, and the Chimera's
massive body, having dodged it by leaping, charged at me.  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
THUD!!  
The injured little cat body-slammed it from the side, slightly reducing
the Chimera's speed as it flew through the air.  
The next moment, Alia, using World Rejection, hugged me and moved away,
just as the Chimera's massive body crashed with a roar into the spot
where I had been.  
  
"...This is no joke."  
It's so ridiculous that all I can do is let out a dry laugh.  
"Do you have any ideas?"  
Alia, having released World Rejection, asked me while still holding
me.  
"Well..."  
If it really comes down to it, I'll use my gift. But Alia hasn't given
up yet.  
Alia never gives up, no matter who the enemy is.  
If I'm going to risk my life, even if it means breaking my promise to
her...  
  
"There's one thing I want to try."  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*\*\*\*"I have a great idea."  
  
What method did Snow come up with? It's not a death flag!  
  
"The Demon Princess 2" is now available nationwide. I hear some
bookstores are already running out! Get yours early!
