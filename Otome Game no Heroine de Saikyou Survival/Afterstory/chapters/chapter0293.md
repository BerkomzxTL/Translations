## 293 True Nature

"Hehehe, just kidding. Were you surprised?"  
The hero Klein laughed cheerfully, as if it was all a joke to surprise
us... while still holding the blood-soaked sword in his hand.  
  
"Snow..."  
"Yes, Alia."  
...It's not a joke. It's not about Klein killing his comrade. It's that
he didn't show any killing intent before he did it, nor does he now.  
Alia and I also don't hesitate to kill enemies, but even so, there's a
reason for taking someone's life, and there's the "will" to do it.  
But Klein did it as if it were natural, as if it were the most normal
thing in the world.  
And then he calls it just a "joke." But Klein frowned slightly at us as
we kept our distance, wary of him.  
  
"...Huh, that's weird. I thought you'd find it a bit more amusing."  
So Klein muttered, scratching his head with his free hand, looking
displeased.  
What he said about "wanting to kill" isn't a joke, it's his true
feeling. But, unfortunately, speaking from the perspective of someone
who's been called a "murderer," it seems like it's only a "part" of
him.  
He equates "murder" with things that are generally unacceptable, like
"enjoying mild drugs" or "enjoying malicious jokes," and treats it as a
joke, as a pretext to "entice innocent girls to drink."  
I shouldn't be saying this, but... is this guy crazy?  
  
"Well, I guess it can't be helped..."  
Klein sighed, directing the fingertips he'd been using to scratch his
head at us as we exuded a palpable tension.  
"Well, it's enough if you're this shaken."  
" "―!?" "  
In that instant―my thoughts, which had been wary and vigilant, were
numbed as if veiled in mist, and I felt a new "emotion" seeping in like
poison.  
This is―  
  
＊＊＊  
  
Klein was born in a certain kingdom on another continent.  
That kingdom was a small but peaceful country that had never been
invaded by a great power, and Klein, as the third son of a middle-class
noble family, was raised relatively freely, as he was exempt from the
succession struggle.  
  
But Klein had always harbored a strange dissatisfaction since he was a
child.  
A strange "memory" he was born with... A strange world he saw in his
dreams repeatedly since he was little.  
A world filled with convenient things, where you could get various
ingredients, and live a comfortable life without any inconvenience, a
peaceful and unstimulating world.  
In that "dream" world, Klein lived as another person, but that person,
like the current Klein, was always dissatisfied.  
A dreamlike world where you could get anything for money, and where you
wouldn't be inconvenienced if you had money. There, Klein, as a young
man, sought all kinds of stimulation, reached out to everything, and
ended up ending his life addicted to drugs, without having obtained
anything.  
  
Just a "dream"... But the craving he learned in that dream burned in the
heart of the young Klein, casting a dark shadow.  
Klein was left alone in this idyllic environment, unable to do anything
and consumed by dissatisfaction and longing, when suddenly a "spirit"
appeared before him.  
  
*"―I grant you the qualification of "Hero." Receive the spirit's
blessing and save this world―"*  
*"―Defeat the "evil" that will appear in this world, and strive to
maintain the world―"*  
  
He knew about the existence of the "Hero." He had heard such stories
from the priests at the Holy Church he had attended since he was a
child, read fairy tales, and children of the same age yearned for the
existence of the Hero.  
But Klein was irritated by such an abrupt and one-sided statement, and
made a demand of the spirit who chose the Hero to maintain the world and
bestowed blessings.  
  
*"Give me the power to do as I please in this world"* ― he said.  
  
The six great spirits of light, darkness, earth, water, fire, and wind,
unlike the spirits of dungeons, which are the sublimation of human
thoughts, have no interest in the human world as long as the world is
maintained, and so it gave Klein the power he desired.  
The reason the spirit chose Klein as a Hero was because of the strength
of his soul, which could cross between worlds.  
Klein was convinced that the dream he had been having since he was a
child was another world, and decided to become a Hero.  
The power of that 【Gift】 was immense, and Klein gained stats several
times higher than normal people and a body that allowed him to develop
skills quickly.  
  
In order to obtain what he―what the Klein in the "dream" was
seeking...  
  
＊＊＊  
  
《―Fool―》  
The fire dragon, which had retreated into the sky after receiving the
hero Klein's preemptive strike, returned and unleashed a fiery breath.
But―  
"―――"  
At that moment, one of the two girls behind Klein―the white-haired
girl―unleashed a wall of ice that clashed with the fiery breath.  
As if the output ignored the limits of the human body, the white-haired
girl's capillaries burst, staining her white, delicate hands with
blood.  
The next moment―  
  
Clang!!  
"............"  
《―Ngh!―》  
Suddenly, the pink-haired girl, who appeared as if leaping through
space, swung a black knife, damaging the fire dragon's horn, which had
received it in the nick of time.  
  
"Ahaha! That's right, Snow, Alia! You two are worthy of being my
comrades!"  
《―You!―》  
The fire dragon glared at the hero Klein, who was laughing wildly.  
The fire dragon frowned in irritation at the sight of the two girls
wielding unnatural powers beyond the limits of their bodies, as if
protecting the man who had cut down his comrade.  
It wasn't the kind of fire dragon to show mercy just because its
opponent was a young individual that had only recently emerged from its
larval stage. The world was a place of survival of the fittest, and it
had slaughtered everything that had challenged it as a warrior, and
eaten those who were strong.  
But―  
《―What have you done to these girls?―》  
  
The fire dragon's "dragon's eye" can capture spirits. The girls seen
with that eye were trapped in powerful dark mana, as if bound.  
It would kill enemies. But the girls' eyes were lifeless, and it was
clear that they were not attacking the fire dragon of their own
volition.  
  
The fire dragon was born on this continent and had lived for nearly a
thousand years as an attribute dragon.  
In the distant past, it simply fought as it went, and ate as its
instincts dictated. It had fought to the death with the now-vanished
iron elves, and had destroyed human settlements.  
But these thousand years had given the fire dragon "pride" as the apex
of living beings.  
It could not allow anything to defile the fire dragon's battle. It
sympathized with the girls who were interfering with it, but the
existence of an attribute dragon was not so weak as to be defeated by
attacks without will.  
《―At least I'll let you die quickly―》  
The moment it inhaled a large amount of fire mana as it waited, and was
about to exhale it―  
"Is it okay to be looking away?"  
  
Only a moment―a fleeting gap that arose in the fire dragon.  
The hero Klein, who had jumped in in an instant, raised a one-handed
sword and unleashed a slash along with a vast amount of mana.  
  
"―【Conqueror】―"  
  
―Slash!!  
***"Guaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!?"***  
  
The flash of light that was unleashed deeply cleaved the fire dragon's
thick neck.  
The sword technique 【Combat Skill】 boasted high power, but normally it
should not have the power to inflict a deep wound on an attribute
dragon. The "Hero's" status... the power of the 【Gift】 given by the
great spirit of light made it possible.  
  
"Ahaha, as I thought, it's fun to torment strong guys."  
***"Gugaa..."***  
Klein smiled as the fire dragon glared at him, having narrowly escaped
death thanks to its tough scales.  
Everything was a game for Klein, but the words he uttered were not
lies.  
Even though he agreed to become a hero in order to do as he pleased, the
Holy Church, which gave him funds and authority, did not allow it, and
only pushed troublesome things on him.  
Klein began to think of the hot-blooded and annoying Neidhardt and
Douglas as obstacles, and had been watching for an opportunity.  
However, even those two were "Hero-class," the apex of humanity. It
would not be easy to eliminate them in terms of ability or reputation.
However, with the appearance of two beautiful girls of the same
Hero-class, Klein came up with a plan to abandon his current two
comrades.  
  
If a Fire Dragon defeated a Hero-class, it couldn't be helped. Even if
there were those who were reluctant to allow the joining of young girls,
a hero's request to replace their fallen comrades could not be
refused.  
And the conditions were barely met with the sight of him cutting down
his own comrade right in front of them.  
The Hero bore the powerful blessing of "light," and could even
manipulate the power of "darkness," which is the opposite of light.  
He didn't bother to learn light or dark magic because they didn't seem
interesting, but the light he possessed constantly restored his
vitality, and the power of darkness, when reversed, could even interfere
with people's hearts.  
It couldn't be used unless their hearts were even slightly wavering, but
as living beings, it was impossible to completely control their hearts,
and by starting with the "comrade-killing" that Klein had shown, he
interfered with the girls' hearts.  
  
"My efforts will be for nothing if you get killed when things are
finally about to get exciting, right? It's a pain, so just die already.
I have to train these two from now on."  
Klein said this and raised his sword again.  
He shouldn't be able to use combat skills in succession, but it might be
possible for a hero who has regenerating vitality. The moment mana
gathered again on the one-handed sword he had raised―  
  
Thwack!  
The sound of something being struck was heard, and when he turned his
gaze to it, he saw the pink-haired girl striking her own forehead with
her fist, and the white-haired girl with blood flowing from her mouth,
both glaring at Klein at the same time.  
  
""―You have become the enemy of "us" ―""

The hero revealed his true nature, and she snapped.  
That true power is...
