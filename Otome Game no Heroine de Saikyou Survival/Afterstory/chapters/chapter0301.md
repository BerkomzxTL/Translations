## 301 Epilogue and Prologue

**Afterstory II: The Dragon Shrine Maiden**

The end and the beginning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Hero is dead.  
  
While this fact was concealed from the public, it rocked the upper
echelons of the Fandora Theocracy, where the Holy Church's main temple
was located.  
This was because the "Hero," who appears when disaster strikes the
world, is supposed to be the hope of humanity and a being who must never
be defeated.  
However, "people" feared the responsibility stemming from his death more
than they feared the evil the Hero was meant to defeat.  
  
"...Klein was dead when I arrived. I still can't believe it... The Hero,
who has the blessing of light, is supposed to be immortal! And yet...
that *Witch*!"  
  
So spoke Neidhardt, the only surviving member of the Hero's party.  
Hero Klein's corpse had its heart gouged out, but there were also traces
of unusually severe blunt force trauma, lacerations, blade wounds,
frostbite, and burns.  
Most of the wounds on the body were healing or had healed during the
battle, and because the rocks at the battlefield were scorched, the
direct cause of death remained unknown.  
  
Who killed the immortal Hero?  
  
The primary suspect in the Hero's murder was the "Witch" Neidhardt had
witnessed.  
She had jet-black hair that didn't reflect the light and deep shadows
obscuring her eyes.  
Her presence was said to overwhelm even the hero-class Neidhardt, and
she appeared to command an elemental dragon, the Fire Dragon.  
  
Eight people died during the expedition. Three missing.  
Neidhardt's late arrival was due to interference from Wyverns, flying
dragons believed to be kin of the Fire Dragon, inhabiting the rocky
mountain.  
The total number was uncertain but must've been no less than fifty. In
fact, even the Temple Knights and the rank 5 party, "Rainbow Blade,"
were highly likely to be wiped out, and it was only Neidhardt's return
as a champion-class individual that allowed them to regroup.  
However, seven casualties still occurred among the Temple Knights during
that fight. Moreover, perhaps because wild dragon species, even
sub-dragons, have a habit of taking their prey, the bodies of two
knights ended up being carried off by the flying dragons.  
  
The last casualty was reportedly an adventurer recruited from another
country.  
Her name was Snow, a white-haired young female mage.  
She was a good-looking girl whom Klein had taken a liking to and brought
along to subdue the Fire Dragon, but no one had witnessed her death. The
Holy Church's upper echelons had doubts that the "Witch" who killed the
Hero was this girl. However, one of the survivors... Alia, continued to
remain silent.  
  
What happened to Snow? Did she die? Or was she alive?  
If she was burned by the dragon's flames, strong enough to scorch and
melt the rock face, it was possible that no corpse would remain. If the
flying dragons carried off the corpses, perhaps the Fire Dragon did the
same.  
Some sympathized, believing it was understandable for Alia to remain
silent if one of her comrades met such a fate, but given the absence of
a body, Snow's connection to the "Witch" continued to be suspected.  
However, the one who denied this was none other than Neidhardt himself,
the only one who had fought the "Witch."  
  
"A mere human could never kill the Hero! That is none other than the
enemy we fight... the Evil the Hero should fight!"  
  
The Hero is chosen in times of global crisis. And Klein had received an
oracle from the Spirit of Light and came to the Sars Continent.  
In that case, would the supposed enemy the hero fought be anything other
than that black-haired "Witch"?  
Having fought her face-to-face, Neidhardt could not believe that "Witch"
was human. The faint miasma he felt from just being near her... Not to
mention, the only person to command an elemental dragon before was the
true Saintess who commanded the Holy Dragon of Light in the distant
past. Since that person was clearly not a Saintess, Neidhardt's view was
that she was an evil, inhuman being.  
Was her true identity a demon or an undead...?  
  
"...There's no way he could lose to a mere human."  
  
Neidhardt and Klein were not on particularly friendly terms; Klein was a
man Neidhardt couldn't like as a person, but he believed in his strength
above all else.  
Neidhardt, who grew up hearing stories of the Hero from the Holy Church
since childhood, fought alongside Klein not as his comrade but as a
devotee of the "Hero."  
It was unthinkable that the "Hero" could be defeated by a mere human.  
Therefore, that "Witch" could not be human.  
Neidhardt still harbored the belief that if it were him who had followed
the Hero instead of Douglas, he would not have let Klein die so easily.
It was a battle they should never have lost if they were at full
strength.  
There must be a reason why the invincible Hero died. He was determined
to expose the true identity of that "Witch" and to investigate the cause
to avenge Klein.  
  
If he does, then surely—  
  
"L-Lord Neidhardt, where are you going?"  
Cardinal Crawford, one of the inquisitors, hurriedly called out to
Neidhardt, who had left his seat partway through the proceedings.  
"This interrogation is a waste of time. Don't let that pink-haired woman
out. Annoying as it is, 'champion-class' strength is needed to fight the
'Witch'."  
"If it was going to be like this, I should have brought those two
along," Neidhardt muttered to himself. The ship from the continent
carried several Temple Knights and two other forces. But those two had
issues, and the Temple Knights were waiting in the city instead of the
temple in order to keep watch over them.  
"Y-Yes, understood, Lord Neidhardt."  
Cardinal Crawford deferentially replied to the brusque manner. Neidhardt
didn't bother to hide his contempt for the cardinal's small-minded
behavior as he stepped outside.  
Instead of going to his comrades waiting in the city, Neidhardt headed
directly to the facility dedicated to severe injuries, which housed the
wounded from the recent expedition.  
  
"Lady Alia... a room has been prepared for you. This way."  
"Understood."  
As the interrogation ended, a Temple Knight apologetically called out to
her.  
The Temple Knight's demeanor towards the champion-class Alia was polite,
but Alia was being treated as a person of interest in the Hero's murder,
and still one of the suspects.  
If left to Crawford, Alia would have been put in a prisoner's cell. But
they couldn't put a champion-class individual like her in such a place.
This Temple Knight had accompanied the Hero's party and "Rainbow Blade,"
and he himself had heard about Alia from Temple Knight Vincent, who was
also being interrogated.  
Alia's current predicament was likely due to the Holy Church's upper
echelons not having a unified opinion.  
More precisely, Cardinal Crawford, one of the cardinals who had allowed
Klein to do as he pleased in an attempt to become close to the Hero, was
looking for someone to push the responsibility for the Hero's death
onto.  
  
"Damn it."  
Unable to proceed with the inquiry freely in front of Neidhardt,
Crawford glared at Alia out of the corner of his eye and left the room,
his footsteps sounding like he was kicking the floor.  
In the Fandora Theocracy, High Priests are given noble titles. The
reason Crawford, who did not seem particularly virtuous, became a
cardinal was probably because he was originally a high-ranking noble.  
Crawford, who had gained his position through political power, feared
being blamed for his failure by his political rivals, the other
cardinals, and being forced to take responsibility. Furthermore, if he
were deemed responsible by the Holy Church's general headquarters on the
other continent, he might not even remain a cleric. His noble status
would likely become shaky, too.  
"Something... something, I have to do something."  
  
The room assigned to Alia was not one for nobility, but a guest room,
like the one she first stayed in when she first arrived.  
Since it was originally a religious facility, the design was simple, but
for Alia, it didn't matter where it was. She could go for several days
without food. She could endure even the freezing cold as long as she
could use her advanced physical enhancement.  
Even if this were an underground dungeon, Alia could escape as long as
she wasn't rendered unconscious. Her weapons had been confiscated, but
she still had several weapons hidden in her 【Shadow Storage】.  
Despite this, Alia was complying for the sake of her two "friends."  
  
Elena, who was currently working hard as the next Queen of the Claydale
Kingdom.  
Alia had intended to divert the cause of the Hero's death away from the
Claydale Kingdom by dying herself, but she unexpectedly survived and
could no longer die.  
If Alia were to die here, Cardinal Crawford, who was looking for a
scapegoat, would gleefully pin the crime on Alia and demand
responsibility from the Claydale Kingdom.  
But there was no time to lose. If Alia stood by and did nothing here,
Elena would surely abandon everything to save Alia to uphold their
promise.  
But the current Elena was no longer just a princess. If she caused
trouble and had to resign as Crown Princess, the national power and
credibility of the Claydale Kingdom would decline.  
Alia thought that if she were to die, it would be then. That would give
her a reason to die, for the sake of her country.  
However, having been saved, Alia had no intention of dying easily. But
she needed to resolve this situation before that happened.  
She needed to prove that Klein was not a person worthy of being the
"Hero." But something was missing for that.  
  
"...Is this also *her* intention?"  
Making it so Alia couldn't die was one of Snow's plans.  
Taking all the blame and saving Alia. Making herself out to be dead and
substituting the "Black-Haired Witch" to avert responsibility for the
Claydale Kingdom was merely an added bonus. Alia couldn't let her
intentions be in vain by causing trouble here.  
She wanted to save her. But if Snow, whose body should have vanished,
reappeared here, their relationship would be suspected. If that
happened, even the fact that Alia had harbored the black-haired "Thorn
Witch" could come back as a problem.  
Snow wouldn't want that. With that being the case, she would choose the
easiest solution, just as Alia, who was prepared to die, would.  
That would be to be struck down and killed by Neidhardt, one of the
members of the Hero's party who was left alive.  
  
"I won't let that happen..."  
Alia whispered softly in the empty room. Even Nero, who was in Alia's
shadow, had not yet recovered, perhaps because his wounds were
particularly severe.  
To save everyone, a strong accomplice was needed. Alia intended to move
alone to find that missing piece.  
To save the friend who always acted selfishly and intended to die
selfishly.  
Alia firmly resolved not to let things go according to Snow's plan.  
  
"Be prepared, Snow... because I'm persistent."
