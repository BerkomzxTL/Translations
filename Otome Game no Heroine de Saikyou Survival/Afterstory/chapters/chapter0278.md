## 278 Bandit Extermination

"I'm coming too!"  
Just as we were about to head off to exterminate the bandits, the old
woman suddenly appeared from who-knows-where, shouting that.  
Honestly, I was genuinely surprised. Wasn't she at the inn? I seriously
don't understand how she can slip past my and Alia's detection...  
It feels like it's useless to even think about it, so let's just leave
that aside and, for now, put a damper on her enthusiasm.  
"There's nothing interesting about it, you know?"  
  
There probably isn't anyone interesting enough to kill among bandits,
anyway.  
When I said that out of kindness, the old woman furrowed her already
wrinkled brow even deeper and glared at me.  
  
"White little girl... What do you think I came all this way for?"  
""Mead?""  
"No, you idiots!!"  
When Alia and I spoke in unison, the old woman inexplicably denied it,
even though she was the one who said it first.  
"But..."  
"Right?"  
"Enough, you noisy little girls! I've already drunk the mead!!"  
So she did drink it after all.  
"Listen, you little girls! The reason I'm accompanying you is for the
white little girl... for your body, of course!!"  
""Ah...""  
  
I completely forgot... her senility is just too much.  
Because magic stones of all attributes had been pressing on my heart
since childhood, I wasn't supposed to live to adulthood. To effectively
use my short lifespan, I wished for a 【Gift】 from the dungeon spirit
to "borrow high-level magic that I should have reached and been able to
use by the time I became an adult."  
Because of that, my lifespan was further reduced, and even if I had won
against Alia in that battle, I should have died on top of her corpse.  
That was my wish. That was my only hope.  
But... Alia crushed my fleeting dream and forced me to live.  
So, for Alia, I decided to use this life for her.  
But Alia was greedy and wished for me to live even longer.  
She really is... a mean girl.  
  
"...So, what are you going to do?"  
To be honest, I didn't take her seriously. Even if she wasn't senile due
to old age, I knew there were limits to what a human mage could do.  
Even my wonderful father, who is now living in hell with my brothers,
aimed so high that he experimented with generations of research results
on his daughter's body, but eventually gave up on reaching that goal in
his own generation.  
I was diligent, but not a genius, so I didn't wish to live.  
But... if it's this "genius."  
  
"Leave it to me. I'll mess with you little girls' bodies and make you
the strongest. Heheheh."  
...Is she going to be okay?  
"Little girl, where's my mead!? Where did you put it!?"  
"Yes, yes, we'll drink it at the inn when we're done."  
Alia handled the old woman with a familiar ease, almost mimicking the
old woman's granddaughter.  
Is she really going to be okay...?  
  
＊＊＊  
  
Most bandits weren't criminals from the start.  
Most of them were originally just villagers.  
Even in the Claydale Kingdom, with its warm climate and easy living, if
the population grew too much, people would seek new lands, developing
areas inhabited by monsters and expanding human settlements.  
For such a place to become farmland and a tax-paying agricultural
village, persistent development was necessary, while fending off
monsters and wild animals.  
Adults had to balance development and farm work while repelling external
enemies, and many villages also needed the hands of young children as
laborers.  
More children meant more workers. However, even if children grew up,
there wasn't always enough farmland to match, so second and third sons
of farmers who gave up on further development often went to work in
larger villages or towns.  
But for those taught only farming and given little proper education,
leaving the village alone required "courage."  
If they had courage... or at least strong curiosity, they could have
earned daily wages as city laborers or adventurers. But those who lacked
the courage to step onto a new path continued to flee to what was easy,
and learned to take from others.  
  
The bandits who appeared in that viscounty were a little different from
ordinary bandits who lacked courage and merely hid to attack
carriages.  
These bandits had "wisdom." They changed their attack points to avoid
being discovered by guards or soldiers, divided their numbers into
groups of several people, appointed leaders, and then a higher-ranking
individual managed these small groups to ensure orders were followed.  
Such things couldn't be done by bandits who only knew rural villages.  
The one who did it was a man who was a "former villager."  
  
The man had ambition and dreams. He wished to go to the city, become a
successful adventurer, and eventually be called a hero.  
He made companions, acquired minimal equipment with daily wages from odd
jobs, defeated pests and goblins attacking villages, felt the expansion
of the world by learning to read, and then challenged a dungeon... and
failed.  
  
The man could only reach Rank 2. Just a warrior. He wore ill-fitting,
used leather armor and wielded only the cheapest club.  
One of his companions became Rank 3 and joined other adventurers to
challenge dungeons, another gave up being an adventurer, studied reading
and arithmetic, and was hired by a shop, and some learned farming wisdom
and returned to their villages.  
The man couldn't go anywhere. Unable to return to his village after
making such grand declarations, and having no particular skills, he
merely gasped in poverty.  
At that time, a former companion, still worried, came to see him. They
told him to try hard again. But the man, seeing his former companion who
had succeeded in living a proper life... stole their wallet and ran
away.  
  
The man became a "thief."  
Behind this bandit disturbance was the work of the man who had become a
thief.  
The Thieves' Guild had already set their sights on the Dandorl family's
new industry, but because the Dandorl family kept a close watch, it was
difficult to cut into the industry and gain concessions.  
However, the man, having heard of this, paid no attention to concessions
that required "knowledge" or "connections," and simply thought of taking
things directly.  
What the former villager came up with was to use bandits.  
The Thieves' Guild, which understood evil deeds and didn't kill, and
bandits, who feared exposure and killed, were incompatible. To thieves,
bandits were like unthinking animals, and they particularly disliked
being equated with them.  
But the man, not shying away from it due to his former villager mindset,
gathered young men who were simmering in the villages and sought to
profit by "using others," a skill he learned from both guilds.  
  
"You guys, today it's the "Valley"! Hurry up!"  
The man gave instructions to the bandits. They had several hideouts
prepared and had continuously evaded the guards by resting in locations
far from their attack points.  
They funneled stolen goods through the Thieves' Guild's back channels
and attacked merchants who came to purchase goods based on information
bought from the guild. As for the supplies needed to sustain the
bandits, if they bought them in nearby villages and towns disguised as
merchants, the guards wouldn't be able to trace them back to the man.  
The man's experience, having been used by superiors as an adventurer and
a thief, proved useful.  
The problem wasn't the lord's guards or soldiers, but the possibility of
high-ranking scouts tracking them in small numbers. However, renowned
adventurers of Rank 4 or 5 wouldn't likely appear for a mere bandit
disturbance.  
But...  
The man who had fled from being an adventurer didn't know that there
were renowned adventurers who would do such "unprofitable" things.  
  
"...Hm?"  
In the dark forest, even at midday... one of the bandits, who had been
moving in small squads while erasing their tracks, suddenly collapsed.  
When his squad mates, suspicious of his silent fall, approached, a cloud
of dust suddenly swirled up and a "white shadow" danced.  
"―Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"  
Only then did a scream erupt, and in an instant, several bandits spurted
blood.  
"What's happening...?"  
The man couldn't comprehend the scene before his eyes.  
From behind the man, who could only stare blankly as his bandit
subordinates died helplessly, a "woman's" voice suddenly spoke.  
  
"It's a good day to die, isn't it? Don't you think?"  
  
Turning around, a "white girl" smiled gently at the man, her hands still
covered in blood.
