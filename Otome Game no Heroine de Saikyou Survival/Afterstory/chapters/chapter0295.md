## 295 The Hero's Power

"――――――!!"  
Hero Klein, having taken a hit from Alia, leaped back with incredible
speed.  
"―!"  
Alia, who had been about to pursue, stopped her feet. Kitty-chan
positioned itself beside Alia, ready to defend, and crackled with
electricity from its antennae in a menacing display.  
I wanted to go over there too, but I kept my guard up against Klein,
glaring at him while raising my mana.  
  
Klein, who remained still with his left hand covering his face, looked
completely open. Yet, an aura of intimidation emanated from his entire
body, strong enough to make Alia halt. He slowly removed his hand, blood
trickling from his forehead, and looked at us with his brilliantly
shining eyes, *smiling*.  
  
"Alia!"  
The moment I shouted, Alia leaped away from her spot. Kitty-chan moved
in front of her to shield her, and its claws sparked intensely.  
***"GRAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"***  
Kitty-chan's claws were repelled, and it roared at the one who did it.  
  
"Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"  
Klein laughed while swinging his sword. But, no way, right? Klein was
also repelled by the sword, but it's impossible for him to be evenly
matched with the giant body of the rank 6 kitty in close combat.  
The power was equal. But if the sizes are different, the agility is
different. Klein thrust his sword toward kitty-chan's eyes with
terrifying speed, since its fur was resistant to slashing and
piercing.  
  
"Haa!"  
Alia's dagger, slipping through the gap of that strike, aimed for
Klein's wrist.  
"Haha!"  
But Klein laughed at it, and with just the power of his wrist, he
rotated the one-handed sword with momentum, and when he repelled the
dagger that Alia unleashed with all her might, Alia and kitty-chan, who
shielded each other, took distance from Klein while taking a subtle
pause.  
  
"―【Freeze】―"  
In that instant, I, who had increased my mana, unleashed rank 6 ice
magic.  
The pure white freezing air that targeted that fleeting moment that Alia
and kitty-chan created, without missing its aim, enveloped Klein's
entire body. He'd momentarily taken his eyes off me, barely out of his
field of vision.  
Freezing and shattering the target, the strongest single target ice
magic. The only creatures that can survive after receiving this are
creatures with giant bodies, or mythical beast types like kitty-chan and
the dragon species.  
Even so...  
  
"―Haha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"  
"Light" became a sword and broke through the freezing air from the
inside.  
That is... the protection of the light spirit? No, that's not it. It's
that his magic resistance is on a completely different level compared to
humans.  
Even so, it seems that he didn't come away unscathed, his hair and
clothes were frozen, and even his fingertips were starting to discolor.
But, as the "light" surrounding Klein increased in strength, the color
began to return to his frozen skin.  
"Troublesome..."  
  
Is that the protection of the light spirit that the "Hero" receives? The
【Gift】 of the dungeon spirit that I received was quite different...  
The Hero's protection is different from special abilities like mine, and
different from body enhancement battle techniques like Alia's.  
In order to borrow the power that I should definitely obtain in the
future, I had no choice but to exchange my lifespan for wishing for a
power that should not have been possible. Alia disliked that, and hates
cheating, so she chose the form of "technique," which has many
restrictions.  
The Hero's protection, in terms of impression, is similar to Alia's
"Iron Rose" in terms of physical ability enhancement. But compared to
the Iron Rose, which has many time constraints and restrictions, Klein
didn't seem to be receiving any restrictions in obtaining that power.  
  
...Really troublesome. Alia's first attack should have been fatal under
normal circumstances, but it didn’t become a significant injury, and
even the bleeding has already stopped.  
While observing Klein and considering his combat strength, Klein's
figure suddenly blurred as he turned his gaze towards me.  
"Snow!"  
At Alia's voice, I reflexively evaded without confirming the figure of
Klein who should have attacked. With my level 3 body technique and
dynamic visual acuity, I can only catch up with that thing's shadow
anyway.  
"―!"  
That's why I evaded with just my insight, but Klein's physical ability
surpassed even that.  
Klein, who raised his one-handed sword, narrowed his eyes that were
chasing me, and while making a distorted smile as if toying with his
prey, he aimed at me so that the trajectory of the sword bent at a right
angle.  
I can't evade this. But―  
  
"―【Iron Rose】―"  
  
At that moment, with light particles fluttering like wings, Alia's kick,
with her ash iron-colored hair, blew Klein away, and the sword aimed at
me passed just barely in front of me.  
It's been a while since I've seen the shadow of death.  
Even though it was always next to me in the past...  
  
"Haha! What is that! Is that your "power"!"  
Klein, who was still laughing without any damage even after receiving
the kick with the blade, wasn’t surprised even by Alia's "Iron Rose"
which he was seeing for the first time, and his eyes were gleaming.  
Alia and Klein began to clash with blades  
Alia, who could use 100% of her physical ability using the Iron Rose,
still couldn’t overpower Klein.  
  
"Haha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"  
"......!"  
Alia deflected a blow from Klein, released with such sharpness that the
sword blurred, with her dagger, creating a grand shower of sparks.  
Using that power, Alia, who intentionally lost her balance, aimed at
Klein with the blade of her toes. But that kick was easily stopped by
Klein's kneepad.  
Klein kicked Alia while she was still off balance. But Alia entangled
her own leg that was received as if she was aiming for it, and slashed
with her knife while rising up.  
But, Klein saw it with his eyes and deflected it with his one-handed
sword, and kicked Alia away, along with the entangled leg.  
"―!"  
I don't know how much power there was in just a kick, but Alia, who was
blown away by ten houses, put her hand on the ground with one hand, and
landed as if doing a somersault.  
  
It seems she managed to avoid having her leg broken, but even so, Alia,
who was kneeling and having her attacks almost completely deflected,
cancelled the "Iron Rose" and returned her hair color to normal.  
"Haha! Have you reached your limit already! Is that all your power
is!"  
Towards Alia, who had reduced her power, Klein attacked while
laughing.  
  
***"Gaaaawooowooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"***  
Kitty-chan roared as if cutting in there, and unleashed a claw 【Combat
Skill】 from Klein's side.  
Alia sensed that this fight would be prolonged, so she suppressed mana
consumption and at the same time, created a new opportunity for
attack.  
"Oops"  
But, Klein dodged even the deadly blow that gouged out the hard earth of
the rocky area after seeing it with his eyes.  
Because of those eyes, most surprise attacks are ineffective. The only
ones that were properly received were Alia's first attack and the blow
from Iron Rose. Kitty-chan was also fast, but because of its giant body,
its initial movement was slightly inferior to Alia's and Klein's.  
  
Kitty-chan, who used the Combat Skill, stiffened slightly. Not missing
that gap, Klein glared at it who had gotten in the way and pointed his
hand imbued with mana.  
  
"―【Lightning Bind】―"  
"―【Rock Blast】―!"  
  
As the rank 6 lightning magic was cast against the rank 5 earth magic
that Klein activated a moment earlier towards kitty-chan, Klein took
distance so as to escape from that electrified area.  
Surrounding the target with a cage of lightning, dealing damage every
time it acts. I thought this magic would be effective, but it didn’t
seem to go that well.  
  
"Haha! The white one uses amazing magic!"  
Klein laughed with a distorted smile, as if he had found an interesting
toy.  
Really troublesome. But, thanks to Alia and kitty-chan, I've been able
to understand the "Hero's protection" little by little.  
The light spirit's protection that Klein received is not physical
enhancement like "Iron Rose." Probably the Hero's protection is an
instantaneous enhancement of the stats themselves.  
Even if it's just for a moment, if his strength, durability, and
agility, all jump to the level of a dragon species while maintaining the
appearance and size of a human, then that threat will surpass even
attribute dragons.  
The mass of a giant body is a great weapon, but if you can gain
dragon-level power while maintaining a human form, then the destructive
power in one point will surpass even dragons.  
  
"It seems you guys need further punishment. It seems you intend to fight
me seriously, but I'll show you "despair" first!"  
When Klein said that, he tore off the pendant from his chest, and I had
the sensation that the faint haze surrounding Klein cleared up.  
Recognition obstruction...? Come to think of it, Alia wore something
like that before to deceive appraisal. Alia also frowned when she saw
it, and Klein's appraised combat power became visible in our "eyes."  
  
【Hero Klein】【Race: Human ♂】【Rank 6】  
【Magic Value: 382/454】【Health: 373/405】  
【Total Combat Power: Instant Enhancement: 9234】  
  
"Do you understand now? You made me bleed! I'll tear off your limbs and
take you home! It's okay, I'll make sure you don't die even after we get
back!"  
  
I wonder if he's thinking about something to the extent that we would
consider suicide...?  
Alia and kitty-chan's eyes narrowed glaringly at the Hero's combat power
and his words, and I got a sense within myself of returning to the old
days.  
  
Kill to kill, kill to die.  
That's right... I've been a little too laid-back, haven't I?  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hero Klein has begun to show his power.  
What is the true seriousness that Snow is showing?
