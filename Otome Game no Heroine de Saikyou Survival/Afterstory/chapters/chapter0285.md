## 285 My Hero

"Was that... the "Hero"?"  
Alia muttered, staring in the direction the man had vanished.  
It seems not just Alia, but I've also caught his eye. ...Well, fine.  
My foot stumbled slightly as I tried to walk towards Alia, and she
quickly supported me.  
"Snow... you're much better, but don't overdo it."  
"Yes... you're right."  
The magic stone that was pressing on my heart has shrunk, and there are
almost no problems with moving as a mage, but it still feels more
constricting than for a four-element mage.  
"I'll make you some medicine later."  
"...Do I have to drink it?"  
  
My body has improved considerably. Still, my body, which had been
overexerted for over ten years, was in tatters, and apparently, I should
have been resting for years while taking medication.  
Well, I suppose Alia realized I couldn't possibly do that, and as a
result, I'm being made to drink that incredibly bitter and smelly
medicine. ...I wonder how much my body can be healed with Grandma's
health remedies.  
...If it were my old self, I could push myself because I was operating
on the premise of dying, but now I can't push myself that far.  
The pain of death is just suffering, but the suffering of life is
painful, which is troublesome.  
If it were me back then...  
I might have even been able to kill that Hero.  
  
"â€•Hey, Alia! Snow!"  
"Are you alright!?"  
At that moment, I heard those voices and saw Jesha and Feld, the two
warriors, dismount from the carriage and rush over, carrying their
unsheathed weapons.  
It wasn't just Alia who came out when the fighting intensified... though
the older members were on standby.  
"For now, let's go back."  
"Yes, you're right..."  
  
As I rested in the carriage, sipping tea with Jesha accompanying me,
Alia and Feld, who had been investigating the battle site, returned a
little later. Dalton, who had been standing with his arms crossed and a
furrow in his brow, spoke.  
"You two, tell me what you saw."  
His voice, low and commanding as the leader of "Rainbow Blade." Should I
speak first, I wonder?  
"Someone was being attacked. Assassins, probably."  
I conveyed that since they all had identical equipment but had erased
any distinguishing features, I felt they were an assassination squad
belonging to a noble or a wealthy individual, rather than the assassin's
guild.  
"Yeah. Assassin's Guild members are basically selfish, so I don't think
they'd wear the same gear."  
"If it's a noble's assassination squad, that characteristic isn't
strange. There's a possibility they usually change their faces, so since
they're dead, we couldn't find out anything."  
Alia, who had checked the battle site, confirmed it from the perspective
of a former Assassin's Guild member. Feld affirmed it from the
perspective of a former noble.  
That Hero might have wanted to keep some of them alive and bring them
back, but if they're dead, it can't be helped.  
  
"That man said he lured out the assassins."  
"A high-ranking individual attacked by a noble's private force... and
although it turned into a fight by chance, given that he called us
'champion-class,' Snow and I believe that person is the 'Hero.'"  
"And he was stronger than us, too."  
As I continued Alia's words while sipping tea, the carriage fell silent
for a moment, as if frozen.  
"No way..."  
I understand Jesha's feelings. After all, the Royal Capital was
half-destroyed by Alia and my fight.  
In terms of skill, he was almost equal to my Rank 6. And since he was
also equal to Alia with a sword, his skill level is at least Level 6 in
magic and Level 5 in close combat.  
And that's just the minimum level, too.  
  
"Snow, could you see that *things* combat power?"  
"...No. I couldn't see it either."  
Not "person" or "man," but already completely treated as "that thing."  
I didn't have time to appraise him thoroughly, but at my and Alia's
level, we should be able to make a rough appraisal by feeling his
movements and mana, yet I couldn't see it.  
If that was the Hero, was he blessed by spirits? Is that why I couldn't
tell?  
No, that's not it.  
Perhaps the nature of his strength is "beyond our expectations."  
He might have a special power like Alia's "Iron Rose" or my "Soul
Thorns."  
...How do we kill that thing?  
Perhaps thinking the same thing at the same time, Alia's and my gazes
turned towards each other.  
  
"Alia, do you know any poisons that would work on that?"  
"If the legends are true and the Hero has the blessing of spirits,
ordinary poisons won't work."  
"Poison immunity, not just resistance? Is that even possible?"  
"Poisons act physically by being absorbed into the body. Pink-haired
women from Melrose are less susceptible to illness due to the spirits'
blessing. But that's not nullifying the poison of illness; it simply
makes their bodies able to withstand small poisons."  
"So, we just need to use a stronger poison, then."  
"I think corrosive poison would work, but if it's enough to kill him,
the person who spreads it will die."  
"Then acid would be easier. But if we can break through his defenses, I
think injecting poison directly would be faster."  
"Then we could ask Galvus to make special arrows. But..."  
"You're right. In that case, Alia cutting him directly would be more
certain."  
"If we want certainty, should we aim for weakening him?"  
"In that case, we'd eliminate the people around him one by one, isolate
him, and then..."  
  
"Hold on, hold on, you two! Why are we talking about killing the Hero?!
This situation has faults on our side too, and if we attack without
clear hostility, we'll become enemies with the Holy Church!"  
""Oh...""  
We were so engrossed in planning to eliminate the Hero that Dalton's
retort brought us back to reality.  
That's true. Although it turned into a fight, the opponent isn't an
outlaw; he's the esteemed Hero-sama. I was having too much fun planning
an assassination and forgot.  
By the way, the others seemed dumbfounded when the two youngest girls
were gleefully planning an assassination.  
  
For now, whether the Hero truly becomes an enemy or if things can be
settled peacefully has been put on hold until we reach the Holy Church's
main temple.  
The problem then becomes the "Hero's" position within the Holy Church.  
The Hero was attacked. He has clear enemies with a certain status.
Moreover, he was trying to lure them out and annihilate them. This means
he has been targeted several times before.  
  
From an outsider's perspective, it forms a storybook picture of good
versus evil, with powerful figures threatened by the Hero's fame, but
there's no clear good and evil in politics.  
There's only one's own ideology and biased justice. I'm not saying
that's bad, and some people are saved by it, but others resent it.  
Whether his ideology clashes with the Holy Church's ideology, which
seeks only the happiness of the human race, or if one of them has a
fatal flaw... that will be something to look forward to upon our
reunion, I suppose.  
But...  
*(...I don't like it.)*  
  
I don't like the way that man looked at Alia.  
I don't like that man's smile, as if he was looking down on Alia.  
For me, the "Hero" and "champion" are... only Alia.
