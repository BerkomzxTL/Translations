## 281 The Nature of a Hero

"A Hero..."  
A Hero, a courageous person. They're often confused with "champions,"
but their fundamentals are different.  
A champion isn't called that from the start; they become a champion as a
result of continuous fighting, and that being recognized by people.  
But a "Hero" is different. They don't need to kill enemies. They can be
weak themselves. They are simply people who stand at the forefront,
giving courage to those who follow.  
However, the definition of that word changed at a certain point in
time.  
  
"The Holy Church, then."  
"Yes, exactly."  
At my murmur, Alia and Dalton looked back, and the princess quietly
affirmed.  
"You said it was a request from the Holy Church, but why the Holy
Church?"  
Alia then asked the princess, and she, pressing her brow as if she had a
headache, whether it was about the Hero or the Holy Church, explained.  
"First, as a premise, it is said that the existence began to be called a
"Hero" because the Holy Church so decreed it."  
  
Historically, whenever events that threatened humanity occurred, there
was an existence that prevented them and repelled them.  
An existence that saved the world unbeknownst to people... It is said
that people worshipped it as a messenger of God.  
That "existence," whose identity was unknown, became known to the world
because the "Demon Lord" appeared.  
Although its existence has not been confirmed on this Sars Continent,
historically in this world, there were supernatural beings called "Demon
Lords."  
For example, high-ranking demons surpassing greater demons.  
For example, high-ranking undead created by mages performing rituals
themselves.  
For example, dark evil dragons holding grudges against humans...  
People called these natural disaster-level beings, which transcended
even national frameworks, "Demon Lords," and it is said that Demon
Lords, with their power, commanded many monsters and destroyed numerous
countries.  
  
In that despair, a young man defeated a giant monster that was
tormenting the people, giving them a ray of hope and "courage."  
Powerful champions gathered as if guided by the young man's courage, and
the young man, along with his comrades, finally defeated the Demon
Lord.  
A Hero is an existence that gives hope and courage to people.  
However, when the Holy Church designated them as "Heroes" instead of
"champions," the nature of a "Hero" changed.  
  
"At that time, in the face of a world crisis, a young man who gained the
power of spirits defeated the Demon Lord. What should have been an
existence that gave courage to people, became an existence empowered by
spirits, called a 'Hero' by the Holy Church."  
"Is that... a "Gift"?"  
When Alia voiced her question, the princess, having finished speaking,
shook her head slightly.  
"I don't know the details either, but I've heard it's different from a
dungeon's 【Gift】. When this world faces a crisis, if one is chosen by
a spirit..."  
  
One day, suddenly, one is granted power by a spirit with power equal to
a god, and becomes a Hero.  
Was it the Holy Church's intention to define them as Heroes, and by
supporting Heroes even now, they become affiliated with the Holy Church,
and the Holy Church gathers believers and donations through their
achievements and fame?  
...That's ridiculous. Both the Hero and the Holy Church are pretty much
the same. I'm not surprised that the Holy Church has been doing such
things since ancient times, but the Hero's existence itself seems like
cheating.  
  
"In that case, for that Hero to have come all the way to this continent,
does it mean a calamity equivalent to a world crisis has appeared?"  
"That would be the case."  
"Hmm..."  
As Alia realized that fact and spoke, the princess and Dalton looked
up.  
"Why are they looking at me, then?"  
  
What rude people. All I did was try to kill tens of thousands of people
in the Royal Capital as collateral damage, at most. I'm hardly a Demon
Lord.  
  
"Putting that aside,"  
The princess cleared her throat with a small "ahem" and looked at Alia
again.  
"Alia... Do you understand why the Hero seeks you as a comrade?"  
"...The spirit's blessing."  
  
Not just anyone can be a Hero's comrade.  
Just as the Holy Church designated those granted a spirit's blessing in
times of world crisis as "Heroes," only "champions" who were comrades of
the first designated Hero are recognized as Hero's comrades.  
Honestly, I think it's absurd. If a Hero truly has power, they shouldn't
create a "comrade" framework, but rather assign thousands or tens of
thousands of people to assist them.  
However, for those who care about appearances, it probably doesn't work
that way.  
  
Even I only know from literature and forbidden books, but the "Demon
Lord" certainly existed.  
Their strength... was at least Rank 8.  
To face a threat of that level, ordinary soldiers or knights, even if
they could chip away at it, couldn't deliver the finishing blow. Even
that chipping away would only inflict a scratch at the cost of one
soldier's life.  
Sacrifice thousands to chip away at the Demon Lord's health, create an
opening, and deliver the finishing blow with the conserved power of the
Hero.  
But unless it's a "true Demon Lord" that destroys multiple nations, the
victims' families and believers probably wouldn't be satisfied.  
That's why the Hero's comrades are limited to "champion-class."  
  
"The Hero... it seems the Holy Church recognizes Alia, who received the
spirit's blessing and saved the nation, as 'champion-class.'"  
  
As the princess said, the current Alia fits the "champion-class"
framework defined by the Holy Church.  
Originally, a general of an army, someone praised for their
achievements, or a person who performed deeds worthy of being called a
Hero should be called a "champion," but this too was distorted by the
Holy Church.  
Now, those recognized by the nation for their achievements within the
"champion-class" defined by the Holy Church are called champions.  
  
Champion-class refers to those who have received a spirit's blessing or
favor and gained combat-related abilities.  
Even if they received a dungeon's blessing or favor, the princess, who
healed her body by erasing one magic attribute, and the Dandorl young
lady, who foresees the future, are outside this scope.  
I had a good laugh at the temple boy who was forced to make a contract
with a demon due to a spirit's mischief, and the fallen royalty who
ended up raising insects all over their body, but they were out of the
question from the start since they couldn't control themselves.  
...Ah, I see.  
That's why the princess told me to come too.  
  
When I looked at the princess, suddenly realizing that possibility, she
returned my gaze with a firm resolve befitting a queen, even as she
harbored human guilt.  
She's confident that even if Alia doesn't notice, I will.  
  
Among those known to have received combat-related blessings, there are
only two: Alia and "me."  
I'm supposed to be dead, but if it's known that I'm alive, who knows how
things will turn out.  
I don't know if the Hero truly possesses the power of legends.  
However, if the Hero's demands are incompatible with the nation's, and
above all, with "Alia's" wishes, in the worst-case scenario, she hopes I
will "deal with" the Hero, even if it costs me my life.  
At least, the princess's eyes looking at me said as much.  
"Hehe..."  
Alia looked at me suspiciously as I let out a faint, knowing laugh.  
Very well, Princess... no, Elena. That's what I wish for too.  
I like the eyes of a person who has made up their mind.  
Just as you and I wish, I'll *take care of* the Hero for you, without
Alia knowing.

They're really not the Demon Lord, are they!?  
  
Next time, departure... I wonder if we'll get that far?
