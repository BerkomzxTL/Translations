## 275 The Journey

"Samantha... she's the "Sandstorm Witch," right?"  
Having prepared our equipment, we followed Dalton's instructions and
went to meet the former mage. She's supposed to teach us about a mage's
role as an adventurer and their duties in "Rainbow Blade," but...  
"What kind of person is she?"  
A legendary adventurer, Samantha Samantha, who was active for a hundred
years despite being human. Well, from the fact that she uses her own
name as a surname and makes her family use it, I think she's quite...
*something*, but when I asked Alia, she tilted her head, which was
unusual for her.  
"...'Senile'?"  
"...What do you mean?"  
***"Gaa..."***  
At my murmur, which made me stop and ask again, the black cat phantom on
Alia's shoulder also chimed in. I wonder if kitty-chan has met her
too?  
If she's elderly, that might be the case, but Alia's way of saying it
sounds like a different nuance.  
"Well, you'll know when you meet her."  
  
Samantha is apparently in the Margravate of Dans. It's about a two-week
journey by carriage from the royal capital, but we're heading there on
foot.  
On foot, yes, on foot. Walking on our own two legs. There are many
inhabited areas until the Margravate of Dans, so we can't travel by
riding kitty-chan.  
I could have used spatial transfer when I could freely use my gifts, but
I don't intend to raise my Dark Magic and Light Magic levels any
further.  
If I were to raise them, it would be much nicer to spend that time on
the study and research of Ice Magic and Lightning Magic, and besides,
"Light" and "Dark" are... more suited to Alia.  
  
"But couldn't we hire a carriage, even if not a shared one?"  
We have money, after all. Not mine, but still.  
"Snow should walk to build up her stamina."  
"Since that's true, I can't say anything."  
Oh well. I don't particularly dislike walking.  
But could you please stop preparing so much food that I can't finish it
at every meal? I can tolerate the unique seasoning made with strange
herbs, but my stomach, which has only eaten what was necessary to live
until now, isn't that big, you know?  
"You're right. In that case, I'll try changing the ingredients."  
"If possible, I'd like you to change the cooking method."  
  
We travel, camping along the forest-lined road. In such a journey, I
think the enjoyment comes from the meals, but from the next meal, Alia
prepared food that was so unrecognizable, I couldn't even tell if it was
food, let alone what ingredients were in it.  
"...What is this?"  
"Bee larvae with cheese and honey."  
It seems nutritious...  
Alia hunted it in the forest... not "gathered," but she apparently
killed all the large bees that could kill a person with just a few
stings using her knife, and brought back the bee larvae from their nest
and the milky-white liquid that raises the queen bee, all in one go.  
After boiling them with Alia's special herbs, she mixed them with
cheese, served them in a bowl, and then poured plenty of honey over
them.  
Is this cooking? Isn't it alchemy? The ingredients are too strong for
medicine, and the visual impact is too intense to eat as a snack, don't
you think?  
Well, I'll eat it, but...  
  
"I've told Dalton, but I'll share the information with Snow too."  
After somehow finishing the meal and having some herbal tea, Alia, who
was on the opposite side of the bonfire, started saying that while
stroking the phantom little cat on her lap.  
"Talk about work?"  
"No, it's just a rumor I heard from Elena, but I want to hear Snow's
opinion too."  
A mere rumor. If it's a story that the pragmatic princess told Alia
because of her dreamy brother, and Alia also shared it with Dalton, then
it's not just a rumor.  
"It's about the "Hero.""  
  
Hero... a courageous one. One who appears when despair visits people and
gives them courage.  
A fairy tale that even children in this country know.  
Most of them were stories where people were attacked by evil sorcerers
or the Demon King, and the Hero and Saintess defeated them, and everyone
lived happily ever after.  
However, the "Saintess" who appeared in this country was just... *that*
kind of woman, and the being called the "Demon King" was actually just
the king of a demon race country, and while the demon race itself was an
enemy of humans, he alone didn't have the power to destroy a nation.  
But Heroes and Saintesses aren't just legends.  
It wasn't a forbidden book of the Leicester family, but it was recorded
in a forbidden book I found in the Holy Church's temple. Of course, I
read it without permission, but I'm glad I managed to take it out before
burning the temple down.  
  
"You're not going to say a Hero has appeared, are you?"  
"It seems that "unlikely" is exactly what happened."  
"...You're joking, right?"  
  
According to the rumor the princess told Alia, several months ago, that
"Hero" arrived by ship in the Melrune National Federation in the
northern part of the continent.  
"I see, in that case, the unpleasant part is that its credibility rises
a bit."  
"Considering history, that's true."  
Originally, we white-skinned Mercenians didn't live on this Saarth
Continent; it's said that we arrived by ship from another continent to
the north, along with the Holy Church.  
The Melrune National Federation is a confederation of seven small
countries, and they never truly united because each claimed to be the
first Mercenian nation established upon arriving on this continent. But
later, larger nations began to gain power, and the Melrune National
Federation is a country that reluctantly formed a confederation to
oppose them.  
The fact that they arrived there means the Hero came from that other
continent.  
Since the Melrune National Federation originally continued trade with
that continent, they might have come on a merchant ship.  
  
And the Holy Church's forbidden book recorded this:  
When evil appears in the world, the Hero is chosen by the spirits to
save the world.  
When humanity faces a crisis, the Saintess is loved by the spirits and
saves the people.  
These are not legends or fairy tales, but facts recorded in the history
of the Holy Church.  
Since both involve a crisis, when a Hero appears, a Saintess is often
chosen as well, and in fairy tales, they are often depicted together.  
Why then, did it become a "forbidden book" and kept from the public
eye?  
It lies in the existence of the "enemies" the Hero fought.  
These were "Demon Lord-class" beings incomparable to demon kings, such
as legendary evil dragons or higher-ranking demons than even high-level
demons. To counter them, the "Hero" was chosen by the spirits.  
The Holy Church is hiding the fact that such threats to humanity existed
in the past. If a threat truly appeared, perhaps they spread the fairy
tales of Saintesses and Heroes to dispel the public's anxiety, with the
Holy Church at the center.  
  
"But currently, I don't think there's any "evil" on this continent that
would warrant a Hero appearing?"  
If there really was such an evil that could destroy nations, I think
signs would have already appeared. At the very least, if a Hero felt it
on this continent and crossed over, at least a year should have passed,
so wouldn't it have been caught by the shadow intelligence network?  
At my analysis, Alia narrowed her eyes for a moment as if exasperated,
and for some reason, stared at me.  
"...You're right."  
***"Gaa..."***  
"What are you trying to say?"  
  
In the end, the matter of the Hero was put on hold... or rather, since
it's unclear what they came for, I could only say that speculating
wouldn't yield answers. Besides, unless it involves the Kingdom of
Claydale, the princess can't move, and neither will Alia.  
Well, it would be great if they just defeated something on their own and
went home on their own. I'm not interested either.  
  
"More importantly... that's in the way."  
***"Gaa"***  
"Well, has the little cat completely become a "cat" now?"  
I couldn't help but give a deadpan look at kitty-chan, who was basically
staying in Alia's shadow, yawning on Alia's lap as a phantom.  
Behind me, the bandits who had underestimated and attacked the two young
women were frozen solid, still holding their weapons.  
If it were fire, I could have made them disappear without a trace, but
with lightning, the corpses aren't clean, so I had no choice but to
freeze them.  
"Right?"  
"Clean it up."  
Can't be helped... I used an application of 【Shadow Walker】 to sink
the ice statues into the shadows of the forest and discarded them
somewhere out of sight.  
  
And so, we continued our monotonous journey, arriving at the Margravate
of Dans two weeks later. ...That said, where does the crucial Samantha
live?  
"I heard she lives in a suburban mansion in the Margravate of Dans's
capital. A letter should have been sent in advance, so..."  
Just as Alia was about to say that, we saw something approaching from
beyond the road, where a town was visible in the distance, kicking up a
cloud of sand.  
...Is it a monster?  
"―【Ice Lance】―"  
I attacked without even checking, for now. Alia didn't stop me either.  
However, the few 【Ice Lances】 I fired were intercepted by an equal
number of 【Ice Lances】 launched from the sandstorm, and taking
advantage of that opening, it leaped over us, revealing the figure of a
small old woman from the sandstorm behind us.  
  
"Well met, you young whippersnappers! I am Samantha Samantha!! Who are
you!?"  
  
I see... she's "senile," then.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for waiting, here's Samantha.  
With Snow and the others capable of clearing dungeons as a trio, there's
not much tension in their journey, is there?
