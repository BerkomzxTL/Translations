## 279 The Secret to Longevity?

"Y-you!?"  
The thief man was confused by the "white girl" who suddenly appeared
before him.  
Did this woman kill his bandit subordinates? What was the meaning of
this act?  
The girl had pure white hair, but she still looked only like a young
woman who had just come of age. Her clothes were of high quality, and at
first glance, she would have looked like a young lady from a good
family.  
Such a slender little girl couldn't possibly kill people.  
However, the red blood splattered as if to defile her white hair and
white skin, and her delicate, fish-white hands being covered in blood,
betrayed the man's thoughts.  
More than that...  
  
The blood-soaked girl, smiling as if it were an everyday occurrence,
made it clear that she was fundamentally different from them.  
  
Whoosh―  
"Hmph."  
Perhaps due to his fear, the moment the man flinched at a faint
presence, something whizzed past his face, and he felt something wet on
his cheek.  
"...Missed."  
The man, realizing from the girl's words and the blood smeared on his
cheek, which he hadn't even touched, that it had been the girl's attack,
stumbled backward to create distance.  
"Y-you guys! Enemy! Kill her!!"  
  
When the thief man, who finally recognized her as an "enemy" at this
point, started making a fuss, the bandits, who hadn't even understood
the situation after their comrades' sudden deaths, finally realized that
this white girl had killed their comrades, and began to move with
furious expressions.  
Without knowing "who" that girl was.  
Without knowing what kind of result that action would bring...  
  
"Well then, shall we begin?"  
Amidst it all, only the white girl smiled as if admiring a flower.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
Perhaps because I'm still not used to it, I missed with my hand-blade.  
Since they're going to accommodate my whims, I thought I'd at least let
them die in one blow... It seems that even when I try to be kind, it
doesn't work out well.  
Oh well...  
They couldn't even understand how their comrades died because I killed
them too easily, and since they're so motivated, I might as well make
good use of them.  
  
"Womaaaan!"  
One man lunged at me without even readying a weapon. Ugh, what a vulgar
face...  
They really don't understand, do they?  
"―Kahyuk"  
As I slightly retreated and slashed his throat with a hand-blade as if
caressing it, the man slid past me and collapsed headfirst onto the
forest floor.  
  
"Hey, what are you doing!?"  
"I'll do it!"  
The men, still not understanding, complained about their fallen comrade.
I gracefully dodged the men who attacked one after another with enhanced
body and accelerated thought, tearing their throats, breaking their
necks, and reaping their lives at a speed invisible to their eyes.  
"W-what the hell is this!?"  
I smiled sweetly at the men who finally understood that they were the
ones being hunted.  
"It's *okay*."  
  
Samantha's method of extending my life. To put it simply, her secret to
longevity, which she still practices, was in a way, quite simple.  
It was to train body enhancement, which ordinary mages don't do.  
I can use body enhancement because it's necessary for thought
acceleration. That's why I even practiced martial arts, which I'm not
good at, against monsters.  
But my 《Martial Arts Skill》 is only Level 3 at best. Even so, I can
speed up my thoughts by 30%, and that was enough to assist my magic.  
But the old woman was different. She could use Level 4 martial arts
while achieving one level higher in thought acceleration.  
What made that possible was mana control.  
It's an essential technique for efficiently using magic, reducing
consumption, and enhancing effects, but she uses it to control body
enhancement, strengthening not only her limb muscles but even her
internal organs.  
  
"W-what is this woman!?"  
"D-don't come near me!"  
I chased the fleeing bandits at twice their speed, overtook them,
circled around them, and killed them as if passing by.  
It's not like I'm killing them with just body enhancement. With my
current abilities, there's a limit to how much I can enhance myself, no
matter how much mana control I use.  
But the old woman knew the art of training it efficiently.  
It was to use practical magic.  
Practical magic uses faint mana that doesn't generate magic stones in
the heart. By handling it precisely, it becomes training for body
enhancement control, and that itself becomes a formidable "weapon."  
"Gyaaaaaaah!?"  
"H-help..."  
I wrapped myself in wind like a glove to increase my defense, created
sharp earth claws from atmospheric dust, and fine water misted my form
with light and shadow.  
But, I don't use "fire."  
Because it's a promise with Alia...  
  
Finally, to the lucky, terrified man who dodged my last blow, I offered
kind words at his end. It's okay... don't worry.  
  
"Dying isn't that scary."  
  
＊＊＊  
  
  
After exterminating the bandits, we received some reward from the
Adventurer's Guild.  
No matter that a Rank 5 wiped them all out, rewards usually don't come
immediately without confirmation from the Guild or soldiers, but the
lord apparently approved it right away after hearing Alia's name.  
In the town square, the young lord and his wife, the former prince and
princess, grandly declared that the bandit disturbance had ended, and
the residents cheered with joy.  
Hmmph...  
It seems you two are happier in that kind of position after all...  
  
"Well then, I'm going home!!"  
"...Huh?"  
Samantha's sudden declaration, after having drunk her fill of mead once
the matter was settled, made me involuntarily ask again...  
"What about the training? Aren't you going to teach me?"  
When I asked, inadvertently recalling the good-natured dark elf,
Cere’zhula, she looked at me with a puzzled expression instead.  
"White little girl!! You learn through practice! What I use is merely my
own style! From now on, you should refine it and make it your own
technique!! Now, farewell!! I'm going to play with my
great-grandchildren soon!!"  
Saying that in a loud voice as if she were across the street, the old
woman raised a cloud of dust and disappeared in an instant before I
could stop her.  
I instinctively furrowed my brow and looked at Alia, who began to pack
her belongings without a care.  
"She's satisfied after drinking her mead, isn't she?"  
"She does whatever she wants... though we're not ones to talk."  
As I sighed involuntarily, the little cat on Alia's shoulder yawned as
if exasperated.
