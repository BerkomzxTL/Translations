TN: These chapters are (much more) slipshod (than usual) but I threw something together to cover the (currently untranslated) WN chapters because I wanted to read this and didn't feel like waiting anymore. Who wants to wait 4-5 days for 1/5th of a sketchy tl of a chapter?

The epilogue is ongoing. As the afterword at the end of chapter 260 mentions, there's been a new chapter uploaded at the start of each month, 1 per month. May keep up with those for a little while.
