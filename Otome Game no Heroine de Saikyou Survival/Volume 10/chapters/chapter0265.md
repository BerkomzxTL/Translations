## 265 Daily Life in the Dungeon

"It's about time."  
After repelling the dungeon attackers, we spent a full day reaching the
fifteenth floor. The current adventurer's reach is said to be between
twenty and thirty floors... but well, this is probably the limit for
ordinary adventurers.  
"Nero."  
Feeling that there was no longer any need to worry about being seen,
Alia called out, and the little cat, summoned by her, leaped out from
her shadow.  
***"...Grrr."***  
As the little cat let out a soft growl, the presence of monsters around
us vanished.  
Even with my or Alia's intimidation, monsters of this floor wouldn't
attack, but as expected, with a Rank 6 kitty-chan around, everyone just
flees, don't they?  
―Ride―  
Kitty-chan, with Alia on its back, looked displeased... truly not hiding
its bad mood, and lowered its height slightly, pointing to its back with
its whiskers.  
"Get on."  
Alia said the same thing and offered me her hand. I took Alia's hand,
and she seated me behind her.  
Really... these two are so similar in their awkwardness.  
  
The little cat, carrying the two of us, dashed through the dimly lit
dungeon.  
When I passed through this floor before, it took half a day, but at this
speed, without any detours, it wouldn't even take half an hour.  
Just not being attacked by monsters makes things so much easier. After
riding on the little cat's back for several hours, the strain on my body
gradually increased, but... well, the pain isn't as bad as before, is
it?  
  
As expected, kitty-chan was fast, and we reached the twentieth floor in
less than half a day.  
I had anticipated it, but we didn't encounter any other adventurers.  
"It's better to go down a bit further."  
"Yes, you're right."  
If we're going to show off my and kitty-chan's power, it's definitely
better to go down to the thirtieth floor, where there are no
adventurers. However, up to the twentieth floor, the Guild had some
information, but beyond this point is uncharted territory.  
I don't know, but I'm sure this dungeon also has a hidden passage used
by the royal family. Otherwise, I don't think the former Crown Prince's
party could have cleared this dungeon in just a month or two.  
  
"We'll stop here for today."  
Alia said that, looking at my face, and dismounted from kitty-chan.  
I wasn't aware of it, but I probably had a terrible complexion. My magic
stone had become a little smaller, and my body felt lighter, but a full
day was still quite taxing.  
"Where are we?"  
"Twenty-eighth floor."  
We've come down quite a bit, haven't we? To descend this far in about
two days, isn't that a new record?  
I boiled water with a military lamp I took out from my 【Shadow
Storage】 and cooked a simple meal with ingredients I had bought before
entering the dungeon.  
It's convenient to have two 【Shadow Storage】 users. Alia's 【Shadow
Storage】 has the capacity of a wardrobe, and mine has the capacity of a
carriage. Things don't rot or get moldy inside, so I can store dried
vegetables and grains.  
  
We both ate a stew of vegetables, beans, and dried meat. The little cat
didn't eat, but this child has its own 【Shadow Storage】, so we don't
need to share with it.  
"Nero will hunt and eat on its own if it needs to."  
"Well, that's true."  
The relationship between Alia and kitty-chan is not that of a pet, a
protector, or a master. They are equals.  
  
"So that's the attribute dragon's weapon, huh?"  
Alia started cleaning her weapons, so I peered over.  
The 'black knife' and 'black dagger' she used before were broken in my
battle. They could be repaired, but their strength would decrease, and
the Rainbow Blade seems to have provided two 'Dark Dragon Fangs,' which
are party assets, for Alia.  
"Want to see?"  
"Is it alright?"  
I didn't think she'd let me hold it.  
Its impression was no different from the previous knife and dagger. But
it was surprisingly light. More than that, the mana it carried was
incredible.  
So this is the Adamantite harvested from monsters, huh...? Aside from
the Orichalcum that Alia extorted from the spirit and stabbed into me, I
think it's the best in terms of magic transmission rate and strength. Of
course, humans can't process Orichalcum.  
  
The reason it resembled the previous weapons wasn't just because the
blade shape was similar, but because the grip part was reused.  
She's not supposed to be particular about weapons... but she doesn't
waste kindness from others, does she?  
"Are the previous blade parts gone?"  
"They can't be used as is, but they're being processed so they can be
used."  
"I look forward to seeing them."  
We went to sleep as is that day. But for some reason... even though we
were in a dangerous dungeon, I felt like I had slept better than ever
before.  
  
The next day, we rode on the little cat's back again, galloping through
the dungeon.  
"Monsters... there are few of them, aren't there?"  
"Yeah."  
Not just thanks to kitty-chan, but it genuinely felt like there were
fewer monsters. The former Crown Prince's party should have passed
through much deeper floors, but why is this?  
I understand why low-rank monsters like goblins and kobolds are fleeing,
but at this depth, it wouldn't be strange to encounter Rank 3
monsters.  
It's good because it makes things easier... but well, there's no point
in thinking about it.  
However, at the end of that day... just before the fortieth floor, the
anomaly appeared in a visible form.  
  
This dungeon, like the isolated island dungeon, is a humanoid monster...
a beast-demihuman type dungeon. But the first monster we encountered in
this dungeon was a "deer."  
Probably around Rank 3? Its antlers had become blade-like, and it was
clearly gigantic. Still, it was no match for us, and we easily defeated
it with 【Ice Lance】 and the little cat's claws, but...  
"Did you find anything?"  
"As for my theory..."  
Alia, who had been examining the severed head of the monster deer, told
me.  
"The monsters are moving to lower floors."  
  
The former Crown Prince's party cleared the dungeon with the brute force
of the Second Knight Order.  
Monsters will attack endlessly if their enemies are weak. They must have
defeated many monsters with many sacrifices.  
It's unknown where dungeon monsters come from. It's said that they breed
in the dungeon, or that they are caught by the roots the dungeon
extends, but either way, they can't be replenished immediately.  
Alia theorized that since powerful monsters in the lower floors had died
out, the monsters in the middle floors descended to the lower floors to
fill that void.  
  
Then what about this deer? Even in a beast-demihuman type dungeon, there
aren't only monsters inside. The dungeon starves monsters to make them
attack people, but it doesn't want to starve them enough to make them
cannibalize each other.  
So, a small number of animals are released as food. Normally, they would
be eaten before adventurers could spot them, but due to the monsters'
movement, they survived, and those individuals became monsters due to
the dungeon's magic essence.  
The reason it attacked even with a Rank 6 kitty-chan present was
probably because it had become carnivorous.  
Even herbivores become carnivorous if they turn into monsters. This is
because monsters instinctively become stronger and start attacking
humans with high mana.  
Alia said that its sudden carnivory probably made it ferocious, and the
monster's instinct surpassed its survival instinct.  
  
The ecosystem has collapsed due to the dungeon being cleared. A new
selection process among monsters must have begun, and some individuals
are evolving. From now on, not only humanoid monsters but also
beast-type monsters will appear. Well, for now...  
"We can get meat in the dungeon too."  
"...That's right."  
As expected, Alia eats monsters too, huh?  
The deer meat, simply roasted over a fire without even being bled...
tasted nostalgically like when this group was traveling through the
forest before.
