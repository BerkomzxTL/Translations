## 298 Reason for Resolve

What I lacked... what I had forgotten, was the "resolve to die."  
But that's only one aspect of me. Why did my younger self fight with
such a resolve to die? Because I couldn't win otherwise.  
Why did I have to win? To overcome fate. I'm not a puppet controlled by
fate. I am "me." To live as "me," I had to defeat fate.  
Even if I were to die, I would die as "me."  
That was my resolve.  
And for my weak self to win, I needed to kill the enemy without the
slightest hesitation.  
What I had lost...  
It was the deadly "killing intent" to absolutely kill the enemy.  
  
I'm sorry, Snow...  
I won't let you fight alone anymore.  
I point the black dagger, made from the fangs of the Dark Dragon, at the
"enemy."  
  
"Hero Klein... you die here."  
  
＊＊＊  
  
Hero Klein, who had been fighting, suddenly felt a sense of unease.  
*(What is this... guy?)*  
The aura emanating from the pink-haired girl in front of him had
changed.  
Adventurer Alia... Alicia Melrose. According to information gathered by
the Holy Church, she was a powerful individual, considered the Crown
Princess's confidante despite being a noble lady, and was even said to
have defeated high-ranking demons.  
  
The unease wasn't about that. When he heard about her from the Holy
Church, people like Neidhardt scoffed, assuming she had defeated them
with companions, and Klein had little interest in her beyond her being a
young woman.  
However, the moment he first met her, he was convinced she was the "real
deal."  
Without exaggeration, Alia truly possessed the power to defeat demons.  
That's why he invited her to join him on the spot. He was convinced that
she was "Heroic-class," worthy of being a Hero's companion, and suitable
for him, including her appearance.  
But a woman who wouldn't listen to Klein was meaningless. What Klein
sought was a "beautiful doll" to adorn him as the Hero's companion.  
  
"HAAAAAHH!!"  
She wielded a black dagger, comparable to a magic sword, in her right
hand, and manipulated a pendulum with her left, aiming for Klein's
eyes.  
Small weapons like a pendulum couldn't pierce the Hero's "Blessing of
Light." Even that black dagger, emitting an unusual power, probably
wouldn't have the force to kill Klein in one blow.  
However, even a Hero is human, and biological instincts cause them to
instinctively protect clear vital points like the eyes, making them
follow with their gaze, and their eyelids try to close when approached
closely.  
At that moment, Alia's elbows and knees struck Klein's jaw and joints,
shaking his vision.  
  
Alia's combat power was astonishing, but that was still as a human, and
every Heroic-class individual possessed at least one "trump card."  
Even using that, Alia's combat power was only half of Klein's, and
martial arts alone couldn't inflict serious damage on Klein. But if his
stance were broken, the dagger would surely attack at that moment.  
Only Alia's black weapon could harm Klein.  
That's why Klein unconsciously became aware of it, finding himself in a
situation where he had no choice but to accept attacks of lower
threat.  
And then―  
  
"―【Ice Whip】―"  
"Tch!"  
Klein leaped back, sweeping with his magic sword, as countless thorns,
like a swarm of clinging undead, entangled him from all directions.  
  
The other "Heroic-class" individual, the snow-white woman... Snow.  
She was the first woman he saw. A Heroic-class magic user not yet in the
Hero's party, he wanted to acquire her along with Alia.  
But this woman had been hostile to Klein from the start. She had
directed killing intent at Klein so many times that Neidhardt was
irritated by it.  
  
Snow's "trump card" was probably something that converts life into
combat power. Perhaps because of that, her white hair had lost its
luster and turned black, and dark circles had appeared under her eyes.  
However, what made Snow troublesome wasn't her combat power, but how she
used her strength.  
Instead of simply unleashing grand magic repeatedly with her vast mana,
she occasionally used small spells with a wide range, fighting in a way
that eliminated escape routes.  
Moreover, perhaps because her power had increased, even when he swept it
away with his magic sword, the scattered cold air subtly numbed his
fingertips.  
Although it would heal with the "Blessing of Light," the lightning and
freezing air seemed to gradually chip away at Klein's mana and spirit,
irritating him.  
  
That brought to the surface the fundamental part of Klein's
personality... the "self" who was always dissatisfied before he was born
as Klein.  
What was merely a record, not even a past memory, for Klein, resonated
with his irritation, and he felt "dissatisfaction" towards the girls who
defied him.  
  
"...You damn bitches!"  
  
＊＊＊  
  
Alia got serious. ...No, that's a little different.  
What Alia, who had nothing just like me, was on the verge of losing. She
regained it through the existence of an "enemy" that absolutely had to
be killed.  
Unwavering resolve also needs a "core" to create it.  
On that day, when we were young, what Alia and I empathized with...  
It was "anger" towards the world.  
  
The existence of the "Hero," created by the world solely for harmony.  
What they protect is not the human world, but the world itself, and
conversely, someone who "can die for others" is not chosen as a Hero.  
  
The world is right. But it's wrong.  
At least for me...  
  
Alia's movements began to change. Unlike her previous method of
neutralizing, she shifted to a battle of wearing down.  
Close-quarters combat, where she risked her body, not allowing Klein to
deliver a killing blow.  
Klein was superior in physique, skill, strength, and speed,
everything.  
In that situation, Alia, as if leaping into Klein's swinging magic
sword, struck it with her black dagger. Though only Alia was wounded by
the scattered magical impact, she parried the attack, kicked his knee
with her heel to break his stance, and then used the black dagger as a
feint to strike his temple with her elbow.  
  
"...You damn bitches!"  
Klein roared obscenely, revealing his emotions. His entire body glowed
faintly, and his wounds healed by the blessing of the Light Spirit.  
The Hero's power, granted by spirits to fight "Demon Lord-class" enemies
like evil dragons and great demons that could destroy the world.  
Even so, it couldn't heal the spirit that Alia had chipped away.  
  
"...*Cough*."  
Blood spilled from my mouth, staining my chest. Having healed my body
enough to move, I drew mana from my soul to support Alia.  
But at that moment, just as I had done, Alia looked at me for an
instant.  
...You're expecting quite a lot, aren't you?  
Alright... I'll show you the real me that you know.  
  
You might think that if a problem arises from killing the Hero, you can
just die... but...  
I won't let you do that. Because "I" am the one who will kill the
"Hero."  
  
＊＊＊  
  
I dodged Klein's swinging magic sword, took his kick with my knee, and
was sent flying to create distance.  
At that moment, as Klein swung his magic sword within killing range, the
four pendulums I controlled with my left hand struck his joints,
slightly deflecting his attack. I dodged the shifted blow and closed the
distance again.  
"So annoying!"  
Klein forcibly swung his magic sword to create distance. For me, with
nearly double the combat power gap, even parrying was a life-or-death
gamble.  
But little by little... just a little, I was starting to adapt to it.  
Was Klein's spirit being worn down, making his techniques rougher?  
Was I starting to get used to Klein's attacks?  
All of them were probably true. But that wasn't all.  
  
*Clang*!!  
I parried a blow from the magic sword, but the force pushed me back. I
leaped back without closing the distance again, landing on my feet.  
I slowly exhaled and deactivated "Iron Rose," sheathed my black dagger
at my waist, and then, in my normal state, beckoned Klein with a finger
as if to provoke him.  
  
"You goddamn bitchhhhh!!"  
Klein, his spirit worn down and visibly enraged, unleashed mana from his
entire body and charged in, magic sword at the ready.  
I know. In this state, it's just a suicidal act. But...  
"Gah―"  
I had "conviction."  
I subtly deflected the tip of the magic sword, thrust straight at me,
with a fist imbued with a faint touch of "silver." As the magic sword
whizzed past my head, cutting off a few strands of hair, I struck
Klein's face with a palm heel.  
  
"―!?"  
Klein's face twisted more in confusion than from the impact.  
You wouldn't understand... never in your life.  
Having used Iron Rose countless times and illusion magic countless
times, I could now use the "silver" of the "Rejected World" for a brief
moment.  
Even so, due to the difference in combat power, my hand that struck with
the palm heel still tingled.  
"Dieee!!"  
Still, I deflected the magic sword, swung in anger, with a fist imbued
with a momentary "silver," then stepped on Klein's incoming kick and
kicked his face upwards.  
"Gugoh!?"  
  
It wasn't that my speed caught up. It wasn't that my power increased.  
But I could read attacks too fast for the eye by their presence. I could
see the flow of mana, predicting attacks.  
It wasn't that my stats increased.  
Within me, I felt my skills gradually improving.  
  
"You bastarddd!!"  
Klein's sword speed increased, and the wind pressure and residual mana
alone wounded my shoulder and arm, blood spilling from my cheek. But I
couldn't kill him.  
I sheathed my dagger to distract him. The attention that had been
focused on the dagger lost its target, creating a slight opening.  
I understand your techniques now, Klein.  
Your techniques lack "might." You haven't fought enough against stronger
opponents. That's why, even with a difference in combat power, I can
parry like this.  
  
Skills are carved into the soul by repeating them countless times and
imprinting them on the body.  
I have fought against stronger opponents, understood my enemies, and
carved techniques into my soul by risking my life.  
But your techniques are merely carved, lacking depth.  
That's because your techniques are "borrowed," given by spirits.

*Guh*―  
"―!"  
Finally, my palm strike broke through Klein's defense, shaking his jaw
violently. At that moment―  
"Tch!"  
Klein tried to dodge not me, but the enormous mana surging from behind
him, but his repeatedly shaken brain wouldn't allow it.  
In my vision, as I instinctively leaped back, I saw the smile of Snow,
her black hair flowing, who had been raising her mana, trusting me. Her
white fingertip gently pointed at Klein.  
  
"―【Thunder Break】―"  
  
At that moment, countless bolts of lightning pouring from the sky
converged, becoming one massive bolt that struck Klein.  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alia finally shows her power.  
Snow's blow strikes Klein.
