## 271 Young Spirit

***"GIIYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
The Chimera, ingrained to protect the altar, closed in on me with
incredible speed, and the moment its newly generated, bear-like giant
arm swung down at me―  
"...Hurry up."  
As if responding to my displeased murmur, light overflowed from the
altar, engulfing the entirety of the deepest chamber.  
  
"...Cough."  
The moment I was teleported somewhere, I coughed up blood, perhaps due
to the strain I had put myself under.  
I tried to act fine in front of her, but it seems I can't push myself
too hard with one less attribute...  
But as calculated, I managed to reach the spirit's domain. It was a
gamble, but I'm glad I made it before I died.  
As proof of reaching the domain, the blood I had just coughed up
disappeared, and my battered body and depleted mana were gradually
recovering.  
"...It seems it won't even fix my tattered clothes."  
I shed my ragged cloak and, imitating Alia, tore the ripped skirt
clinging to my legs vertically. This made it easier to move, but... my
legs are still thin.  
My complexion seems to have improved quite a bit with Alia's potent
medicine, but I'm still pale and lacking flesh, so I guess I need to eat
more?  
"Now then..."  
The entire area was a milky white world like a dense fog. While feeling
uncomfortable with the strange air that tried to calm my mind, I
squinted my eyes and noticed "power" gathering before me.  
  
The large dungeon directly controlled by the royal family, managed by
the Leicester family.  
The spirit of this dungeon is said to be relatively "human-friendly"
among the large dungeons owned by the Claydale Kingdom.  
This is due to its relatively easy capture difficulty. And like other
dungeons, it doesn't grant blessings to ordinary soldiers but to those
with strong will, but this dungeon's spirit granted gifts to more people
than other dungeon spirits.  
  
Since childhood, I had continuously delved into this dungeon.  
This was because if it was easy to capture, I might've gain a gift, and
when I researched texts about this dungeon's spirit found in the
Leicester family's forbidden books, I had doubts about the nature of
this spirit.  
I, who had grown stronger with the resolve to kill and the resolve to
die as a hope for living, also researched the mage guild's texts to
clear those doubts, delved into the dungeon several times, and arrived
at a single hypothesis.  
  
The spirit of this dungeon is not "kind."  
The spirit of this dungeon is "simple."  
  
《―Art thou the "human" who uttered insults to me―》  
  
It appeared in the space where power had gathered.  
Unlike the spirit of the isolated island dungeon or the spirit of the
demon fortress, it took the form of a "child" clad in ancient tribal
clothing.  
In a word, it was very young. Both its appearance, which couldn't be
distinguished as male or female, and its words and actions, which
summoned me here in response to my insults, all seemed "childish."  
"I apologize for that. As a fragile human, wasn't it unavoidable in such
a situation?"  
When I offered a perfunctory apology, the spirit nodded, looking down
from above.  
  
《―It is unavoidable for a frail human, then... Humans die so quickly.
That is why, in their diminutive bodies, they desire power―》  
  
The spirit said that and convinced itself.  
I can't tell if it's male or female from its way of speaking or its
voice. Or perhaps it has no gender at all.  
  
《―Then, daughter of man. It is rare for me to show myself even when
granting power. As a reward for summoning me, I shall grant thee a
"gift"―》  
  
I had investigated this dungeon's spirit and formed a hypothesis.  
The spirit here is still "young." Not in terms of age, but I
hypothesized that the majority of the residual thoughts that formed its
core were still those of a young child.  
According to old forbidden books, before the Claydale Kingdom was
unified, to counter the southern Melrose Duchy and the northern Dandorl
Duchy, the king at the time took many wives and sent many royals into
this dungeon.  
At that time, the dungeon only had seventy floors, and the spirit must
have just been born. Many young royals, filled with hope to protect this
country and ambition to annex other nations, knowing that blessings
could be granted, lost their lives here.  
As a result, the newborn spirit absorbed the thoughts of these young
royals, becoming a spirit with an appearance and mind that couldn't
fully mature, as it is now.  
...If this hypothesis is correct, then it truly was a forbidden book
that couldn't be revealed publicly.  
And now, by meeting this spirit, I confirmed that my hypothesis was
correct.  
  
Because the spirit is young, it was insulted and summoned me.  
Because the spirit is young, even the former Crown Prince and his
companions... even that fake saintess, were able to receive blessings.  
Because the spirit is young... people's wishes are conveniently
misinterpreted.  
Like the temple head's grandchild, who sought power to protect a loved
one and was made to contract with a demon.  
Like the king's younger brother, who sought a strong body to resist
power and was parasitized by an insect.  
Honestly, it's utterly useless...  
But this spirit is not evil. It's just innocent. History books show that
if a wish is pure and not tainted by greed, a corresponding blessing can
be obtained.  
That's why I...  
I don't wish.  
  
"What I desire is... a "trade.""  
  
＊＊＊  
  
"Snow!"  
Alia's voice reached me as I returned to reality.  
Good... both of them are still safe. But it seems they weren't
unharmed.  
I had wondered why Alia wasn't called by that spirit, but seeing the two
fighting to protect each other, I understood. Alia... you refused,
didn't you?  
It's not because you have no wish. Although the sense of time is
different here and there, I believe you deliberately stayed behind for
kitty-chan, who would have been left alone here.  
That's just like you... truly.  
How much time had passed since I disappeared?  
The time it takes to count to ten? Or a hundred? During that time, Alia
and the little cat had been fighting to buy me time. No, not just that.
Coming to this dungeon was also for me, who was on the verge of
death...  
  
Alia's wish was for my body to heal.  
But the "Golden Dagger" that erases attributes, like the one received in
the demon fortress dungeon, was obtained because Alia wished for it as a
reward for abandoning her own reward and as a wish for two people.  
That's why this time, I had to choose to heal my body by my own will.  
I could have simply wished for power from this dungeon's spirit to
defeat the Chimera. But that would be betraying Alia. It would make the
meaning of coming this far meaningless.  
So I guided the young spirit's thoughts and found a way to do both.  
My body won't be completely healed.  
I won't be able to perfectly defeat the Chimera.  
But that's fine, isn't it? A "fight" where you can see the end is
boring.  
  
***"GIIYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
  
The Chimera, noticing me, abandoned the two and charged towards me.  
Because its intelligence was only half-developed, it let out a roar of
anger and attacked with full force, both because I had outsmarted it and
because of its command to protect the altar.  
"...That's fine."  
New mana surged through my entire body, and two attributes gathered in
both my arms.  
  
"―【Ice Storm】―"  
  
A directional Ice Storm pushed back the charging Chimera―  
  
"―【Chase Lightning】―"  
  
Several unleashed lightning bolts accurately struck the Chimera's limbs
and heads.  
  
***"―GIGAAAAIYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
The Chimera let out a scream of pain from the "Level 5" magic, unleashed
almost simultaneously and with even greater power.  
Simultaneous activation of Level 5 magic, which was difficult for my
previous self.  
I will surpass my former "self."

What new power did Snow obtain?  
Next time, its contents will be revealed.  
And Snow will surpass herself even further.

Addendum  
If you purchase the book version from the TO Books Online Store, it
comes with a short story booklet? I write the main story of the game
every time, but this time it's the Nathaniel route. Please enjoy the
terrible contrast with the main story lol  
The comic adaptation of the short story from Volume 1 of the book was
newly drawn for the comic. It's really good and a must-see!
