## 266 Monsters

"Right."  
"―【Ice Whip】―"  
At Alia's voice, I swept with an ice whip without even checking.  
The scream of a beast echoed. Without turning my head, I scattered 【Ice
Lance】 around where the scream came from, finishing it off.  
...It's a pain not being able to burn them. Because if you don't destroy
the corpse, you can't tell if it's dead right away, and the feeling of
having killed it is also faint.  
  
We had advanced to about the sixtieth floor of the dungeon.  
What day was it today? Alia is meticulous, so I'm sure she remembers,
but I wasn't interested, so I hadn't counted. If I had been delving
alone like before, would I have counted properly...?  
But there's no meaning in such a hypothesis. Because if there's someone
nearby who remembers, there's no need for me to remember, is there? I
won't be adventuring with anyone other than Alia anyway. I'm just here
to kill Alia's enemies.  
  
But I'm getting used to fighting without fire now. If I don't know how
much power to unleash on which enemy to kill them in one blow, I'll just
waste shots.  
I think I can put out a bit more power. At the very least, I want more
power from ice and lightning than before.  
When I had all attributes, my strength was being able to fight flexibly
using all kinds of magic, but considering reducing one more attribute, I
have to fundamentally change my fighting style.  
What can I do? What can I do?  
What can I do for Alia?  
Well, for now...  
"―【Digvolt】―"  
My lightning strike traveled across the frozen stone floor, sweeping
away the surrounding enemies.  
  
"It's all beast-type, isn't it?"  
"Indeed."  
After the battle, we made small talk while watching Alia take only the
meat and magic stones from the large monsters.  
I can also butcher, but Alia is better at it, so I just watch. The
little cat doesn't even bother with butchering, so it's just eating the
meat of some suitable prey.  
"Let's eat too. Then we'll take a short nap."  
"Yes, yes."  
This is the good thing about small parties. If there's a moderately good
spot, you can rest and eat whenever you like. And since you can't even
see the sun, there's no need to sleep all at once at night.  
  
"What's for dinner today, I wonder ♪"  
"No intention of helping?"  
"Alia, you're such a challenger."  
"Today, we're using offal."  
Alia easily gave up on making me help and started preparing to cook.  
  
It's been quite a while since we delved into the dungeon, but we still
have plenty of mental and physical energy.  
We have 【Shadow Storage】, so we don't need to carry a lot of luggage
or food, water can be handled with life magic, injuries and illnesses
can be cured with light magic, and we can clean ourselves with
【Cleanse】, so we don't mind blood splatters either.  
But what's really important mentally is that we don't have to worry
about ingredients.  
This time, it was freshly hunted liver boiled in water, with dried
vegetables and beans added, seasoned with salt and a small amount of
spices.  
"It's nutritious."  
"Well, I suppose so."  
The taste... wasn't bad. It could even be classified as human food. If
Alia were serious about only focusing on nutritional value, I'd be
forced to drink some unidentifiable sludge. But...  
"Why is it sour?"  
"I put in sour fruits to prevent scurvy."  
In response to my question, Alia showed me an unfamiliar fruit that she
took out from her 【Shadow Storage】, saying it had a long shelf life.  
Alia said that if you store it in 【Shadow Storage】 for a few hours,
parasites die, and you can eat the liver raw, but I can't do that.  
Alia isn't bad at cooking, generally, so why does she insist on using
strange ingredients?  
  
Alia uses organ meats not just because she's particular about
nutritional value, but because there's too much meat.  
This is supposed to be a dungeon of humanoid beast-demihumans, but as we
go deeper, the number of humanoids decreases, and beast-type monsters
become more prominent.  
In short, normally perishable organs are all-you-can-eat. Though,
ordinary people don't eat monster meat much because its magic essence is
too strong.  
  
"...As expected, there's a change occurring in the dungeon's
ecosystem."  
Alia muttered that, as if reading my thoughts.  
"You said that before, too."  
"Yeah. I thought that humanoid monsters had temporarily decreased, and
the beasts that were their prey had become monsters, but beast-type
monsters have increased more than I expected."  
  
Beasts prepared by the dungeon for the beast-demihumans.  
I think the dungeon extends parts of itself like roots to capture them,
but since they were originally for food, many of the beast-type monsters
we encountered were deer and boars, and even the ferocious ones were
only about the level of magic wolves.  
But, setting aside the wolf types, can deer and boars defeat orcs and
ogres, even if their numbers have decreased?  
In reality, since they are being defeated, I suppose they can. With the
magic essence filling the dungeon, monsterization should be relatively
easy, but...  
  
"Most likely, powerful monsters are growing."  
Alia let out a quiet murmur.  
"And they defeated the strong beast-demihumans that remained."  
In response, I began to theorize.  
A selection process among monsters within the dungeon began, and a being
that stood out above the rest was born. But it wasn't a beast-demihuman
that had originally been in this dungeon, but a beast-type monster.  
That monster sought stronger prey and magic essence, advancing deeper
and growing stronger by devouring beast-demihumans.  
"I feel something intentional about it."  
"...The dungeon's will is doing that?"  
This time, Alia answered my murmur.  
"A new boss is necessary, isn't it? I don't know if it's the dungeon's
will or the spirit's will, but if so... a considerably powerful monster
is being born."  
  
As I spoke of serious matters in a light tone, the little cat, who had
been closing its eyes, twitched its whiskers, and Alia slowly sighed.  
The dungeon is probably giving up on beast-demihumans and trying to
change into a beast-type dungeon.  
How troublesome... There might be monsters I've never seen before.  
While I was thinking such things, Alia finished cleaning up after the
meal and lay down, wrapping herself in her cloak, as she called out to
me.  
Like a cat...  
  
"Let's go to sleep quickly. We'll move as soon as we wake up. If that
worst-case prediction is correct, there should be even fewer monsters on
the lower floors, so we'll advance as much as we can now."  
"...Understood."  
Being able to immediately find advantages even from the worst
predictions is, well, a good thing, isn't it?  
  
There are unknown enemies. I think we can defeat most enemies, but the
opponent might not be a normal enemy.  
My power has decreased since I no longer have all attributes.  
I have to find my own way of fighting before we reach the lowest
floor.  
Alia uses 【Light】 and 【Dark】 magic and has acquired the formidable
power of 【World Rejection】.  
So, what do I have?  
"............"  
I also used a spare cloak from my 【Shadow Storage】 as a pillow and
fell asleep.  
...I'm going to be tired tomorrow.  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, if you stayed in a dungeon for weeks, you wouldn't be this
relaxed.  
Assassin (Rank 5) Mage (Rank 5) Phantom Beast (Rank 6)  
As expected, life magic and storage magic are essential for survival.
