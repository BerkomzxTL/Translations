## 261 Snow White of Thorns

The main story has concluded, so this will be the start of the
afterstory.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The adventurer party, *Rainbow Blade*.  
They were one of the leading Rank 5 parties in the Claydale Kingdom, a
major power on the Sars Continent, boasting a tradition spanning over a
hundred years and the highest quest completion rate in the entire
kingdom.  
The best and the strongest. But the reputation cultivated over those
long years was now about to become a new *legend*, thanks to a certain
young girl.  
  
***"GIIIGAAARGHHHH!!"***  
A Wyvern soaring through the sky bared its fangs, roaring menacingly.  
The Rainbow Blade had received a request to investigate and exterminate
a flock of Wyverns that had appeared in the monster habitat north of the
kingdom and were approaching the kingdom's territory.  
However, the information was late, and the Wyvern flock had already
moved in search of feeding grounds. The Rainbow Blade quickly caught up
with the flock, which was heading towards the nearest town, and began
combat just before they reached it.  
  
"Don't let a single one reach the town!"  
At Dalton, their leader's, voice, the party members sprang into action.
There were six Wyverns, and only a short distance to the town.  
"―*Spirit of Wind*―"  
Mira, the spirit magic user, simultaneously cast *Wind's Protection* and
generated a *Tornado* to engulf multiple Wyverns.  
***"GIIIGYAAARGHHH!"***  
The engulfed Wyverns stalled and began to fall.  
Even if not as much as a Dragon, a Wyvern's tough scales couldn't be
torn by wind blades. However, if their vision was blocked, they would
lose their direction, and if their speed dropped, they didn't possess
wings strong enough to support their own weight.  
Still, Mira, who had used advanced magic twice, wouldn't be able to use
magic for a while. One of the falling Wyverns, filled with rage, charged
at them.  
  
"You won't get through!"  
Dalton, clad in full Mithril armor, stood before the Wyvern.  
It was a giant, five meters long. Even if its skeleton was lightened for
flight, it would still deliver an impact like taking a cannonball
head-on. But―  
"WOOOOAAAHHHH!"  
Dalton, a Rank 5 heavy warrior, withstood the blow.  
"OOORRRYYAAAHHH!!"  
From directly beside him, Jesha, also a Mountain Dwarf, slammed her
magic steel great axe into the Wyvern's neck, severing its long,
snake-like neck.  
  
***"GIIIGAAARGHHHH!!"***  
The Wyverns now fully recognized them as enemies. The two fallen Wyverns
broke their fall with their legs just before hitting the ground and
rushed forward with the speed of a running bird.  
In response, the giant swordsman-Feld-leapt forward and swung the black
greatsword from his back.  
"TAAAAHHHH!!"  
The greatsword, crafted from a Dark Dragon's horn, combined with Feld's
skill, sliced through the Wyvern's scales like splinters.  
***"GIGAAARGH!"***  
At the same time, another Wyvern swung its fangs at Feld. But at that
moment, Dalton, who had rushed over, swung his Mithril halberd, which
slipped past Feld's side and crushed the Wyvern's head from its mouth to
its brain.  
  
The Wyverns still in the sky scattered venom from the poisonous barbs on
their tails. But it was blocked by Wind's Protection.  
Unlike mythical beasts like Earth Dragons and Elemental Dragons, Wyverns
couldn't use breath attacks. With their ground attacks sealed, and the
Wyverns showing a slight hint of fear at the attack power of the humans
on the ground, at that very moment, a small figure, her black skirt
fluttering, soared above the Wyverns' heads.  
Her pinkish-gold hair shimmered in the sunlight. Her black leather dress
flapped like a monstrous bird. And above all, in the cold, murderous
eyes of the girl—Alia—the Wyverns bared their fangs in fear.  
"Hup!"  
Without flinching or fear, the girl let out a light breath as her black
dagger pierced both of the Wyvern's eyes.  
The Wyvern, having lost its sight, stalled and fell. But from behind it,
another Wyvern, filled with rage, spun its body in a circle and slammed
the poisonous barb on its tail at the girl.  
  
Whoosh!  
At that instant, an arrow fired by the recovered Mira grazed the
Wyvern's face, and as if waiting for that moment, Alia, who had leaped
out, swung the knife and dagger made from "Dark Dragon's Fangs" at the
Wyvern, which had momentarily stopped moving.  
"―【Dancing Reaper】―"  
The fangs of an Elemental Dragon were nothing to the scales of a Wyvern,
and the Wyvern, its wings and face slashed, shrieked and fell.  
  
Seeing that, the last Wyvern lost its will to fight and fled. But in
that direction was the town.  
Soldiers who had noticed them from the watchtower on the outer wall
fired arrows, but it was difficult to hit an object flying at high speed
through the sky, and even if they did hit, arrows from low-level archery
wouldn't penetrate a Wyvern's scales.  
The soldiers' faces twitched at the sight of the giant Wyvern heading
straight for them. But there... in front of the outer wall surrounding
the town, stood a single "girl."  
  
"―【Chase Lightning】―"  
  
A flash. Multiple lightning strikes unleashed by the girl pierced the
Wyvern's wings, causing it to lose its balance.  
However, even without wing propulsion, the Wyvern, propelled by inertia,
didn't stop. It seemed the town would suffer damage. At that moment, a
girl clad in white gently stepped forward.  
With the hood of her pure white robe pulled low over her eyes, and her
wavy, pure white hair swaying, the girl thrust out both hands as if to
block the Wyvern's path.  
  
"―【Ice Whip】―"  
  
Who knows how much magical power was imbued within it, but a vast amount
of icy thorns, generated from the white-clad girl, entangled the Wyvern,
instantly transforming it into an ice sculpture, and then shattered the
frozen Wyvern.  
Cheers erupted from the town's soldiers.  
In the fantastical world where ice scattered like dust, the girl in
white walked and laughed, her white hair swaying..  
  
The Rank 5 adventurer party, *Rainbow Blade*.  
Their reputation was about to change from tradition to *legend*, thanks
to two girls.  
One was the Dragon Slayer, the pink-haired girl, *Cinders*, *Iron Rose
Princess*.  
And―  
The newly joined Rank 5 mage... no one knew her real name. But from her
pure white attire and hair, people called her *Snow White*.
