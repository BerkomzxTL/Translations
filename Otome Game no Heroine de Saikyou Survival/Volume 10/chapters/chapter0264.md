## 264 Large-Scale Dungeon

The town with the dungeon managed by the new Leicester family.  
Even if the lord changes, human activities remain the same. However,
unlike my father's time, when he had no interest in governance, the
number of guards in town had increased, and the knights guarding the
dungeon entrance had gentler faces, making me feel the passage of
time.  
"Young ladies, our eyes cannot reach inside, so please don't go too
deep..."  
"Thank you. But it's alright. We're used to it."  
Is there another reason why the young knights are so kind...?  
Having provisionally registered as an adventurer, Alia and I entered the
large-scale dungeon together.  
***"...Meow."***  
Correction. The little cat was there too.  
It hadn't shown itself at the Adventurer's Guild, but the black cat
immediately jumped onto Alia's shoulder the moment we entered the
labyrinth... Well, whatever, but that "cat imitation" is quite
detailed.  
  
Even inside the labyrinth, near the entrance of the first basement
floor, a fair number of adventurers could be seen.  
The most capable adventurers would quickly descend to lower floors, so
the ones in this area must be the hopeless types.  
I felt some rather unpleasant gazes from those guys directed at us, two
women.  
  
Children with a lot of mana grow quickly. Adults with a lot of mana age
slowly.  
There are theories such as growing quickly so that the magic stones
generated in the body don't become a burden, or aging slowly because
they've become closer to elf demi-humans, but in any case, our current
appearance was about sixteen years old, one or two years older than our
actual age.  
The growth rate has decreased compared to when we were younger because
the age at which growth promotion switches to aging deceleration is said
to be around twenty for men and around seventeen for women, and we are
approaching that age. So...  
"Alia, you're beautiful."  
Enough to unnecessarily attract the gazes of men. But still, you're more
beautiful covered in blood.  
"Don't say silly things, let's decide on a capture route."  
"Yes, yes."  
***"Meow..."***  
I gave a perfunctory reply to Alia and the little cat, who were looking
at me with exasperated eyes, and chuckled, checking some of the gazes
that had disappeared without me noticing.  
Ah... whose blood will stain me this time?  
  
A large-scale dungeon that had only ever been cleared by the brute force
of noble wealth.  
I wondered how Alia, who said we, two people and one cat, would clear
it, would go about it...  
"In the end, it's just brute force, isn't it?"  
"It's not a problem for us, is it?"  
Alia replied to my complaint as if it were nothing.  
  
Adventurers can't clear it because they can't bring the necessary
supplies and combat power to reach the lowest floor.  
Nobles can only use brute force because they can only gather enough
numbers to reach the deepest part while preserving their combat power.  
But we are different. Our "conditions" are fundamentally different.  
  
We headed downwards without making any detours for now.  
Up to about the tenth floor, ordinary adventurers can reach, so there
are fewer dangers and more information. Especially since we don't need
to obtain materials or magic stones from monsters, we were able to
descend to the third floor without fighting even once, just with the
little cat's light intimidation.  
  
"Shall we rest a little?"  
"...Understood."  
When I said that about half an hour later, Alia agreed with a puzzled
look. Doesn't this girl remember that I'm recovering from an illness?  
Well, in reality, I wasn't tired enough to need a break. With my mana,
if I'm just doing body reinforcement for walking, consumption and
natural recovery almost balance out.  
If I get thirsty, I don't even need to take out my water bottle; I can
just drink directly from my hand with the life magic 【Flowing
Water】.  
Still, I wanted to rest because if we went too fast, they wouldn't be
able to catch up, would they?  
  
"...You even brought something like that?"  
"Oh, Alia. Hydration is essential, you know?"  
Alia looked exasperated when she saw the tea-making tools I took out
from my 【Shadow Storage】.  
It was a used military item sold at a street stall; I could boil water
by placing a kettle on a small oil lamp. I put tea leaves directly into
it, poured water with 【Flowing Water】, and just as I was about to
light the fire...  
"Don't use "fire.""  
Alia noticed and grabbed my wrist.  
  
I had lost my fire attribute. My magic stone had become smaller by that
much, and my physical condition was better, but... it wasn't impossible
to regain the fire attribute.  
It would be starting from scratch again, but if I trained, a magic stone
should be generated again.  
I thought there wouldn't be a problem with life magic that wasn't
attribute-related, but Alia wouldn't even allow that.  
  
"Then, would you light it for me?"  
"Understood."  
We drank tea in silence for a while. After a short time, the little cat
got bored and started to fidget, so we began to move again.  
Well... I have a hunch it's about time.  
  
A little more time passed, and as we approached the stairs to the fourth
floor, Alia suddenly turned around.  
"Were you perhaps waiting for this?"  
"Yes, of course."  
When I answered the displeased Alia with a full smile, she let out a
deep sigh.  
And as we approached the stairs...  
  
"Ladies, this path is closed."  
About ten men were waiting for us in front of the stairs.  
All of them, ranging from their mid-twenties to mid-thirties, were
warriors or scouts, and they looked at us... especially at Alia, whose
face was exposed, with lewd smiles.  
It wasn't unusual. Even if they started as adventurers with dreams and
hopes, as they aged, they would see their limits.  
When they reached their limits, those who could train multiple skills
and do various things were called "veterans," and those who couldn't
even do that became "dropouts" and learned to leech off others.  
  
They should have used that effort to become stronger... but it's
impossible, isn't it?  
Half of the men were Rank 3, but it was useless to tell anything to
those who had only about 50 mana and couldn't even appraise, let alone
feel an enemy's strength with their skin.  
  
"Would you please move?"  
Alia said quietly, without even using intimidation.  
"That's not how it works. Lately, it's been hard to earn money
outside... Just cooperate quietly, okay? You don't like pain, do you?"  
The man who seemed to be the leader said that playfully, and the other
men laughed.  
I see. So they're repeat offenders, after all. Not beginner hunters, but
they must have been attacking women or adventurers who seemed well-off
like this.  
But, too bad for them.  
To admit their crime in front of Alia...  
  
"Nero. That's enough."  
  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
At that moment, a jet-black beast leaped out from Alia's expanding
shadow, tearing several men to shreds from directly below them like
rags.  
"What?!"  
The leader turned around at the scream from directly behind him.
But...  
"Is it alright to look away?"  
In front of the leader, who flinched and turned back around, Alia, who
had instantly cut down two vanguards, was swinging her black knife.  
"Damn it!"  
Even rotten, he was Rank 3. The man, whose combat power alone exceeded
300, instinctively tried to block the attack with his gauntlet―  
"―!!"  
The leader's head, which had his hardened leather gauntlet, flesh,
bones, and the neck beyond them, all severed in one blow, flew off with
an expression of astonishment still plastered on it.  
Her skill is one thing... but that's Alia's new weapon, isn't it?  
  
"W-what is that monster?!"  
"Hyaaaah!?"  
The surviving men, whose comrades were being killed in an instant,
rushed towards me, who looked like a mage.  
Ah, good... if no one had come, it would have been a waste to lure them
all the way from the entrance.  
A smile appeared on my lips.  
Fear surfaced on the faces of the men who saw it.  
  
"―【Digvolt】―"  
The dazzling lightning released from my entire body entangled the men,
and I grabbed the faces of two stiffened men with both hands.  
"―【Ice Lance】―"  
Ice lances shot from my palms pierced through their mouths to the back
of their heads, pinning the blown-away men to the dungeon wall like a
crucifixion.  
...It wasn't even a good test for my return. You guys were unlucky
too.  
Because...  
"The ones here are the strongest forces in this country, you know?"

It's good that Snow-chan seems to be having fun.
