## 284 Encounter

On the road leading to the border of the Fandora Theocracy, our carriage
detected an ambush by bandits... but the presence of those bandits is
disappearing.  
It would be fun if a big monster had appeared and was attacking them,
but it doesn't seem to be the case...  
  
According to what I heard in town, around the Holy Church's main temple
in the Sars Continent, the Fandora Theocracy, many Holy Knights patrol
and exterminate powerful monsters.  
...Well, to gather believers, the Holy Church, which arbitrarily decided
that dark elves with just dark skin were humanoid monsters and enemies
of humanity, couldn't very well acknowledge monsters, could they?  
However, low-level beast-humanoids like goblins, who are only strong in
reproduction, and magic wolves, who are only fast at escaping, haven't
been completely exterminated, and even Holy Knights, who can cross
borders almost freely, haven't been able to deal with the bandits on the
neighboring side of the border.  
If that's the case, did the Temple Knights come all the way over to this
side this time...?  
  
"...I can see them now."  
To be precise, I still can't see much, but I can hear many living
creatures moving, dust rising into the sky, and what sounds like
screams.  
But I don't hear the clashing of swords from people fighting. And it's
more like...  
"Screams... I wonder?"  
My lips naturally curved into a smile as I realized that, and my feet
quickened.  
Ah... this is going to be fun.  
  
***"―Gyaaaaaahhh!!"***  
A scream like a pig being torn apart echoed, and the thick scent of
blood filled the air.  
It seemed there were still survivors, but as I approached, the corpses
of men who looked like bandits were already scattered on the ground.  
"They're not just mountain bandits, are they?"  
I used my foot to flip over a few corpses and checked their equipment.  
They weren't dressed in rags like local farmers who turn to banditry out
of desperation. But they weren't like the assassin's guild, either, with
equipment for disguise. They all wore the same gear, as if they were a
coordinated unit.  
Could this be an assassination squad used by nobles...?  
Not individuals hired by someone like the assassin's guild to
assassinate, but a private force of nobles, etc., meant to eliminate
political rivals of their master, acting as a group, not shying away
from sacrifices, and ensuring the death of guarded targets.  
  
With this equipment and number of people, I could believe we were the
target, but we have no reason to be targeted, as we're not involved in
politics.  
There might be factions within the Holy Church who don't want the Hero
to gain more comrades, but if so, what is the entity that's killing
them...?  
Perhaps that person is―  
"―Tch!"  
  
Suddenly, wind magic was unleashed from beyond the forest with a surge
of "killing intent," and I blocked it with a shield of ice as it tore
through the trees in its path.  
"Oh my..."  
Sensing my "killing intent," which had inadvertently leaked out at the
strong presence, "someone" in the distance suddenly unleashed an attack
spell.  
To this "enemy" who attacked without a word, I cast off my cloak and
enveloped myself in mana, my pure white hair, different from before,
fluttering like wings in the aftermath.  
  
"―【Levitate】―"  
My body floated gently, and I flew towards the direction the magic was
unleashed from.  
What a rude person, to shoot magic without even a greeting. As a
greeting, I slammed my 《Killing Intent》 and 《Intimidation》 deep into
the forest, and in response to it, a huge rock came flying, snapping
trees as it went, accompanied by an intimidating presence.  
"―【Ice Lance】―"  
  
BOOOM!!  
With a roar, the huge rock and an ice pillar as thick as a tree trunk
collided, scattering a large amount of rock and ice fragments around.  
"An even match...?"  
Seeing them as an equal to my mana, I suddenly became interested in my
opponent.  
"It would be fun if I could kill them... Oh?"  
I felt the "presence" of that opponent rapidly approaching.  
Did I hurt their pride a little? I understand. You realized that your
Level 4 【Stone Cannon】 was nullified by my Level 3 【Ice Lance】,
didn't you?  
"Welcome. I'm the one who hurt your pride."  
  
A strong presence and mana were rapidly heading towards me.  
They used powerful magic, but are they not a mage, just like Alia?  
"―【Digvolt】―"  
They might have realized I was a mage and intended to strike directly,
but I have no obligation to humor them.  
When I unleashed an expanded lightning strike, imbued with more mana, to
envelop a corner of the forest, I heard multiple screams, indicating
that the assassination squad was still there.  
As if to drown out those screams, a huge surge of mana erupted from
their direction.  
  
GOOOOOHHH!!  
At that moment, the flames of 【Fire Breath】 pierced through,
nullifying my lightning strike.  
The surrounding forest ignited with a massive flame, truly like a
dragon's breath, and the voices of the remaining assassination squad
were cut short by the aftermath.  
And here I was, trying not to burn it...  
"―【Ice Storm】―"  
My Level 5 ice magic raged, engulfing the flames of the burning
forest.  
At that moment―  
  
ZAN!!  
The forest, the flames, and the raging blizzard were all cut in half,
and the aftermath transformed into blades of magic, assailing me.  
"―!"  
GIN!!  
The 【Ice Whip】 I used in a hurry... was cut through.  
No way!? It even stopped Alia's knife.  
It's probably a high-level combat technique, not magic. In the instant
the ice whip was cut, the hem of my dress, which I had jumped back to
avoid, was slashed, and at the same time, I unleashed lightning towards
the "shadow" that had burst out from the torn forest.  
"―【Chase Lightning】―!"  
  
Multiple unleashed lightning bolts changed direction, pursuing the
"shadow."  
But that "shadow" further increased its speed, deliberately leaping into
my embrace and breaking through the lightning's range.  
The rapidly approaching "shadow" thrust a sword towards my heart.  
But no, you can't. I've decided that only Alia can plunge a blade into
my heart.  
Twisting my body to avoid at least my vital organs, I increased my mana
and chanted 【Freeze】, aiming for a mutual strike.  
At that moment―  
  
SHING!!  
  
"―Alia!"  
Interrupting in that instant, blocking the blade's tip, was Alia,
wielding a black knife and dagger.  
She must have come to see as the battle intensified...  
"Step back."  
Alia and the "shadow," who had parried the enemy's sword with their two
weapons and created distance, leaped out simultaneously as they
separated, both raising their weapons at the same time.  
  
"―【Dancing Reaper】―!"  
"―【Vorpal Blade】―!!"  
  
Alia's Level 5 dagger technique was unleashed. But matching it, a young
man's voice... his Level 5 sword technique exploded, meeting Alia's
combat technique.  
Eight consecutive strikes and five consecutive strikes. Yet, due to the
difference in weapon length, they perfectly clashed and nullified each
other, and the two were repelled again, creating a large distance,
allowing us to finally confirm the "shadow"... the opponent's
appearance.  
  
"Oh my... so it was a girl."  
The one who uttered such a carefree line was a young man, probably in
his late teens.  
Flowing black hair and red eyes...  
He smiled sweetly with a youthful face, then narrowed his eyes as he
looked at the wary Alia and me, lowering his unsheathed one-handed
sword.  
"Could it be, you... no, you *two*? I was planning to lure out an enemy,
but I had an unexpectedly good encounter. To think there wouldn't just
be one, but two champion-class individuals."  
  
Saying that, he floated back, creating even more distance, sheathed his
sword, and gave us a full-faced smile.  
"I wasn't keen on it, but now I have something to look forward to.
...I'll be waiting. In the Holy City."  
With that, he vanished with the speed of wind.  
After confirming his figure had completely disappeared and his presence
was gone, we both exhaled simultaneously.  
"Snow... that was..."  
"Yes, indeed..."  
  
That strength. That was probably... the "Hero."  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Hero" has finally appeared. How powerful are they?  
  
Next time, to the Holy City.
