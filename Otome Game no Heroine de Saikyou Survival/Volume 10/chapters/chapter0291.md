## 291 Intentions

***"GYAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
"Hmph!"  
An old man named Douglas cut down a lizard-like monster shaped like a
chicken... or is it a lizard? It was a reptilian monster, about the
height of an adult.  
I hadn't seen such a monster in Claydale or the west, so it might be a
unique monster to this grassland, this rocky mountain, or this area.  
Such monsters frequently appeared, but Douglas usually cut them down
with a single blow, so they were hardly a problem. If there was a
problem, it was perhaps the irritated swordsman Neidhardt, who kept
getting annoyed every time they stopped.  
  
"...Snow."  
Alia muttered my name, glaring at me with just her eyes, as I watched
the Hero's party. ...For some reason, I feel like I'm being scolded like
this every time I do something.  
"I know."  
It's because I did something on my own again, isn't it?  
  
My body is much better. Much better than when I cleared that large-scale
dungeon. But even though I have four attributes now, two of them are
composite skills, and my magic stone should be much larger than
Cere’zhula's, who also has four attributes.  
She originally maintained attributes that were a burden even when solely
focused on magic, and fought in close combat on the front lines, just
like Alia. Then, forced to hide in the underworld, she couldn't
recuperate and her body was no longer capable of prolonged combat.  
  
Adventurer-level combat isn't much of a burden. The pain still remains,
but I'm used enough to it not to show it on my face.  
Compared to when I fought Alia in the Royal Capital, there's a world of
difference.  
But Alia is afraid that if I push myself, I'll end up like Cere’zhula.  
She doesn't need to worry...  
Because I've decided to use my life for her.  
  
"Let's go already!"  
The battle ended quickly, and the irritated Neidhardt yelled at us.  
"To shout so loudly when we're this close... is he hard of hearing?"  
"Snow..."  
When I said that so only Alia next to me could hear, she must have been
thinking the same thing, as I wasn't scolded this time.  
  
The reason we can chat so leisurely is because we're behind them.  
Normally, it's standard for a scout like Alia to go first in an
adventurer party, but these three stopped us from going ahead.  
The reason for this was that Douglas didn't approve of being behind
young women, and Neidhardt felt the same, but he also seemed to look
down on female adventurers.  
As for the Hero... I don't know what Klein is thinking, but he probably
thought it would be more interesting this way.  
In any case, the root of the reason is that they still don't trust us...
I wonder?  
  
If this is the case, it wouldn't be any different if we stayed with
Dalton and the Temple Knights further back.  
They are following us from about two hundred paces away.  
Their role now is to exterminate surrounding monsters and secure a
retreat. They should be fine, but I'm concerned that only reptiles have
appeared since we entered this rocky mountain.  
  
"Ladies, we'll be arriving at the center soon."  
As we proceeded deeper into the rocky mountain, and large rock
formations became more frequent, with the path winding through gaps in
the rocks, Klein, who was walking ahead, called out to us.  
Even though it's a rocky mountain, the summit isn't the highest point
like a normal mountain. It's more like a mountain where many rocks were
buried, and over long years, the soil and sand weathered away... To put
it simply, it's like a stack of blocks a child haphazardly built.  
So the center isn't the highest point, but among the many gaps in the
rock formations, the largest gap is apparently the Fire Dragon's
temporary nest.  
If that's the center of the rocky mountain... perhaps the Fire Dragon
created it.  
  
From there, we proceeded cautiously. Aside from the taciturn Douglas,
even Neidhardt's words became fewer. More than that...  
"It's hot."  
It's not a volcano or anything, but the temperature is rising with every
step we take. I don't dislike the heat, but walking is still tiring
since I'm not fully recovered. At my murmur, Alia looked up, narrowed
her eyes as if scrutinizing something, and whispered softly.  
"The fire mana are getting stronger."  
  
Just as I thought we were finally about to face the Fire Dragon,
Douglas, who was leading the way, suddenly turned around.  
"You two, don't interfere. Just watch our battle from there."  
"Douglas!"  
Neidhardt exclaimed at the sudden remark.  
This Fire Dragon subjugation was supposed to be to confirm Alia's power.
If she truly had the ability to defeat the Dark Dragon, then there would
be no reason for the Hero, who was informed of this continent's threat
by the spirits, to be here.  
"Neidhardt... we're not so weak as to make these girls fight. If the
three of us are here, even an elemental dragon shouldn't be a
problem."  
"That's true, but..."  
Neidhardt frowned, glanced at us, and clicked his tongue softly.  
"Hmph. Just watch our power. This world only needs us, who have been
chosen by the spirits!"  
  
With that, Neidhardt and Douglas moved ahead.  
What is Douglas thinking? Does he have some thoughts about Klein's
actions? Neidhardt is simple. He seems to have prioritized his own
emotions over the Hero's intentions.  
"What will you do, Alia?"  
"...Let's go."  
Whether to witness or to assess, Alia decided to proceed. I don't know
what Klein is thinking the most, but if we don't know that, we'll be on
the defensive.  
My opinion isn't necessary. Besides, I also need to assess things.  
  
As we, each with our own intentions, started moving on our own, Klein,
shrugging with a mask-like smile, let out a faint murmur as if sighing
lightly.  
"...That's a problem, though."  
  
What does he mean by that?  
It seems Klein has other intentions besides observing our abilities. If
it has nothing to do with Alia, there's no problem, but if―  
  
"―Here."  
Douglas's voice from the front interrupted my thoughts.  
Indeed, a familiar sensation... I feel strong fire mana. But in the
center of the rocky mountain we reached―a wide, flat space like an
arena―the target Fire Dragon was nowhere to be seen.  
But we hadn't come to the wrong place. The wide space was littered with
the remains of what looked like large beast bones, all bearing marks as
if they had been crushed by immense force.  
  
"...Tch, it hasn't returned yet."  
"It seems not."  
Douglas responded to Neidhardt's complaint, crushing a bone as if to
examine it.  
From its condition, the bones seemed to have been left for a long
time... probably several hundred years. Or perhaps they were burned
until they became that brittle.  
"Klein! Let's regroup with the others behind us for now!"  
At Neidhardt's words, Klein said nothing, maintaining his mask-like
smile, and at that moment, Alia's head snapped up as if startled.  
"Snow!"  
  
―Whoosh!  
The next moment, something cut through the air, and everyone
instinctively moved away from the spot, as the carcass of a giant beast
crashed down with a tremor.  
But that wasn't the problem. Everyone looked up at the sky, where a
"dragon" covered in crimson scales, with its massive wings spread,
glared down at us as if scrutinizing us.
