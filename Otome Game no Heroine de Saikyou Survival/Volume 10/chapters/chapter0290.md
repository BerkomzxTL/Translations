## 290 Dragon Hunting Grounds

"...Snow?"  
"Yes, I'm fine."  
Alia called out to me with a curious look, as I had been continuously
staring in the direction the Fire Dragon had flown off to.  
I was indeed captivated by the Fire Dragon. Its crimson scales and the
sight of it soaring with its wings spread were certainly breathtakingly
beautiful, but that wasn't it.  
I was captivated by the power emanating from the Fire Dragon, the fire
elemental mana I had lost... a power so immense it felt like it could
destroy everything.  
Hehe. Do I still have destructive impulses within me? Or was it just
nostalgia?  
One thing is for sure, though: there's something I want to break.  
  
After that, we returned to the carriage and reported to Dalton and the
others. Well, Alia was the one who reported, but the topic of discussion
was the combat strength of the Hero's party. Hero Klein, whose combat
power is still unknown. Douglas, the heavy warrior, and Neidhardt, the
swordsman.  
"So, can the Hero's party defeat the elemental dragon?"  
"Probably, I don't think there'll be a problem."  
Alia nodded slightly, though still pondering, at Feld's question.  
It's still troublesome not knowing their combat power. It's just a
guideline, and their true ability can only be known by fighting them,
but it serves as a clear indicator. Still, Alia must have sensed
something, as she believed the Heroes could hunt the elemental dragon
without issue.  
  
The Fire Dragon is probably above Rank 7. Even the Dark Dragon that Alia
and the others fought to the death and defeated was only just Rank 7,
and I heard they only won because it didn't take to the sky due to its
hatred for humans.  
Alia and I defeated a Rank 7 Chimera, but that one had almost no combat
experience and, to begin with, no intelligence.  
But the Fire Dragon is different. It has spent a long time as an
elemental dragon and possesses intelligence.  
No one on this continent had ever dared to challenge it. Perhaps some
did, but they probably just died, plain and simple.  
  
"Then, we'll proceed with caution. In many ways."  
After about fifteen minutes of discussion, we were called out as the
Hero's entourage and the Temple Knights departed, and we also set off in
our carriage at Dalton's command.  
Caution is necessary, isn't it? Truly, in "many ways"...  
Because we don't know what choices those three will make.  
  
After that, we entered the Kingdom of Zentore, the country closest to
the "Dragon Hunting Grounds," without any problems. The "lack of
problems" was because no one came to greet the Hero when he entered the
country. Apparently, the Hero disliked trouble, or perhaps he
deliberately didn't contact the Kingdom of Zentore.  
From the Kingdom of Zentore's perspective, if the Holy Church's Hero
were coming, they'd probably give him a grand welcome and even throw a
ball.  
And if they found out the Hero came to subjugate the Fire Dragon, they
might even send out their own army to declare occupation of the "Dragon
Hunting Grounds" to steal the credit.  
  
That's how much the Kingdom of Zentore desires fertile grasslands. Even
before entering this country, flat roads became scarce, and while there
were many forests, there were clearly fewer plains suitable for farming
and ranching.  
If that were the case, they should have focused on specialty products
that could grow in such land, but what they chose was plunder through
conflict.  
"Well, that doesn't matter anyway."  
"You're right."  
"Aren't you two being too detached?"  
Jesha, who had taken over driving from Feld, gave Alia and me an
exasperated look.  
It's fine. For me, nothing truly matters except Alia.  
  
"Hero-dono is apparently heading straight for the "Dragon Hunting
Grounds.""  
Temple Knight Vincent appeared and informed us of this while we were at
an inn in a post town, having taken rooms and eaten. Of course, the Hero
and his party were at a different inn. Too much trouble otherwise.  
Even so... Vincent. He's a big shot in the Holy Church, isn't he? Why is
he running errands like this?  
Well, he himself looks displeased, perhaps unwilling. He must be earnest
by nature.  
I didn't pay much attention to the conversation, as I was quite fond of
this flat-baked buckwheat dish.  
  
Vincent doesn't think highly of the Hero. To be precise, he respects the
"Hero," but he doesn't seem to like that the one bearing that name is
"Klein."  
As long as Klein has the backing of the Holy Church, he shouldn't be
able to act strangely while Vincent is watching... but Klein's
principles of action are too different from ours, making him
unpredictable.  
Vincent seems to want to say something to us, but I don't understand
what religious people think.  
  
A few days later, we almost completely bypassed the Kingdom of Zentore
and headed for the vast grassland known as the "Dragon Hunting Grounds,"
where the Fire Dragon supposedly resides.  
It took over ten more days from the Kingdom of Zentore. There are no
proper roads in the grassland, and the carriage's progress was slow.
It's incredibly troublesome, but we don't mind plain food, and being
able to sleep in the carriage might be better than what the Temple
Knights have.  
"Snow."  
"Not yet."  
There's no way I can easily use a toilet magic like the light magic
【Cleanse】, you know.  
Still, we're better off. But aside from the nonchalant Hero Klein, the
Hero's companions... especially Neidhardt, the swordsman who seems to be
of noble birth, looked irritated by this pointless journey.  
  
"Klein, let's finish this quickly!"  
"It's not good to rush too much, you know?"  
"Shut up, let's go!"  
As soon as they reached their destination, Neidhardt finished his
preparations alone and urged those around him. Klein shrugged at him,
then looked at Douglas, the warrior, as if seeking agreement, but
Douglas remained sullen and silent.  
Even though I say "destination," we're not just standing in the middle
of the grassland.  
The Fire Dragon's dwelling place is apparently on Holy Mountain Kyrios,
and the Fire Dragon only uses these rocky areas as a temporary home when
it hunts large prey.  
The Fire Dragon should definitely appear here within a few days... or so
they say.  
"It's here."  
"Yeah."  
The air in the rocky mountain was different. There was talk of Wyverns
being there besides the Fire Dragon, but they weren't visible.  
As if in awe of some powerful presence...  
Just as everyone was preparing to proceed on foot, Klein suddenly said
something unexpected.  
  
"Well then, we will go ahead, but Alia-san. I'll have you move to our
party."  
Alia frowned at his words, and even Neidhardt looked back.  
"Klein! Are you really going to make that woman a companion?!"  
"That was the intention from the start, wasn't it?"  
"I haven't agreed."  
As Neidhardt and Klein began to argue, Alia calmly interjected, and
Klein smiled broadly, narrowing his eyes.  
"This time, I just want you to prove that you can properly fight a
dragon. If you don't have a certain level of power, you'll be burnt to a
crisp by the dragon's breath, but are you still planning to put your
companions in front?"  
"............"  
  
Dalton and the others aren't weak. Still, if a breath attack is
unleashed in a rocky mountain with no escape, there's a non-zero chance
that everyone except the heavily armored Dalton could die. If stronger
people go ahead, the rear becomes safer, but this is like taking
hostages, isn't it?  
Alia surely can't refuse. So―  
"In that case, may I also participate?"  
Klein's smile deepened as I stepped forward and said that.  
"...Yes. I was planning to invite you too."  
  
From that battle in the forest, I knew he wouldn't refuse my
participation.  
Alia is looking at me with a subtle expression, but I'm sorry, Alia.
...I hate being moved by someone else's agenda.
