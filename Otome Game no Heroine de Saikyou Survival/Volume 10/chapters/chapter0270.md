## 270 Unconventional Strategy

The Rank 7 monster, Chimera.  
Alia could fight it, but she had no means to defeat it, and while the
little cat, being of the same beast type, was Rank 6, the difference in
combat power was directly the difference in strength.  
The little cat's combat arts could inflict damage, but even so, the
difference in power meant it wouldn't be a decisive blow.  
And even I, as I am now... couldn't defeat the Chimera.  
Normally, it's an opponent at a level where you can barely inflict
damage even with a gift, so in my current state, I couldn't overcome the
Chimera's regenerative power.  
Even if I could use my gift, the power is slightly reduced due to the
loss of the fire attribute, so I don't even know if I could achieve the
previous power.  
  
I thought...  
What is a "mage" in a party?  
Before, I only thought about becoming strong alone.  
To sink a great nation into a sea of fire by myself, to annihilate
knight orders alone, to slaughter high-ranking warriors alone, to burn
down cities alone―I sought only pure "power."  
But that was beyond human limits. For that, I had no choice but to
sacrifice my very life.  
So, what does a mage in an adventurer's party, like Alia's, do?  
Probably the opposite of what I used to do...  
Using the knowledge to become a mage, assessing the battle situation,
and using magic to leverage the party, not just the individual.  
But... that's not like me, is it?  
  
"Alia... listen to me."  
When I explained it very simply, Alia frowned at me, giving me a look of
exasperation.  
"Are you an idiot...?"  
Alia said that, then sharply focused her gaze forward.  
"Alright, let's do it."  
"That's what I like about you."  
I knew Alia would say that.  
  
"Nero."  
***"Gaa..."***  
When Alia murmured briefly and moved her fingertips to give
instructions, the little cat, who had been keeping its distance and
distracting the Chimera, let out a brief, displeased sound and tensed
its entire body as if coiling up.  
"―World Rejection―"  
Light emanated from Alia's entire body, and at the same time, she
appeared right in front of the Chimera.  
"Haaah!"  
Alia swung her blade at the Chimera.  
  
***"GIIIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
The Chimera screamed from the "phantom pain" of being cut all over its
body.  
The Chimera's pain receptors are dull, so that scream wasn't from pain.
The Chimera had been wary of Alia, who had high combat power. So this
scream must have been more from astonishment than pain.  
But it didn't end there―  
  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
THUD!!  
The little cat, who had leaped out simultaneously with Alia and was
circling the hall, aimed for the moment Alia attacked and the Chimera
was confused, striking with a claw attack combat art from the side.  
***"GIIYAAAAAH!!"***  
The Chimera immediately regained its posture by bracing its multiple
legs and turned its claws and fangs towards kitty-chan.  
The little cat, having just used a combat art, couldn't dodge.  
It knew this too. Both kitty-chan and Alia, as warrior types, the
standard practice is to create an opening for the enemy and avoid
counterattacks.  
That's precisely why―  
"―"Light Night"―"  
At that moment, Alia intervened between the two massive bodies,
deflecting the Chimera's attack as if to hide the little cat from it.  
  
It's not as easy as it sounds. It requires the delicacy and courage to
deflect a descending blade with a fingertip. Moreover, Alia used the
light and darkness of Illusory Magic, deflecting multiple attacks with
kicks and punches without even inflicting pain on the enemy, enduring a
Rank 7 attack.  
Although she didn't use an activation word, that movement must be close
to the dagger skill level 5 combat art 【Dancing Reaper】.  
Other combat arts cannot be layered with the combat art 【Iron Rose】.
But Alia recreated the combat art, which she had used countless times
and ingrained in her body, purely by feel.  
Even so, it must put immense strain on her body. It's not something she
can use repeatedly.  
  
Both Alia and kitty-chan were giving their all. Considering the battle
situation might change, they stopped fighting with reserves and poured
out all their strength. Even in the current offense and defense, if they
had mishandled even one of the Chimera's fangs or claws, it would have
been over.  
So...  
"Not yet."  
Both Alia and the little cat, and even the Chimera, had stopped moving
for a moment in the current offense and defense... just for the blink of
an eye.  
"―【Rock Blast】―"  
I, clinging to kitty-chan's tail, fired a Rock Blast from almost
directly above at close range, the rocks embedding themselves while
pulverizing several of its heads.  
***"GIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
This time, the Chimera's scream of damage truly echoed.  
  
You weren't that wary of me, the one with the lowest combat power, were
you? An unconventional strategy only works because the enemy has
intelligence.  
At that moment, the instant Alia started moving, she simultaneously
involved me in her movement, passing me to kitty-chan who crossed paths
with us midway.  
Should I say I was caught rather than grabbed?  
  
"―【Cataract】―"  
This isn't the end, you know?  
A gigantic mass of water created in mid-air was slammed onto the rocks,
embedding them further, and at the same time―  
BOOM!!  
The embedded rocks exploded, blowing away the Chimera's back.  
***"―――――――――!!!"***  
The genuine screams from the Chimera's multiple heads filled the vast
space.  
  
"Nero!!"  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!"***  
Seizing the opportunity, Alia and kitty-chan slashed and crushed the
remaining heads.  
But at that moment―  
  
***"―――――――――――"***  
A cacophony of multiple beasts.  
The grotesque monster transformed into something even more grotesque.  
Something massive burst from the Chimera's pulverized back, blowing away
kitty-chan's huge body, and Alia barely dodged but was slammed to the
floor.  
And I―  
"Snow!!"  
Alia's voice echoed.  
At the same time, something massive also protruded from the Chimera's
rear, and a huge log-like object sent my body flying.  
  
"―!"  
Even the layered 【Rock Skin】, 【Water Veil】, and even 【Blessing】
were stripped away in an instant, and I, with broken arms and ribs,
vomited blood as I flew through the air.  
***"GIIIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"***  
Immediately, the Chimera, now transformed into an abomination, pursued
me.  
Four massive, twisted limbs...  
Gigantic wings formed by bundles of tentacles extending from its
back...  
Its form, refined and specialized for battle, looked like a "dragon"
with multiple heads.  
  
In this state, I probably can't fight...  
Ah...  
"...Just as calculated."  
  
I was thrown to the rear of the Chimera. Getting this much damage was
unexpected, but the direction and distance were as planned.  
An adventurer party's mage fights differently from how I fight.  
To dream such a fleeting "dream."  
For me to fight for anyone other than Alia―  
  
It's truly not "me"...  
  
The way a mage fights? Just crush them with violence.  
  
That's why I was thrown in this direction.  
I knew from the beginning that even repeatedly casting Level 5 magic had
a low chance of defeating the Chimera.  
So, with no decisive blow, I had the two of them go all out to distract
the Chimera.  
In the meantime, I would get behind the Chimera as much as possible.  
The intelligent Chimera, even when moving in battle, never let us get
behind its flanks.  
What happens if you get behind the Chimera?  
Even in that isolated island dungeon, the moment I moved, the Minotaur
Murderer chased after me. Monsters bound by the dungeon had to do so.  
So, it chased me, who was blown to the rear, abandoning Alia and the
little cat who had shown an opening, just to pursue me.  
  
THUD!  
My body slammed against the floor, and even with magic defense, a broken
rib must have pierced something, as more blood stained my mouth.  
The Chimera closed in on me.  
But, too bad for you...  
I didn't even need to fly myself; the distance was sufficient.  
  
"...I've come for you, Dungeon "Spirit.""  
  
I, having been blown away, arrived faster than the Chimera could catch
up, and placed my blood-stained hand on the altar in the deepest part.

What does Snow wish for...  
Next time, that power will be revealed! Is this kind of development okay
for an afterstory?!  
  
Volume 6 of the book version seems to be released around the same time
as Volume 3 of the comic adaptation.
