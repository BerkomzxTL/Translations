## 268 The Monster in the Deepest Part

Alia, the little cat, and I continued our conquest of the large
dungeon.  
You could say the conquest itself was going smoothly... I guess.  
Large dungeons are supposed to become more complex the deeper you go,
and the travel speed should decrease unless you know the route, but on
the contrary, our progress speed had increased.  
The number of monsters had noticeably decreased. I think, as we
predicted, the monsters on the lower levels are heading towards the
lowest floor.  
  
"Snow."  
"...There are corpses left."  
For a moment, I didn't realize I was being called by my name, and my
reply was delayed, but I understood what Alia wanted to say.  
In dungeons, monster corpses don't remain. There are theories that the
dungeon absorbs them, but in reality, isn't it because other monsters
eat them without leaving even bones?  
The deeper we went, the less we saw monsters, and instead, we started
seeing monster corpses.  
But why are there monster corpses? Why are they left uneaten? It's
because...  
"As expected, the culling has begun."  
  
Let's review monster knowledge.  
Monsters are the end result of animals that mutated from absorbing too
much magic essence. Even so, it's said that some monsters have mutated
so much that they no longer resemble ordinary animals because they've
undergone repeated generational changes while remaining monsterized,
thus evolving.  
Some are mutated by ancient elven magic, or creatures from places like
the highly magic-dense fairy realm, but setting those aside, ordinary
monsters are naturally aggressive and attack and devour other living
beings.  
It's said that monsters attack humans because it's efficient to prey on
humans, who are numerous and absorb a lot of magic essence, but I
believe it's because a statistically high number of humans possess
"magic stones."  
As if to confirm that hypothesis, all the monster corpses scattered
throughout the dungeon had their hearts devoured.  
Perhaps by devouring the magic stone in the heart, monsters are trying
to self-evolve?  
  
"So, if humans eat monster magic stones, they'll get stronger too?"  
"I don't think that's possible. Humans are animals, not monsters, and
monsters don't even look at dead magic stones extracted from the
heart."  
  
That's just too much gluttony. I think they can't absorb the power
unless they devour the magic stone along with the still-beating heart.
But...  
  
"...Could I manage a monster about the size of a rabbit?"  
"............"  
***"Gaa."***  
―Stop―  
―Foolish―  
  
Oh dear, kitty-chan got angry with me. I wonder if it thought we might
actually do it. It seems impossible to absorb directly unless you're a
monster.  
However, I don't think humans don't absorb anything at all.  
Magic stones extracted from the hearts of dead monsters are already
dead. I don't know what the difference is, but it's possible that when a
monster dies, that "something" dissipates, and the one who defeated it
unconsciously absorbs it.  
Otherwise, there's no reason why a human who reached Rank 5 could fight
on par with a griffon or a wyvern.  
Well, it's just my speculation. I think it's like daily meals; if you
don't consume the right amount, it's meaningless.  
If you get the amount wrong... perhaps ogres and orcs are mutated
species that monsterized from humans in that way.  
  
―Foolish―  
  
That day... I happened to encounter a monster (rabbit) and tried to
butcher it alive, but it counterattacked, and kitty-chan got angry with
me again.  
  
The next day, we continued to rush through the dungeon on the little
cat.  
We no longer encountered monsters. Although there were some traps and
mazes, making it troublesome, we passed through purely with the little
cat's physical abilities.  
However, not encountering monsters also meant we couldn't procure
food.  
Alia's and my 【Shadow Storage】 still had leftover food, but kitty-chan
couldn't go without. We gave all the monster meat we had hunted and
saved to kitty-chan, and by the time we were thoroughly tired of simple
barley porridge with just beans, dried vegetables, and a small amount of
jerky, we finally saw the end of the dungeon.  
  
"Is this the deepest part?"  
"Most likely, yes."  
We descended a long staircase and emerged into a slightly wider space.  
Beyond what was probably just a plaza for preparation, there was a
gigantic double-door made of metal.  
Both Alia and I were speaking fewer words than necessary. The little cat
also narrowed its eyes, and its fur stood on end as if slightly charged
with electricity.  
The oppressive feeling emanating from beyond the door... As we
dismounted from the little cat's back and approached on foot, just as we
were wondering how to open that massive door―  
  
BOOM!!  
With a roar, something crashed from the other side of the door, causing
it to buckle inwards, bulging towards us.  
""―!""  
As we jumped back, the buckled door creaked open, and a gigantic
humanoid shadow emerged from within.  
More than twice our height. Its weight, I couldn't even guess how many
tens of times ours, it was...  
  
"Goblin King...!"  
  
The highest species of goblin-type. Rank 6, comparable to a Minotaur
Murderer.  
That giant body, with a combat power exceeding 3000, glared at us with
bloodshot eyes from the darkness of the doorway and took a step
forward.  
But...  
  
***"―GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!"***  
A black spear, which had already pierced the blood-soaked Goblin King's
belly from the other side, was recognized as a "snake" in an instant. At
that moment, there was "something" that easily dragged the Goblin King's
massive body deeper inside, as if reeling it in, as the Goblin King
reached out to us for salvation.  
The Goblin King, flung into the air as if caught by a single fishing
line and pulled in, was crushed by multiple gigantic jaws and died.  
  
"...Snow."  
It must not be in Alia's knowledge. Called upon, I quickly gave up
trying to recall from common knowledge and instead remembered the
contents of the Leicester family's forbidden books, which I had read
since childhood.  
As a result of the culling among monsters, the surviving goblins from
the original humanoid monsters evolved into a Goblin King through
cannibalism.  
But at the same time, beast-type monsters were also culled, and probably
due to the dungeon's intervention, a distorted life form that should not
have been born normally came into existence.  
A bear-like torso covered in scales, with six legs from various
beasts.  
Distorted black wings and black horns.  
A long, extended snake tail and multiple heads resembling a lion, a
wolf, and a monkey.  
A blasphemy against life that should not have been born naturally... it
was...  
  
"...Chimera..."  
  
【Chimera】【Species: Demonic Beast】【Demonic Beast Type Rank 7】  
【Magic Power: 307/350】【Health: 1034/1180】  
【Total Combat Power: 7306】  
  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"***
