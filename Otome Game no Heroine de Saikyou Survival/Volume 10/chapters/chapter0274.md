## 274 Daily Life in the Royal Capital

"Alia brought her, didn't she? Then it should be fine, right?"  
"Well, it is Alia-chan, after all."  
"If Dalton decided it, I've got no complaints..."  
  
They're surprisingly nonchalant, aren't they?  
The day after Alia went to see the princess, I met the other members of
"Rainbow Blade."  
Is it really okay for it to be this easy? Well, I suppose it just means
they trust Alia that much. ...Though some people are a bit hesitant.  
"―!"  
When I smiled at the vertically and horizontally large dwarf girl, she
took a step back with a strained smile.  
  
"Jesha, she's scary, but she's not a bad person."  
Saying that, the vertically huge muscle... I think it was Feld? He
cheerfully said it while patting both Jesha's and my heads.  
Whether he's easygoing or just doesn't care about the details, it's not
for me to say, but I couldn't help but stare at him, wondering how he
could pat the head of a murderer like me.  
"N-no way I'm scared!"  
That's true, isn't it? It's almost as if I'm more dangerous than an
attribute dragon.  
The other elf, Mira, was as unfazed as Feld. In fact, I was surprised to
find candy in my pocket at some point.  
Originally, there was also a scout named Viro, one of Alia's mentors,
but he seems to be retiring and becoming a knight of the shadows. Still,
I think a brief meeting would have been nice...  
  
"Where's Dalton?"  
"He's been called by Her Royal Highness. Viro's with him, so they're
probably making it so Snow can update her registration without having to
go to the guild."  
Feld, whom Alia had asked, even answered my unspoken question. Even
so... Alia seems to trust him quite a bit.  
It seems Viro used to act as a sub-leader, but with his retirement, Feld
has taken over that role and is giving us instructions.  
  
"For now, Alia, move according to Dalton's instructions. Also, you don't
need to go back to the academy, right?"  
"I attended the academy to guard Elena. Elena also has work at the royal
castle, so it seems I don't need to return to the academy, which means
my job is done."  
  
Well, that's how it is for high-ranking nobles who've been educated by
private tutors since childhood. The only reason high-ranking nobles
attend the academy is for networking.  
The graduation ceremony is also held at the royal castle, and
conversely, the princess probably has a tough time since she has to
oversee the reconstruction so that next year's graduation ceremony can
even happen. Still, the new students this year who thought they'd get to
meet her might be a little sad.  
After confirming all of Dalton's instructions, Feld finally pulled out
an envelope.  
"Viro says you owe him a treat sometime."  
"Understood."  
  
Alia put the received envelope into her 【Shadow Storage】 and walked
towards me.  
"What was that just now?"  
"I asked him to look into something. Shall we go now?"  
She's still a girl of few words. I can mostly guess, but I shrugged
lightly and started walking beside her.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
"Alia-chan! What have you been doing for months!?"  
As soon as we entered the shop we arrived at, Alia was scolded by a rock
dwarf in a sequined dress who appeared, clattering his steel high
heels.  
Given the state of the royal capital, it's normal to be scolded if you
haven't been in contact for months. Though it's really not my place to
talk.  
This shop is the rock dwarf's armor shop where I also ordered a dress.
If it were just an armor shop, there are larger and more skilled
artisans in the royal capital, but for a craftsman who balances design
and performance well for young women, he's the best in this country.  
Inside the shop, there's even armor that makes you wonder if it's really
armor... armor that only covers the chest and waist. I wonder if this
rock dwarf wears it?  
  
"...Oh?"  
In the back of the shop, a familiar black dress was displayed, and the
shop owner, noticing my murmur, turned to face me.  
"Ah, that's a prototype of the dress Alia-chan wore in the party. I was
thinking if I could make a new design..."  
Alia's scolding session was over, and the shop owner, who had been
speaking normally to me, her companion, froze when he saw me.  
"...A-you, that height and build, could it be―"  
"...How do you identify someone, and by what?"  
"Ah, that's right."  
Just as the shop owner was about to spill the beans, whether by
calculation or simply her "nature," Alia pulled that black *thing* out
of her 【Shadow Storage】.  
"Can this be fixed?"  
"Alia-chan!?"  
  
It was the Dark Dragon material dress she wore during our battle. It's
impressive that it didn't tear even after such a fierce fight. However,
from the creator's perspective, it seemed quite damaged, and the shock
of meeting me seemed to have flown out the window.  
  
"Oh, it's become like this! Self-repair has started with the dirt still
on it!"  
"And..."  
To the shop owner who frantically started examining the damaged black
dress, Alia apologetically pulled out a white item.  
"Hieeeeee!?"  
  
That was the Mithril thread dress I had been wearing. It was a dress
that didn't even get a scratch from a Level 1 attack magic, but that one
was magnificently stained with my blood, and with the blood still on it,
self-repair had started, making the shop owner sway like seaweed with
both hands on his cheeks.  
  
"...Aaaah, that's enough!"  
The shop owner, who had been quite shocked, suddenly revived, grabbed
the two dresses, put them into something that looked like a water tank
in the back, and then, as if in a fit of desperation, poured in some
kind of chemical.  
"Alright, I'll do it! I'll restore them completely... no! I'll remake
them so you can wear them even when you're adults, so be prepared!"  
  
Prepared for what...? As I was thinking that, Alia muttered under her
breath.  
"We're technically adults this year, aren't we?"  
"That's right, we are."  
Both Alia and I will turn fifteen this year. Nobles attend the magic
academy, so next year's graduation party doubles as the coming-of-age
ceremony, but commoners are considered adults at fifteen.  
"Will it change that much...?"  
I instinctively lifted the hem of my robe and looked at my feet.
...Still pathologically thin, as usual.  
Even so, unlike commoners, we grow with mana. For women, growth and
aging start to reverse around this time, so age fraud isn't that big of
a deal, but still, our appearance was about sixteen or seventeen.  
My height hasn't really grown, so won't it be much different? When I
voiced that thought, the shop owner glared at me fiercely.  
"What are you talking about! You have elves around you who ate too many
sweets and became a little... *that* when they grew up, don't you?!"  
"Ah."  
I see... Indeed, for a human, it would be normal, but for an elf,
compared to Cere’zhula and others, it's quite sad, isn't it? Hehe.  
  
After that, the shop owner adjusted some relatively well-fitting
ready-made items for us, and proper ones were to be custom-made.  
"He said the alterations would be done in three days, so let's prepare
by then."  
"Where are we going?"  
  
Alia said that to me as we left the shop.  
I recall Dalton saying there would be instructions. Since my identity
might be revealed if I stay in the royal capital, perhaps we'll take on
some kind of request.  
Thinking that, I urged her on, and Alia spoke the destination.  
  
"We're going to meet Samantha, the former mage of Rainbow Blade."  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Samantha will appear next time.  
I couldn't write about the Hero this time, so I'll save it for the next
one.
