## 276 Samantha Samantha

"I am Samantha Samantha!"  
"I know."  
"Who are you, little girl, to know me!"  
"Alia."  
"Hmm. Is dinner ready yet?"  
  
As expected of Alia. She's completely unfazed. In fact, when she
casually pulled out some dried meat from her 【Shadow Storage】, the old
woman showed a look of displeasure.  
"Dried stuff, no... I want crunchy meat!"  
Oh, she's surprisingly picky. But if that's the case...  
"I should have brought the bandits I froze."  
"A demon wife! There's a demon wife here!"  
When did I become a wife...?  
But is she truly senile? I can't tell if it's "senility." The little
cat, for its part, seems to have no intention of dealing with her at
all, and is curled up on Alia's shoulder as a black cat.  
  
"―Grandma!"  
Just then, such a voice was heard from afar, and someone approached,
kicking up an incredible amount of dust, then tackled the old woman who
tried to dodge, pinning her down.  
"Who are you, to capture me!?"  
"I thought you suddenly started running, but what are you doing to these
young ladies!?"  
"I had a premonition!"  
"What do you mean!?"  
The woman, who appeared to be in her twenties, turned to us and bowed
repeatedly.  
"I'm so sorry about my grandma. It must have been tough, right?"  
To the woman who spoke as if something had already gone wrong, the old
woman suddenly clapped her hands as if remembering something.  
"That's right! It's mealtime!"  
"You ate dinner the day before yesterday, didn't you?"  
"A demon wife! There's a demon wife here!"  
"Yes, yes, I'm your great-granddaughter. Look, your
great-great-grandchildren are here too~"  
"Grandma."  
Truly, from where they appeared, a small boy and girl emerged from
behind the woman who called herself the great-granddaughter, clinging to
the old woman as if climbing her.  
"Grandma, food."  
"Food, food."  
"Good! Let's go, great-great-grandchildren! You little girls, come eat
at our place too!"  
No sooner had she said that, the old woman put the two
great-great-grandchildren on her back and ran off with incredible speed
again, disappearing in a cloud of dust in an instant.  
"I'm truly sorry!"  
"Understood. It's dinner, Snow."  
Alia isn't fazed either, is she?  
  
  
***"LET'S EAT!!"***  
At that shout, dozens of people simultaneously began to eat. From the
elderly to infants present, all these people are family, apparently.  
The entire Samantha clan lives in a mansion like a castle, and despite
its vastness, there are no servants. The tasks are done by the younger
people... no, by those who can move or are good at it, it seems.  
Well, in short... it's very noisy.  
  
"Little girl, is that the little girl in question?"  
The old woman, who was eating across from me, looked at me with a sharp
gaze. Her eyes and oppressive presence were truly worthy of the name of
the veteran adventurer, "Sandstorm Witch."  
...If only several toddlers under the age of three weren't climbing all
over her body.  
"Samantha. Do you understand?"  
Alia, who was slicing a lamb sausage, asked the old woman in return.  
"It's distorted, isn't it...? And you've repeated quite a lot of
recklessness. The "War Demon" must have examined you, right? It's gotten
somewhat better, but no matter how much you extend your life, it won't
be for very long."  
"I see..."  
Alia frowned slightly at Samantha's words and gave the sliced sausage to
kitty-chan... but can the phantom little cat eat? More importantly,
since its true form is huge, would that amount even make a difference?  
"But I don't regret it?"  
Alia glared at me with a sharp look at my light tone. ...You're an
idiot. You don't need to worry about my lifespan.  
That aside...  
"What is this massive amount of blood sausage on my plate?"  
Do I look like I'm that anemic?  
  
"That Dalton fellow told me to teach you... especially that white little
girl, how a mage moves as an adventurer."  
The old woman crunched on a bone-in lamb chop, pointing at me with a
broken bone.  
"But you lot don't need such things, do you? Though still rough, in
terms of strength alone, there aren't many who can beat you, not just in
this country, but on this Saarth Continent."  
"Then what will you do?"  
My life has been extended a bit by organizing my attributes. If so, I
want to do what I can for Alia, rather than wasting time on strange
teachings.  
To me, the old woman grinned, chugging wine straight from the bottle.  
"That's why Dalton left it to me! I'll personally retrain you and
fundamentally re-regulate your life force! At the very least, I'll make
sure you don't die before me! Uhyahyahya!"  
"...Should I be happy about that?"  
Dying after someone over a hundred years old, how many years from now is
that?  
Then Alia, who had been listening, nodded deeply, as if impressed by the
old woman's words.  
"Snow, she says you can live another hundred years."  
"............"  
You're joking, right?  
  
"Then let's go, little girls!!"  
***"Grandma, have a good trip."***  
Immediately after the meal, we departed with the entire Samantha clan
seeing us off.  
I thought I had trained my mana control, but according to the old woman,
even more delicate control is needed.  
Until now, I had only focused on controlling a vast amount of mana, but
she said that by performing delicate operations, the flow of mana
becomes smoother, and it can even control blood flow itself.  
"Little girl, you too! Aren't you hungry!?"  
"Understood. I just ate."  
It seems Grandma will train Alia too. If the flow of mana becomes
smoother, the mana consumption will also decrease, so there's no loss.  
"By the way, where are we going now?"  
I asked, as we had set out on a journey but I hadn't heard the
destination, and the old woman's face turned stern for a moment.  
"Where are we going!?"  
"Somewhere we can train, right?"  
Alia answered the old woman's senility with a straight face. Did we
really just set out on a journey with only the word "training" in mind?
I couldn't help but give her a deadpan look along with kitty-chan, who
had the same expression, and the old woman clapped her hands.  
"That's right! We're going to Dandorl!"  
"Dandorl?"  
As Alia tilted her head, the old woman puffed out her chest as if it
were obvious.  
"Because a new mead product was recently released!"  
It really was "just for now," it seems.  
The journey to the viscounty, which is a vassal of Dandorl, will take
about three more weeks. ...Since we've already traveled this far,
wouldn't it be okay to rest a little?  
But Alia didn't mind, and the old woman was so spry that you wouldn't
think she was over a hundred, so my comment only resulted in an increase
in the amount of medicine Alia made.  
  
"Walking is also necessary, you white little girl!"  
By walking for long periods, the body gets used to the blood flow, and
by controlling the magic-infused blood with mana control, the burden on
the heart is apparently reduced.  
Alia, hearing that, also decided to increase my meal menu and medicine,
as suppressing something called blood fat? I've never heard that term
before, but it apparently improves blood flow.  
  
Grandma is a three-attribute mage. The number of attributes is not a
problem for health, but that's only in terms of being a mage. She said
that for a warrior-type, it only provides enough stamina to get out of
breath during prolonged combat.  
Since Grandma has a combat style that involves running around, by
training her mana control from a young age, her lifespan was extended as
a result, she says.  
"But Grandma? You love meat, don't you?"  
"A demon wife! There's a demon wife here! Let me eat what I like!"  
...Well, if she runs around that much, the fat content probably gets
consumed.  
  
After that, my meals prepared by Alia consisted only of herbal-like
leaves and lean red meat or chicken, but I wonder if I'll be able to
have a proper meal or mead once we reach our destination?  
As I muttered that, Alia opened her mouth as if remembering something.  
"Gelf said that the new product from Dandorl was apparently devised by
someone from the Dandorl family."  
"I heard that too! The little girl who devised it apparently married
into the new lord's family!"  
"Oh, really...?"  
That sounds like a story I've heard somewhere.  
From the Dandorl family, marrying into the new lord's family?  
Could that be...  
...the former prince and the young lady?
