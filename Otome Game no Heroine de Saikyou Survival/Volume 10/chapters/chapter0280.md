## 280 A New Spark

"Please wait!"  
As we were discussing our next destination after finishing our business,
I saw an Adventurer's Guild staff member, whom we had only visited once,
rushing towards us.  
"...Phew. I'm glad you were still here."  
"Is something wrong?"  
When Alia asked, the slightly plump male staff member wiped his sweat
and pulled out what looked like a document.  
"Uh... you are Alia-san and Snow-san, correct? A message has arrived
from Dalton-sama of "Rainbow Blade.""  
  
Dalton had sent out a mass communication from the Royal Capital's
Adventurer's Guild to guilds in areas where Samantha was likely to stop
by.  
Just putting up notices in various guilds would cost a considerable
amount, so how much money did it cost to even search for us and send a
message?  
The guild staff member went out of their way to find us, probably
because we were a conspicuous party of a young woman and an old woman,
and because Alia was famous.  
A Rank 5 party scout. The "Cinders" feared even by thieves and
assassins.  
Her formidable reputation, once only known in the underworld, was
gradually spreading overseas.  
  
"So, what happened?"  
"...Return to the Royal Capital immediately. That's all."  
When I asked, Alia, who had been reading the message, replied.  
"Here."  
"...Concise, isn't it?"  
The message truly contained nothing more. Conversely, it meant the
matter was that important.  
Moreover, if such a message was sent to so many guilds, intelligent
individuals would surely realize that "Rainbow Blade," which has
connections with nobles, was planning something.  
However, Dalton prioritized time over letting rival factions know.  
"Let's go back. ...Are you okay?"  
"Can't be helped, I suppose."  
  
If Alia is truly in a hurry, it means we'll cut straight through the
forest instead of using roads or carriages, heading directly there.  
My physical condition isn't completely good yet, but I've also learned
things from the old woman, so let's proceed while practicing.  
We stored the preserved food we bought at the viscounty's shops into our
【Shadow Storage】 and started heading straight southeast towards the
Royal Capital.  
...In the end, I couldn't sleep in a bed for even a single day.  
  
We used body enhancement and ran through the deep forest.  
"Living in a hurry"... I truly believe that phrase exists for us.  
Alia risked her life for what she had to do, what she must do, and for
her vow.  
I, for hatred, couldn't stop until my remaining short life ran out,
killing everything and being killed.  
People who know nothing, and people who know only kindness, would pity
us and feel sorry for us.  
People who have lived without seeing anything, or who have lived in a
narrow world, would call us monsters and fear us, who could kill even
demons in our early teens.  
While other children had their parents read them picture books until
they fell asleep in bed, we continued to fight, spitting up blood.  
And we don't regret it or look back.  
Because everything was our own decision.  
Only truly blessed people can complain to someone, I suppose.  
Do you know?  
Most of the world's grievances disappear by "dying" or "killing."  
That's why we had no choice but to become "strong."  
And we are still "living in a hurry."  
  
"You look pale."  
"...I don't need medicine."  
Seeing Alia trying to take something out of her 【Shadow Storage】 after
noticing my pale face, I instinctively stopped her.  
Because, while death isn't that scary, Alia's medicine is bitter.  
"That's right. It's about time for new medicine..."  
"That's not what I meant."  
Why would she dig up the ground for new medicine? What's in the forest
ground? Do roasted earthworms really work?  
As I stopped Alia, who was smiling with a puzzled expression, the little
cat on her shoulder sighed and made its illusionary form disappear.  
"Nero?"  
***"Gaa"***  
The next moment, the cat's "true form," as large as a small house,
appeared from Alia's shadow after she called its name.  
"What's wrong?"  
The cat, which caressed Alia's cheek with its ear-like feelers as she
stroked its nose, narrowed its eyes at me with an annoyed look.  
"He says he'll let you ride on his back."  
"...Oh, I see."  
How on earth does she understand what he's saying?  
  
After riding on the cat's back, we reached the vicinity of the Royal
Capital in just a few days, a journey that would have taken Alia's legs
over a week.  
The plan was to stop in a town for a day or two along the way, but I
missed sleeping in a bed again.  
Midway, the cat returned to Alia's shadow, and we arrived at Dalton's
mansion in the Royal Capital without any problems, where we found Dalton
about to get into a carriage.  
  
"You two were fast. Just in time. You two come too."  
"Me too?"  
It wasn't the carriage of "Rainbow Blade" as adventurers, but a carriage
that a discreet merchant would use, so surely it was *that* person who
summoned him, right?  
"Yes, you too, Snow. Just like Alia, I was told to bring you if you were
with her."  
"...Hmmph."  
She's surprisingly bold, the princess. Even though I'm supposed to be
dead, to summon the very person who destroyed the Royal Capital... does
she have a death wish?  
She's truly living in a hurry. Alia also got into the carriage as if she
didn't care... but no bed for me again.  
  
But, as expected of the princess. Whether it was planned from the
beginning, or she believed Alia would come, the princess was waiting for
us not at the Royal Castle, but at a noble's mansion nearby.  
"Welcome, Dalton, Alia. This is a former noble faction's mansion that
I've taken over, and it's under my care, so you don't have to worry
about other people's eyes. *You* too."  
"...I am deeply grateful."  
The Krusian and black-haired maids in the room glared warily at me as I
sat down on the edge of the offered sofa without removing my hood.  
It seems there are hardly any ordinary knights in this mansion, but are
the maids and servants also knights of the shadows? They're quite
skilled, all of them.  
Naturally, they're most wary of me. But since the princess has allowed
it, they can't object. How troublesome.  
  
"...We might need your strength."  
The princess sighed lightly at my faint smile and the wary maids, then
began to speak quietly.  
"First, Alia. Regarding this matter, I intend to use all my power to
protect you. I will leave the final decision to you, but please don't
forget that."  
"Understood."  
As Alia nodded, the princess paused for a moment and showed a serious
expression.  
  
"To conclude, the "Hero" who appeared from another continent, as a
formal request from the Holy Church, wishes to welcome Alia, who
possesses hero-class power, into their party."  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's here...  
Is the Hero an enemy or an ally? And what is their true strength?  
  
My new work, *The Dragon Girl's Journey Through the Post-Apocalyptic
World*, has finished its first chapter.  
I'm currently in the process of revising it, but if you like, please
give it a read.  
Your support is my motivation, so please cheer me on!  
  
Don't forget, the new volume of "Otome Survival" is on January 15th!
