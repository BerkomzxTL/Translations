## 262 Resurrection

Please feel the subtle nuances.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was supposed to die.  
In fact, I was dead.  
I couldn't see anything, couldn't hear anything. I didn't even have a
sense of my body, just a dark, cold abyss...  
But that darkness was a pain-free tranquility I hadn't experienced since
I was old enough to remember.  
The peace of "death" had finally arrived. I wished to simply fade away
into slumber... but my wish was cruelly betrayed.  
  
"............"  
Awakened by a hateful "light" from the darkness that enveloped me in
peace, the first thing I felt was the "pain" tormenting my familiar
body.  
"―Are you awake?"  
I heard a woman's voice. Perhaps my body wasn't fully functional yet, as
the sound echoed in my ears like I was underwater, and in my blurry
vision, barely open, I could only make out the outline of a woman like a
black shadow.  
A faint scent of medicinal herbs...  
Who could it be...? Friend or foe...?  
Ah, I remembered I had no friends, and tried to gather mana within my
body, but it didn't work, and I felt only the heat of my immobile body
increase.  
"...Don't push yourself, honestly."  
The woman's exasperated voice. At least she didn't seem to intend any
harm, but why did this woman, whose voice sounded young, speak like an
old person?  
"My grumpy disciple will be back soon, so sleep now... you were truly
dead until recently."  
"............"  
The woman's black hand touched my forehead.  
Ah... I really was dead. In that case, this isn't a dream, and I've
truly come back to life?  
...What a bother. Becoming too bothered to think in my hazy
consciousness, I closed my eyes, enjoying the pleasant warmth of the
hand on my forehead, and fell asleep again.  
  
"Good morning."  
"............"  
I woke up to a pungent smell and an unusually bitter taste in my mouth,
and this time, I heard the voice of an even younger girl.  
"Sleep a little more. Your stamina hasn't recovered beyond single digits
yet."  
This cold way of speaking. You're just as you always are. My blurry
vision gradually focused, and I saw sparkling pinkish-gold hair.  
She told me to sleep... but I felt better than last time, so ignoring
the pain, I tried to get up from the simple but well-washed and soft
bedding.  
"...Where... am I... Alia?"  
"My master's hermitage."  
The pink-haired girl I fought to the death—Alia.  
How much time had passed since then? Neither Alia nor I were in dresses;
Alia was in her usual adventurer's attire, and I was dressed in an
unbleached tunic.  
Alia rose from the chair at the workbench where she had been sitting,
approached me casually, grabbed my head, and pushed me back onto the
bed.  
"I've made more. Drink it."  
A thick, pungent liquid was poured directly into my mouth from a vessel
with a narrow, beak-like rim. ...So this was the bitterness that
lingered on my tongue.  
"...Is it poison...?"  
"Poison wouldn't work on you, would it?"  
Alia, without changing her expression, made me drink the rest of the
liquid as I complained.  
"...Are you angry?"  
"Of course."  
Alia replied to my words and then returned to the workbench.  
"I'm here."  
"............"  
How blunt... but that was just like her, and it made me feel more
genuinely at ease than anything anyone else could have said.  
  
After that, I slept several times and woke up several times.  
The things I was made to drink changed from poison-like medicine to
unappetizing gruel mixed with herbs, and Alia told me everything that
had happened.  
  
The reason I couldn't use fire magic was indeed because of that golden
dagger.  
The Orichalcum dagger was apparently the reward for both Alia and me for
clearing the Demon Fortress dungeon. And it was a one-time use item.
That dagger, which erased my fire attribute, shattered and
disappeared.  
Only one wish could be granted per dungeon.  
To use such a precious reward for something like that... how foolish.  
Alia had applied "medicine" to the surface of the golden dagger. Not
poison, but a cardiac stimulant. Alia, who had originally intended to
kill me once, said she gambled on the possibility that I, once dead,
would revive due to the effects of the cardiac stimulant I had received
before my death.  
  
"What were the odds?"  
"About twenty percent?"  
  
If you're coming back from the dead, that's a pretty good chance.  
But even that was apparently a high probability only achieved thanks to
my abnormal amount of mana and the easing of pressure on my heart by
losing the fire attribute.  
Also, when Alia transported me, she took advantage of my suspended
animation and put me in her 【Shadow Storage】, which helped preserve my
condition.  
Alia, who had killed me, brought my body to this place where her master
resided. Indeed, the demon woman I first saw upon waking was Alia's
master.  
  
"Treating me like luggage is harsh."  
"Should I have dragged you? You should be grateful to Nero."  
  
Indeed, without that little cat's speed, we wouldn't have reached here,
and without Alia's master, who also had heart problems, I might have
died again immediately after resuscitation.  
Where is that little kitty-chan? I thought, and when I searched for its
presence, the little cat, sensing it, appeared from Alia's shadow in the
form of a phantom "black cat" and snorted when it saw me.  
  
Even when I possessed all attributes, I was told I wouldn't live past
twenty.  
Even now, with one attribute less, due to the lifespan shaved off by
【Soul Thorn】, I probably won't live much longer than that.  
I, who had died once, was given a few more years of life.  
I was called back from the peaceful death I desired to this life full of
pain.  
"............"  
I touched my now pure white hair.  
My once jet-black hair had lost its pigment and turned pure white,
perhaps because I had died once, and I looked like a true ghost
reflected in the water.  
My parents called me a demon child, and I was a great sinner who killed
my family and many people.  
To try and save someone like me... you're truly foolish, aren't you?  
Since I can't leave such a foolish child alone, I'll use the remaining
few years of my life for you.  
  
After that, I lived with them, eating unappetizing medicine and Alia's
strange meals.  
Alia's master, as expected of a demon, knew magic, curses, and tactics
that I didn't, and I think I enjoyed her lessons and discussions about
magic.  
Several weeks passed, my condition recovered, and I was able to hunt
monsters in the forest. Then, suddenly, Alia brought two sets of
luggage.  
  
"We're going to clear a dungeon."

What do they seek in the dungeon?
