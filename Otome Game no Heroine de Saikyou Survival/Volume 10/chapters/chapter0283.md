## 283 Crossing the Border

At the Hero's invitation... or rather, at the Holy Church's request, we
were to cross the country and head north to the Holy City of Faan in the
Fandora Theocracy.  
What a pain... Well, in terms of distance, it's only about as far as
going from Melrose to Dandorl, but crossing two borders and going to a
land with different customs seems like it'll be more stressful than I
thought.  
  
"Alright, Feld, I'm counting on you."  
"Understood."  
A week after departing from the Royal Capital... we still hadn't left
the Kingdom of Claydale.  
Neither Alia nor I have reached Dark Magic Level 6 yet, so I'm really
feeling the appreciation for the days when we could casually use spatial
transfer.  
As I was thinking that, Alia, who had returned from the driver's seat,
looked at me with a fixed gaze.  
"Don't ask for casualness at the cost of your life."  
"...And you, could you please stop reading my mind so casually?"  
My supervisor really is excellent.  
  
Dalton had said that Alia and Feld were driving because it was different
from the previous trip.  
Apparently, normally, the butler from Dalton's mansion handles the
driving and inn arrangements, but this time, since they don't know what
might happen, he's staying home.  
So they take turns driving, but it's understandable that I was excluded,
let alone Dalton, the leader. I can't even ride a horse.  
The "previous time" seems to refer to when they delved into the
large-scale dungeon on the isolated island. What's different from then
is that the scout, Viro, retired from "Rainbow Blade" after becoming a
knight of the shadows, and the warrior Jesha and I, a mage, joined as
replacement members.  
Dalton's "Rainbow Blade" high-speed carriage has quite a lot of space
inside compared to a noble's carriage, but when the muscle-bound Feld
and Jesha are both in it, I feel a sense of pressure. I wonder if the
room temperature has even risen a bit?  
  
Even so, it can travel much faster than a normal carriage.  
Like a magic tool, it can even self-propel to some extent using magic
stones, and with its sturdiness and huge spatial storage, it might have
cost more than the royal carriage.  
To head to an unknown place, even if we leave the driver butler behind,
using such an expensive carriage might lead to it being totaled, you
know?  
Miranda answered my simple question.  
  
"In that case, they'll just make a new one with the reward from the
Elemental Dragon. Right, Dalton?"  
"Well, yeah. If you have money, it's better to spend it than hoard it.
Besides, the personnel has increased, so I want to have some leeway."  
Dalton added to Mira's words.  
Elemental Dragon, huh... I'm not very interested, but it seems it was
tough. Including finding Elena, they apparently received enough reward
money to live comfortably.  
"If you're remaking it, why not add a washbasin?"  
"...Are you planning to make it your home?"  
That wouldn't be bad. I'd be happy if there was a toilet too, but is
that too much to ask?  
"Snow."  
"What is it, Alia?"  
"Can't you do something with an application of 【Shadow Storage】?"  
"You're asking for the impossible, you know."  
Are you telling me to research that? Magic is certainly my specialty,
but I didn't expect to be asked such an outrageous thing.  
And please stop reading my mind so casually.  
  
About two weeks later, we arrived at the border with the neighboring
Grand Duchy of Gaudre.  
About twenty days from the Royal Capital, I suppose? Normally it should
take over a month, so it's still fast, but I'm already getting bored.  
The carriage is moving sluggishly right before the border. According to
what I heard at the last post town, it takes time for adventurers to
cross the border.  
To ordinary people, adventurers, who are free people without
citizenship, are no different from ruffians. People who easily leave the
country to earn money there aren't even citizens.  
In other words, they're suspicious, so the border crossing inspection
takes time.  
"Pass."  
"The Holy Church!?"  
However, when we showed that it was at the Holy Church's request, the
grumpy soldier hastily cleared the way and let us through.  
  
The Holy Church. The largest denomination on this continent, which came
from another continent with the Mercenians over a thousand years ago.  
The authority of its name is immense, but I can't help but sigh, knowing
we're heading to its headquarters.  
"Hey, what kind of country is this "Grand Duchy of Gaudre"?"  
Perhaps as bored as I was, Jesha brought that up, and Feld, who was next
to her and equally bored, spoke as if recalling knowledge befitting a
former noble.  
"Well... it's a nation with a small territory but many artisans."  
  
To summarize his story, it's next to the Fandora Theocracy, so it gives
the impression of a nation that has survived without being absorbed by a
larger country.  
Its territory and population are less than a tenth of the large Kingdom
of Claydale, but even during the era when Claydale merged with Melrose
and Dandorl, Gaudre wasn't targeted by Claydale or the nearby Kingdom of
Cel'Les because it supplied specialty products to the Holy Nation.  
Livestock and agriculture. Carpets made from high-quality wool and
fragrant fruit wine made from high-quality grapes are treated as
top-grade products used in Holy Church rituals.  
In other words, this country survived precisely because the Holy Church
was reluctant to see its artisans disappear if it went to war with other
nations.  
  
The Holy Church has enough "power" to restrain the movements of nations.
That means it has a large number of believers, but the larger the
maximum number, the larger both the good and the bad become.  
It's a rough analogy, but if there are only a hundred people, the range
of good and evil is only a hundred. But if there are a thousand, that
range also becomes a thousand.  
Even if the Holy Church has many pure-hearted believers and priests, it
also harbors as much darkness as its purity.  
...Which side is the Hero-sama on, I wonder? I'm looking forward to
it.  
  
We have no particular business in the Grand Duchy of Gaudre, so we'll
mostly pass straight through. All we'll do is enjoy the local specialty
fruit wine and grilled lamb ribs from a stall, I suppose.  
If you head north for about three weeks, you'll reach the capital, from
there, heading west leads to the Kingdom of Cel'Les, and northeast leads
to the Fandora Theocracy, so this country is also a trade hub for three
nations, including Claydale.  
Therefore, no matter how idyllic the country, if the flow of people
increases, scoundrels will appear to prey on its simplicity.  
  
"Dalton, bandits."  
On the way from the capital to the Holy Nation, Miranda, who was
driving, stopped the carriage and called out from the small window.  
"Go deal with them, you young ones."  
Dalton said that without even lifting his hips from the seat, and I
stopped Jesha and Alia, who were about to move.  
"I'll go. I'm bored."  
At my smiling face, Alia sighed and sat back down, but Jesha showed her
displeasure.  
"I'm bored too, you know?"  
"Oh, are you coming along? But if I accidentally kill them, I'm
sorry."  
When I said that without a hint of remorse, Jesha made a face like she'd
bitten into a bitter bug and glared at Alia.  
"Alia..."  
"Give up."  
I'm glad you understand! ♪  
  
"Snow's going out?"  
When I stepped out of the carriage alone, Miranda, who was holding her
bow and scanning the surroundings, looked slightly taken aback.  
"Don't burn the forest, okay?"  
"It rarely burns with lightning, so it's fine."  
...Probably.  
I concentrated a little and searched for enemies, and indeed, I felt a
presence that seemed to be them.  
Mira judged them to be "bandits." But...  
"There's something "strange" out there."  
"Eh..."  
At my murmur, Mira furrowed her brow and searched for the "presence"
further away, and perhaps she also caught a strange existence, as her
expression changed slightly.  
"They're decreasing..."  
  
Yes... The presence that seemed to be "bandits" that I first detected
suddenly began to decrease.  
Faint screams could be heard from afar.  
"Oh my..."  
This might be entertaining.

Is the appearing entity friend or foe?  
What Snow saw there was...
