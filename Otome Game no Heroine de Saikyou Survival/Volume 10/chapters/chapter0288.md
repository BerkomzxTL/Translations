## 288 A Sly Person

"...Understood."  
That voice flowed out, and in the room, which was silent for a moment as
no one understood its meaning, I, who was the first to realize its
implication, involuntarily let out a sound.  
"What are you saying, Alia?"  
  
A moment later, those who realized the speaker was Alia began to stir,
and amidst them, Feld raised his voice in accusation.  
"Alia, you...!"  
"Oh, then it's settled, Alia-san. I'm glad you understand."  
Before Feld could continue, Hero Klein interrupted him, deciding it was
an "acceptance."  
"Then, for the details―"  
"―However."  
This time, Alia interrupted Klein, who was about to continue.  
"Elemental dragons have wills. We'll confirm its will first."  
"Hoh..."  
Klein smiled faintly at Alia's words.  
  
Indeed, dealing with an elemental dragon is different from simply
exterminating rampaging monsters...  
Adventurers fight monsters for materials, for their livelihood, to
live... in a broad sense, it's "survival of the fittest."  
They defeat them because they're in the way of living. They defeat them
because they need their meat. They defeat them because they were
attacked. They kill because it's necessary, not because they want to
kill.  
The Fire Dragon merely exterminated pests that encroached upon its
territory.  
On this continent, they've coexisted for over a thousand years. If
someone or some nation desires that land and claims the Fire Dragon is
in the way, and they fight, there's no justice in it; it's just a
quarrel between neighbors. Which means...  
"...Is that alright?"  
All eyes turned to me as I spoke again.  
"The Fire Dragon being in the way is Kingdom of Zentore's convenience,
isn't it? Surely the Holy Church's Hero-sama isn't going to fight for
the benefit of one country? Is that alright? So..."  
  
―The Hero's existence is cheap―  
  
My interjection was directed at Temple Knight Captain Vincent at the
end.  
Vincent, understanding the implication, loudly clicked his heels
together before the Hero or Cardinal could speak.  
"Of course! A Hero would never act for the benefit of a single
nation!"  
  
At those words, the Cardinal remained silent in confusion, and the Hero
looked at Vincent and me.  
"I see. Is that your opinion? If the Fire Dragon were to attack a human
city because of that, who would take responsibility?"  
"Such a thing..."  
Vincent was confused by the sudden talk of responsibility.  
"They might be attacked. The Hero is here right now. Isn't it necessary
for the people?"  
Just as Vincent began to be pushed back by that argument...  
"That's why I said we'd confirm the Fire Dragon's will."  
Alia interjected again. Everyone's gaze returned to Alia, and Klein
shrugged as if to say, "Oh, for goodness sake."  
"If, as a result, we let it go and it attacks later, will you take
responsibility?"  
"If, as a result of fighting, the Fire Dragon attacks the city, will you
take responsibility?"  
"If we defeat it, the problem will be solved."  
"Then will the Holy Church guarantee that the Hero will definitely win?
If there's damage, will the Holy Church take responsibility?"  
"That is, of course―"  
"―What nonsense is this!"  
Only when the conversation turned into a matter of the Holy Church's
responsibility did the Cardinal, who had almost faded into the
background, raise his voice.  
  
"This responsibility issue is just a pointless argument! Klein! Go and
confirm the will of that person and the Fire Dragon! Vincent! You go
with them too!"  
Klein shrugged at the Cardinal's furious outburst, which looked like his
veins might pop.  
"Oh dear, it can't be helped. I only wanted to know the young ladies'
abilities, but confirming the Fire Dragon's will is more troublesome
than defeating it, you know?"  
Klein complained with his usual sarcastic tone. Since he's being like
that, should I interject too?  
"You are the Hero, aren't you? Or perhaps I'm mistaken?"  
If you're the Hero, you should be able to do at least that much, I said,
provoking him. Klein then gave an unpleasant smile and bowed like a
noble with an obsequious attitude.  
"I hope you will also show me your power, my lovely young lady."  
  
The meeting ended there. Putting aside the talk of Alia becoming his
companion, we somehow ended up going to subjugate the Fire Dragon.  
Confirming the dragon's will is fine, but why did Alia specifically
agree to it? Well, I can guess why.  
  
"Alia... are you there?"  
"Snow?"  
That night, when I went to Alia's private room assigned by the Holy
Church, she stopped maintaining her weapons and looked up.  
"Still so ascetic, aren't you? Mira was so angry she couldn't calm down,
she invited Jesha and went drinking in town, you know?"  
I entered the room without permission and sat across from Alia, who was
working at the table.  
"Why are you going along with his nonsense?"  
  
There's no need to go along with such nonsense. Even if he is the Hero,
he can't be easily killed, either physically or politically, but
couldn't Alia assassinate him?  
  
"It would cause trouble for Elena."  
"I thought so."  
For me, Alia is someone I'd risk my life for, but for them, they're
friends, aren't they?  
I sighed in exasperation at Alia's words, and Alia smiled faintly,
pouring water into a cup from the pitcher provided.  
I chilled the two offered cups with cold air and pushed one back to
Alia.  
"Elena would say not to worry about it. But it's not wise to make the
Holy Church lose face."  
"That's true."  
  
The Holy Church owes the Kingdom of Claydale a favor because of that
fake and the demon incident.  
My question was that I thought Elena could refuse without making the
relationship with the Holy Church too bad.  
However, the Holy Church also has its pride. And there are factions
within the Holy Church.  
The Holy Church on this continent is based on the Holy Church from
another continent. This Holy Church cannot refuse a request from a Hero
dispatched from there, and that Cardinal, perhaps because he has ties to
the other Holy Church, can speak up to the Hero, but he won't show
consideration for the Kingdom of Claydale.  
But more than that...  
"Does she think that Hero would directly harm Elena?"  
"...It's not impossible."  
  
He's truly troublesome... It seems that Hero doesn't care about this
continent at all.  
If he acts as he pleases and causes problems, he can just go back, and
he might hurt someone out of spite. ...Is this how the opposing factions
felt when Alia was working behind the scenes? Well, the Hero is even
worse.  
  
"I've encountered people with that kind of mental structure before. I
intend to assess him with this Fire Dragon matter. After that, I'll get
Elena's permission and change our approach."  
"...It can't be helped."  
I sighed softly again and drained the cold water from my cup.  
"Is it okay to cause trouble for me?"  
When I said something a little mean as a retort, Alia looked bewildered,
then smiled faintly.  
"Isn't it too late for that?"  
  
Yes, truly... Alia is sly.
