## 289 Things We Encounter

A few days after the meeting with Hero Klein, we set off from Holy City
Faan in the Fandora Theocracy, heading towards the Kingdom of Zentore,
where the Fire Dragon was causing trouble.  
...We've come quite a long way, haven't we? I'm getting tired of it, as
expected.  
We entered the Kingdom of Yahn, which is on the way from the Holy
Nation, but if it were just a normal trip, I'd want to go straight east.
The Kingdom of Yahn is a country with thriving fisheries, and dishes
using shark fins are apparently famous. But we're heading north without
even stopping at the capital, aren't we...?  
  
The Kingdom of Zentore. It's a land surrounded by rocky terrain,
wetlands, and monster habitats, constantly exposed to the threat of
monsters, and apparently, a country where local lords have always fought
over fertile land.  
I can't say it's because of that, but there are many hot-headed
warriors, and they reached out to the "Dragon Hunting Grounds" in search
of fertile grasslands... Well, you can guess what happened.  
  
Since it was their own fault, neighboring countries were reluctant to
cooperate even when asked, and only the Kingdom of Zentore would benefit
if they lent a hand, so no one responded to their pleas. But this time,
it seems the Hero took advantage of that situation.  
  
"We'll enter the Kingdom of Zentore in a few days. There will be more
monsters, so everyone be vigilant."  
Dalton, sitting heavily in the innermost seat of the carriage, warned
them with his arms crossed. Indeed, I feel like the presence of monsters
has gradually increased over the past few days.  
However, besides us, over a dozen of Temple Knight Vincent's knights are
accompanying us on horseback and in carriages, so ordinary monsters are
easily dealt with. And besides...  
  
―Knock, knock.  
"Monsters... it seems *they're* coming out."  
Jesha, who was driving, informed us through the small window.  
Even without Vincent needing to act, ordinary monsters wouldn't even
approach, fearing the "Hero's" presence. More intelligent monsters tend
to do so. However, if monsters still attack despite that, they must be
either incredibly stupid monsters or Undead... or monsters extremely
confident in their own strength.  
"I'll go take a look."  
"I'll go too."  
I followed Alia as she stood up. Alia glanced back at Feld for a moment.
She seemed to wonder if he, as a swordsman, wouldn't want to see, but
Feld shook his head.  
"If too many go, they'll be wary. Besides, if it's just to watch, you
can see from the carriage."  
"...Understood."  
Indeed, if it's just the two of us, the opponents might show their true
strength... in various ways.  
  
"They"―the people Jesha called that, weren't referring to the Hero.  
Hero Klein was included, but "they" were the members of the Hero's
party, introduced casually before departure. But... he brought
companions, didn't he? I thought he was alone since he acted on his own
and negotiated on his own.  
"Is that it...?"  
"It seems so."  
  
What appeared, breaking trees along the roadside with cracking sounds,
was a Troll.  
A single one is Rank 4. It can even be Rank 5 in the Adventurer's Guild
difficulty rankings. It's a monster with low intelligence, simply huge
and strong, but its greatest threat was its regeneration ability.  
It's not regenerating with magic like vampires or Undead; it's
troublesome because its constitution makes it hard to kill.  
Thick, viscous fat obstructs blades, and that fat instantly closes
wounds. Perhaps due to its low intelligence, it doesn't retreat from
pain; instead, it becomes enraged and attacks.  
I could freeze it and shatter it, and Alia could dodge all its attacks
and stab it in the brain, but for Ranks 2 or 3, there's almost nothing
they can do.  
There weren't just one, but three such troublesome enemies.  
  
***"UGOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
A Troll nearly twice our height swung a club almost like a log. A man
stepped forward, stopping Temple Knight Vincent who tried to confront
such an opponent.  
"Sir Douglas!"  
"Leave it to me."  
GAAANG!!  
A fully plated warrior with a greatshield blocked a club strike, and a
broad-bladed longsword swung with one hand cut the club in half.  
  
【Douglas】【Race: Human ♂】【Rank 6】  
【Magic Power: 252/270】【Health: 423/455】  
【Overall Combat Power: 2410 (Body Enhancement: 3110)】  
【Special Abilities: Unknown】  
  
Douglas perfectly blocked the Troll's attacks, and each subsequent slash
cut through the Troll's thick fat, causing blood to gush out.  
***"UGAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
Even so, the Troll didn't flinch, and the other two also attacked
Douglas.  
Then―  
"―Hmph."  
A swordsman with a single-edged bastard sword leaped in, cutting off
both of the Troll's arms along with the raised club.  
"Neidhardt..."  
"Why are you struggling with such an opponent, Douglas?"  
  
【Neidhardt】【Race: Human ♂】【Rank 6】  
【Magic Power: 256/280】【Health: 403/415】  
【Overall Combat Power: 2630 (Body Enhancement: 3417)】  
【Special Abilities: Unknown】  
  
"Those are the Hero's companions..."  
Alia muttered quietly, narrowing her eyes sharply as if assessing
them.  
Douglas, a large heavy warrior in his early thirties with short brown
hair.  
Neidhardt, a nervous-looking swordsman in his late twenties with long
silver hair.  
Both are estimated to be Rank 6... Their combat power isn't such that
they couldn't be defeated if we were serious, but as companions of the
Hero and "champion-class" recognized by spirits, they surely have a
"secret weapon."  
Just like me and Alia...  
  
***"Gugoooh..."***  
...Thud. The last Troll fell with a tremor.  
Douglas defended, and Neidhardt annihilated. With just that, they safely
defeated three Rank 5 monsters.  
...How troublesome. Can I kill them in my current state?  
At my faintly leaked killing intent, Douglas and Neidhardt glanced at
me, then quickly looked away. Seeing this, Hero Klein, who had been
watching like us, looked at me for a moment, then shrugged and gave a
meaningful smile.  
"...I see."  
"Snow?"  
Indeed, with this, I can understand why he wants Alia.  
"No, it's nothing silly."  
Because three men would be stifling.  
  
The battle with the suddenly appearing Trolls ended with only the Hero's
companions, without us needing to intervene.  
The general Temple Knights and their squires, witnessing the strength of
the Heroes recognized by the Holy Church, were excited, and a relaxed
atmosphere flowed through the area.  
At that moment―  
  
―...GOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!  
  
A roaring sound of cutting wind echoed, and a huge bird-like shadow flew
over our heads... at a low altitude, about the height of a castle, and
flew away without a moment's pause.  
The air vibrated. A moment later, the horses neighed in fear from the
raging storm.  
...Amidst it all, I continued to stare, without blinking, at that
beautiful, fiery red figure flying away.  
That was...  
"...The Fire Elemental Dragon..."
