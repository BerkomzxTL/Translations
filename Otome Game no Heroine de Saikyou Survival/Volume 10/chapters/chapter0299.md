## 299 The Hero's Power

"―GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!"  
  
Hero Klein, struck by the massive lightning bolt falling from the sky
unleashed by Snow, let out a cry of agony like a death rattle.  
As he tried to resist the lightning, talismans on Klein's body,
seemingly for anti-magic, burst apart as if to cancel out the
lightning.  
All talismans lost their effect, and Klein's entire body was enveloped
in the light of the spirit's blessing, but the lightning magic,
equivalent to Rank 7, finally pierced through the blessing of light,
burning through Klein's entire body.  
  
"――!"  
As the lightning scattered, Klein, scorched black, exhaled black smoke
from his mouth and collapsed―  
"Not yet!"  
With Alia's shout, Klein's feet, which had been about to collapse,
stomped on the ground.  
"...You bastards! I won't forgive youuuuuuuuuuu!!"  
  
His burnt skin peeled away, and with a roar of anger, new skin
regenerated in an instant, even his hair growing back.  
This was the blessing of light. This was the Hero. The power of a chosen
hero to counter Demon Lord-class threats to the world.  
As everyone was momentarily stunned by its sheer absurdity, Snow, who
moved first, began to gather mana to deliver the finishing blow,
but...  
"―*Cough*"  
She coughed from the sudden overload of mana, stainingher mouth with
blood.  
  
"―【Iron Rose】... 【Rejected World】―!!"  
  
In her place, Alia used 【Iron Rose】 and lunged at Klein, who was still
off balance.  
  
【Alia (Alicia)】【Race: Human ♀】【Rank 6】  
【Magic Power: 141/420】【Health: 238/320】  
【Total Combat Power: 3356 (During Special Body Enhancement: 6649)】  
【Combat Skill: Iron Rose【Iron Rose】 /Limit 282 Second】  
【Illusion Magic: Rejected World―《Silver》】  
  
Alia burst forth with strong combat power and a silver light.  
With her mana depleted, the time limit was near. But with Alia's skill,
she should be able to deliver the finishing blow to Klein now.  
  
*BOOOOM*!  
Alia, who had leaped out with a stomp that made the ground explode,
swung her black dagger.  
"GUOOOOOOOH!"  
With a *Clang*!, Klein's magic sword, which he hadn't let go of even
after being struck by lightning, blocked Alia's attack, scattering
intense magical sparks.  
Even if Klein's wounds appeared healed on the surface, he was near death
from continuously taking Alia's and Snow's attacks. No matter how much
the blessing of light healed him, the damage remaining deep within his
body wouldn't heal easily, and Klein's limbs trembled from their
attacks, with copious amounts of cold sweat pouring from his face.  
But she couldn't push through. Alia's eyes stared sharply at *it*.  
"...That "magic sword" is in the way."  
  
It was probably a dungeon-produced magic sword, not a man-made one like
a Dark Dragon material weapon.  
Dungeon-produced magic swords, perhaps because they are created by
non-humans for "humans," are often unsuitable for human use. However,
very rarely, a true "magic sword" that humans could never create appears
among them.  
These, made of high-purity mithril with a monster's magic stone
incorporated alive, were called "Holy Swords" or "Divine Swords," and
usually, high-ranking adventurers who found them would either use them
themselves or present them to kings or powerful figures in pursuit of
honor.  
One such sword was likely presented to the Holy Church and became the
weapon wielded by the Hero.  
As long as that "magic sword" existed, protecting the Hero as if it had
a will of its own, it would be difficult to deliver the finishing blow
to Klein.  
A sword that protects Klein like a companion, even though he would cut
down his own companions... For a Hero who fights not for "humans" but
for the world, it might, in a sense, be a fitting "companion."  
But...  
Snow roughly wiped the blood from her mouth, looking at it with cold
eyes.  
"You're not the only one with companions who protect you."  
  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
At that moment, a shadow, still severely wounded yet gathering strength
and waiting for an opportunity, swept through like a gale, tearing off
Klein's left arm, which had been focused on Alia.  
"GUAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!"  
Fresh blood splattered, and Klein screamed, leaping back to create
distance from his adversaries for the first time.  
No matter how strong the blessing of light, a torn-off arm wouldn't heal
during combat. And then―  
  
***"GAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!"***  
The Fire Dragon, which had been lying on the ground near death, but was
still clinging to life, seized this opportunity to unleash its Dragon's
Breath, and flames enveloped Klein.  
"...You, you weaklingssss!!"  
Although healed once again by the blessing of light, Klein, utterly
battered both inside and out, fled from the flames.  
Experiencing a life-threatening crisis for the first time. The fact that
he was cornered caused a look of desperation to appear on Klein's face,
and he roared at the heavens as if venting his anger.  
  
"Light Spirit!! Are you trying to kill me?! Did you lie?! Give me power!
Give me all your power!!"  
  
Words of anger and resentment towards the Light Spirit who chose him as
a Hero. A human might despise him for such words, but a spirit, with a
different logic than humans, grants the Hero power to destroy enemies as
they wish.  
Light poured from the sky, and in a majestic scene, Klein, receiving it,
cried out loudly.  
"Not yet! More! Don't hold back!!"  
The "fear" that the Hero, who had only pursued boredom and pleasure,
felt for the first time, made him greedily demand "power" without
limit.  
Further light poured down on Klein, and within the pillar of light,
light mana spread out like wings.  
  
"Hahaha! This is it! With this, I'm invincible!!"  
An enormous amount of mana, surpassing Snow's, erupted and raged from
Klein's entire body.  
The spirit's blessing didn't grant new power from scratch, but rather,
to counter threats, it gave the Hero complete power, ready for immediate
combat.  
"―【All Cure】―!!"  
Klein used light magic. Alia's eyes widened when she realized it was a
Rank 6 spell, and Snow's eyes, with dark circles under them, narrowed
into a glare.  
Healing magic couldn't erase the damage remaining deep within the body.
But the power of All Cure and the blessing of light were trying to
regenerate even Klein's torn-off arm.  
  
"―【Chase Lightning】―"  
Snow, who had surged an enormous amount of mana from her thorns to
prevent that, unleashed multiple lightning bolts from both hands, and
several times the usual number of lightning bolts, forced by her mana,
attacked Klein.  
But―  
"―【Teleport】―!!"  
His form was enveloped in darkness, and countless lightning bolts cut
through the air. The vanished Klein kicked Snow from behind.  
"Hk!"  
"Snow!"  
Alia lunged at Snow, who was sent flying even after instinctively
guarding with thorns, but Klein grinned and pointed his magic sword, and
regenerated left arm, at her.  
"―【Ice Storm】―"  
Two blizzards were unleashed, attacking Alia and Snow.  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"***  
***"――!!!"***  
Nero intervened and shielded Alia, and the Fire Dragon spread its wings
to protect Snow.  
The Fire Dragon's wings froze, and the moment Nero was blown away along
with Alia, the Dark Dragon's fang knife that Alia had dropped floated up
as if summoned, releasing mana with a roar to mitigate the attack's
force.  
  
"Hahaha! You weaklings, combining your strength to resist the Hero!
Behold, this is my power! With this power, I will never be defeated!
Ahahahahahahahahaha――... huh?"  
  
＊＊＊  
  
"Nero... 【High Heal】―"  
***"Gah..."***  
Klein, who had been laughing loudly, covered his mouth, and I
deactivated "Iron Rose" and used healing magic on Nero, who had
protected me.  
Nero can't move anymore. But I don't need a lot of mana anymore
either.  
  
"What is this... *cough*"  
Klein coughed, spitting out blood as if all the accumulated damage had
suddenly caught up to him.  
Of course. Unlike dungeon spirits, the Light Spirit had given the "Hero"
complete, unbound power so he could fight for a long time. Magical
power, swordsmanship, martial arts... truly, it must be the "power"
necessary to save the world.  
But power without accumulation lacks depth, and that became our
opening.  
That's why you sought even greater power.  
You sought not stable power, where the spirit sacrifices itself to bear
the cost, but limitless power to deliver the finishing blow to enemies
like a Demon Lord.  
Even a Hero is a living creature that breathes and dies without water.
Even if wounds heal, they are creatures of this world that bleed when
injured, unlike spiritual lifeforms like spirits.  
Complete magic of all attributes...  
Its biological cost could not be borne by the spirit... and the "magic
stone" that formed in his heart would never heal.  
  
"Do you have the same resolve as Snow?"  
  
Do you have the resolve to accept pain and death and live on?  
I picked up the black knife that had protected me, stroked the knife
that resisted as if protesting being used as a decoy, and held it ready
along with the black dagger.  
If I'm going to finish Klein off, it has to be now. But I don't have the
power for a one-hit kill.  
So what do I do?  
If I don't have it, I'll just learn it here.  
"Lend me your strength."  
At my voice, the black knife and dagger trembled.  
  
This "technique" was unknown even to the Adventurer's Guild and Dalton,
who had been an adventurer for a hundred years. I only heard about it
from Elena, who saw it in a picture book she had read long ago in the
royal library.  
Why was there a picture book in the royal library?  
I understand now. Like Snow, who sought destruction, it wasn't about
searching for what to gain, but about someone in the royal family
recalling it for when it would be needed someday.  
A story from long, long ago. For the Hero challenging the Demon Lord,
the hero transformed their first learned technique into the strongest
blow, cutting a path to the enemy.  
Therefore, that technique has no fixed form or name.  
Because it exists only within me.  
  
"What is this... Spirit! You lied to me! You said I could do whatever I
wanted as long as I protected the world! How can I do whatever I want in
this body!!"  
  
Klein roared like a child throwing a tantrum.  
Is that your true nature...? What the Hero saves is the world, and the
world where humans live is only a part of it. That's why the Hero had to
be *that* kind of person.  
If the reason the Hero came to this continent was the Dark Dragon, then
he's no longer needed.  
Even if there's some new threat, I will resist as a "human."  
So―  
  
"You should have just died!"  
Klein, spitting blood, glared at me with heavily shadowed eyes as I held
my weapons, and raised his magic sword.  
"―【Conqueror】―!!!"  
Probably a Rank 6 one-handed sword combat skill. Mana, blessed by light,
gathered in the sword, bursting forth as a flash of light.  
"You're pathetic, just die already."  
I pointed the dagger in my left hand straight at Klein, gathered refined
non-attribute mana in both arms, and as I leaped out, I used the black
dagger I had pulled close as a launchpad, thrusting it like an "Iai"
draw.  
  
"―【Dragon Fang Strike】―!!"  
  
My unique Rank 6 combat skill, based on 【Thrust】, the Rank 1 combat
skill I first learned and used the most.  
The black flash, dyed by the two Dark Dragon weapons that lent me their
power, and Klein's white flash intersected, and as we rushed past each
other and turned our backs, blood spurted from my shoulder.  
"―!"  
*CRACK*!!  
At that moment, Klein's magic sword, which had taken our attacks
countless times, shattered, and fresh blood spurted from his neck.  
Carelessness, arrogance, borrowed power...  
  
"Your defeat... is because you are a "Hero.""  
  
Klein looked back with an expression of disbelief, slowly collapsing.  
As I raised my black dagger to deliver the finishing blow, at that
moment―  
―*Thud*.  
Suddenly, his chest swelled, and a delicate, blood-stained hand covered
in black thorns pierced through from his back, grabbing his heart.  
Crushing his heart with her bare hand, Snow emerged from behind the
lifeless Klein, a sickly smile on her face, her eyes shadowed with dark
circles.  
  
"I'm sorry, Alia. I can't let anyone but me deliver the finishing
blow."
