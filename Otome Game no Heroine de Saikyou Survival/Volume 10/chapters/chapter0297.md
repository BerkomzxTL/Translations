## 297 Naivety and Resolve

"...【Soul Thorn】..."  
  
The moment I uttered that "activation word," I felt a black flame surge
within me.  
That black flame, like "thorns," entwined itself around my pale,
bloodless skin, and the inner fire began to overflow as mana.  
  
【Karla Leicester】【Race: Human ♀】【Rank 6】  
【Magic Power: ∞/660】20Up【Health: 17/48】  
【Total Combat Power: 2376 (Special Combat Power: 6472)】  
【Gift: Soul Thorn, Exchange/Life Time】  
  
"Snow!!"  
Alia's pained voice echoed. Is she angry? She must be angry.  
If I defeat this guy and I'm still alive, she can be as angry as she
wants... so, let me kill this guy!  
  
"―【Chase Lightning】―"  
Lightning, boosted by infinite mana, attacked Klein with far greater
force than before.  
  
"Ahahahahahahahahaha! What is that! Is that your true power?!"  
Klein let out a booming laugh at the swarm of lightning chasing its
prey, and his magic sword in hand intercepted it.  
"―【Vorpal Blade】―!"  
A Rank 5 one-handed sword combat skill. All the lightning was struck
down by this skill, which unleashed multiple slashes in an instant,
scattering dazzling sparks.  
Combat skills of Rank 5 or higher boast a level of power and range
superior to those of Rank 4 or lower. It was said that these were not
combat skills created by humans, but rather by spirits for "Heroes" and
their companions to fight against great enemies.  
But you know...  
"The post-use rigidity hasn't changed, has it?"  
  
*Thud*!!  
"Ngh!"  
In that instant... my kick, delivered as I closed in during that brief
moment, sent Klein flying and shattered the bones in his left arm.  
Perhaps because it was a combat skill created for Heroes, the rigidity
time is short, and its reuse is also shortened. But the "black thorns"
wrapped around my body forcibly manipulated my body according to my
will, granting me enough physical ability and strength to respond to
that fleeting moment.  
Even so, my right leg broke from the power exceeding its limits, but I'm
used to pain, you know?  
"―【Freeze】―"  
  
"―Tch!"  
Klein, recovering from his cooldown, swept away the freezing air with
the magic sword in his right hand. But the Rank 6 ice magic, imbued with
ample mana, froze half of Klein's body without losing its potency even
after being swept away.  
"Damn it!!"  
Klein cried out, shattering the ice that had frozen only a thin layer of
his skin from the inside.  
  
*Thwack*!!  
At that moment, I leaped in again and punched Klein's right cheek with
my left fist.  
Klein's cheekbone and my fist's bones shattered simultaneously, and we
were both repelled with a sound like giant rocks colliding.  
Aiming for that moment, I pointed my fingertips at Klein. But Klein
grabbed the hem of my skirt with his broken left hand, pulling me closer
as he tore it.  
"It's over!"  
Klein's magic sword swung. I moved even closer without dodging, blocking
it with my thorn-wrapped arm.  
*Clang*!!  
The thorns, which had even blocked Alia's knife, were sliced open, and
the blade sank halfway into my arm.  
"HAAAAAHHH!!"  
At that instant, I unleashed mana from my entire body.  
Infinite mana pushed back the magic sword, and my hair, which had been
black, became even darker as if absorbing mana, as we clashed magic at
such close range that our faces were reflected in each other's eyes.  
  
*BOOM*!!!  
With a sound like the air exploding, this time we were both sent flying
a considerable distance.  
"...Fuhahahahaha! Your power may have increased, but it's still just
"Heroic-class"! It seems it wasn't enough to kill me, a "Hero"!"  
Klein, who had landed some distance away, pointed the tip of his magic
sword at me and let out a booming laugh.  
As light enveloped Klein's entire body, his broken left arm and swollen,
shattered cheek healed instantly, returning to normal.  
"...I know... That much."  
I replied, and then, using 【All Cure】 without incantation, I instantly
healed my broken bones and lacerations, causing Klein to visibly
wince.  
  
I can fight well. Still, my disadvantage hasn't changed.  
My combat power exceeded 6000, and the gap in strength narrowed, but as
long as Klein has the blessing of the Light Spirit, I can't inflict
significant damage.  
I still can't use Rank 8 magic. Rank 7 magic might involve Alia and
kitty-chan, and besides, I don't think Klein would allow me the time to
cast such a grand spell.  
"...*Cough*."  
Still, what I have to do hasn't changed.  
I coughed lightly, spitting out the blood that had risen, and then, with
my blackened hair flowing, I further increased my mana.  
...Notice it, Alia.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
―Alia POV  
  
"Snow!!"  
That girl used her 【Gift】.  
I felt anger at that. More than Snow carelessly throwing away her life,
I was angry at myself for letting it happen.  
It was my own "naivety" that allowed it. I gained power and became
strong. And at the same time, I, who had lost everything, gained
something precious.  
People I was indebted to. Trustworthy companions. A kind family.
Precious friends...  
  
Black thorns wrapped around Snow's entire body like a tattoo, and an
enormous amount of mana erupted, her life as its price.  
With that power, her combat strength, now Rank 6, exceeded 6000.  
Even so, it's reckless. Snow bravely attacked, but she was only able to
inflict damage by sacrificing herself in a mutual strike. As a magic
user, perhaps that's her only option for fighting alone, but the
blessing of the Light Spirit heals even that.  
Snow's hair, turning black as it absorbed her mana, looked as if her
life was being drained away.  
"Kuh!"  
Pain shot through my entire body as I tried to stand. Yet, I felt as if
Snow looked at me for a moment as I forced myself up.  
  
"HAAAAAAAAAAH!!"  
I stood up with a roar, and then, as if to interrupt their fight, I
slashed at Klein with my black knife.  
*Clang*!!  
"Hahaha! Still resisting, are we! Come at me all at once! I'll fucking
kill you all!"  
Klein swung his magic sword horizontally, easily sending me flying as I
blocked it with my two weapons.  
Klein and I are both light warriors with one-handed weapons. The
difference in combat power and stats directly translates to a difference
in fighting strength. How can I bridge that gap...?  
  
"―【Paralyze】―"  
At that moment, Klein's movements stopped for an instant due to the
paralysis effect. Seizing that opportunity, I burst forward, emitting
light particles from my entire body, and aimed for his eye with my black
dagger.  
"Tch!"  
But Klein, once again enveloped in light, dispelled the paralysis, and
the dagger's strike only shallowly cut his eyelid.  
*Thud*!  
At that moment, a kick swung from the side shattered Klein's shoulder,
and Snow's leg also broke.  
"AAAAAAAHHH!! You're in the way, you bastard!"  
  
My attacks were dodged, but Snow's attacks landed. Why?  
Even with the black thorns enhancing her, Snow's speed doesn't surpass
mine when I use "Iron Rose." So what's the reason?  
Snow looked at me for a moment while fighting. What did that mean?  
...I'm sorry, Snow.  
I won't hesitate anymore.  
  
"...Hah!"  
I charged at Klein again. The moment he noticed and unleashed a kick, I
threw my black knife at him.  
"Guhgah!?"  
As Klein's attention was momentarily diverted to the dagger, I leaped
in, my palm strike connecting with his jaw as my side was cut.  
  
Because I was soft, Snow had no choice but to sacrifice her life.  
I hesitated to cause trouble for the people important to me—my
companions... my family... Elena... by killing the "Hero."  
But that didn't matter.  
If I let this guy live, he would bring disaster to all of them.  
If the people important to me get into trouble, then I should just
die.  
Snow risked her own life in my place, for me who had forgotten my
resolve to die.  
I won't hesitate anymore...  
Snow reminded me how to fight.  
  
"Youuuu!!"  
Klein roared, seemingly unharmed, as I flashed the black dagger at him,
using it as a decoy. My kick, delivered as I stepped in, caught Klein's
jaw.  
This probably didn't do much damage either. But that's fine.  
"You die here."  
  
With the resolve in my words, a blade-like "killing intent" erupted from
my entire body.  
At that moment, I felt something change within me, something that had
been stagnant until now.  
  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time, I also included Alia's perspective.  
  
The next book, Volume 10, has more than half of it written from scratch,
including not only Snow's perspective but also Alia's!  
It's not finished yet, though lol
