## 272 The Role of a Magician

《―..A trade? What art thou speaking of―》  
  
In the spirit world... at my words, the young spirit made a puzzled
face.  
  
《―Dost thou say thou wilt give to me? Without such a thing, "humans"
need only wish. I shall grant but one wish―》  
  
"That may be so for a great spirit. However, my wish is a grand one.
Though it is but a single wish, it is so grand that I feel quite
apologetic."  
When I said that and smiled, the spirit nodded quietly.  
  
《―Indeed, in the past, there were "humans" who made greedy wishes. But
I have granted those wishes too. To the child who wished to obtain
everything of a certain girl, I granted the opportunity to contract with
a spiritual life form that grants various wishes―》  
  
To this spirit, mediating between humans and demons was just that
trivial, huh?  
"I wish to consolidate several magic attributes. However, I don't want
to trouble you with something so bothersome. So, would you hear my
thoughts?"  
  
《―That much is no trouble at all. All attributes shall be consolidated
into the "Chaos" attribute―》  
  
"There's no need for that."  
I cut off the spirit's words before it could finish. If it finished, it
might become fixed.  
Besides, the Chaos attribute? Wouldn't that turn me into a demon? I'm a
little curious, but it probably wouldn't lead to anything good. I'd
probably be turned into some ugly imp.  
"I want the attributes other than Light and Dark to be consolidated into
two: "Lightning" and "Ice.""  
When I stated my wish, the spirit furrowed its brow slightly.  
  
《―That is indeed greedy. Thou art speaking of two wishes. That cannot
be―》  
  
"But if you mix too much, it will become chaos. And if it's only
"Lightning," then "Earth" will be left over."  
  
《―Even so, the attributes would be consolidated into two. What more
dost thou seek―》  
  
"My wish is to consolidate them. If I do that, I'll have to discard
"Earth." Is it greedy to wish for something for myself, who would be
discarding a precious attribute?"  
...It's probably greedy.  
If I discarded "Light" and "Dark," I could probably negotiate more
easily, but without those two, I can't maintain my sickly body. I
considered strengthening those two, but I couldn't combine Light and
Dark like Alia.  
"Light" and "Dark" are Alia's powers, so I won't wish for them.  
  
《―In that case, in return, I shall grant thee the "Fire" thou didst
seal in the past. Though that which was once sealed must be trained anew
from the beginning, it is a fitting exchange―》  
  
To the offer of returning a useless attribute that would only put
pressure on my heart, I smiled back.  
"In that case, if you add that "Fire," wouldn't it neatly become two
attributes?"  
  
《―But even then, it is two wishes. That cannot be helped―》  
  
"No. I would lose "Earth" and also lose the new "Fire," wouldn't I?"  
I earnestly spun this lie as if it were the truth.  
But there shouldn't be a problem, right? The rules are all up to you.  
"This trade isn't about me offering you something. It's a "trade" to
grant a single wish: that I desire your mercy for what I would lose."  
  
＊＊＊  
  
"―【Paralyze】―"  
  
Level 5 Lightning Magic's Paralyze struck the Chimera. As expected, it's
impossible to stop everything when it's this big.  
If I had only chosen the Lightning attribute, I might have been able to
strengthen it a bit more, but then I might have received something
unnecessary again and shortened my life.  
But even a momentary stop is enough.  
"―【Ice Whip】―"  
The Ice Whip, like thorns, entangled the still-moving parts and pinned
them to the floor.  
"―【Ice Storm】―"  
  
The Ice Storm, used with dual casting, expanded its range and enveloped
the gigantic Chimera, freezing its entire body in an instant.  
But―  
  
CRACK!!  
***"―GIIIGAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
Ignoring its paralyzed and frozen surface, the Chimera generated
countless arms from within, shattering the ice.  
Rank 7... truly a monster. How did Alia and kitty-chan defeat the Dark
Dragon?  
But that's fine.  
"Alia!!"  
I'm not alone anymore.  
  
"HAAAAAAAHHHH!!"  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
Alia and kitty-chan, who had been trusting me and gathering their
strength, leaped out from left and right, launching their full-power
attacks.  
"―【World Rejection】...【Dancing Reaper】―!"  
  
A desperate blow, layering a combat art on top of the Iron Rose combat
art.  
The light of World Rejection traveled along the blade, and the black
knife, now a "sword," sliced away the new limbs as if scything them
down, like the dragon fangs from which it was made.  
And the little cat's Rank 6 combat art deeply tore through the Chimera's
body, which had lost its defenses.  
  
***"GIIIGYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"***  
  
The Chimera's death throes echoed. But it wasn't dead yet.  
Even if one more push would win, that one push was missing. The Chimera
was an aggregate of countless beasts. Even if it died, as long as there
were living parts, it wouldn't truly die.  
Those living parts targeted the two who had attacked. The little cat,
having just unleashed a combat art, couldn't move.  
Alia, having layered combat arts, was no longer in a state to fight.  
Alia's eyes, about to receive the attack, reflected "me" instead of the
enemy Chimera.  
  
I'm not alone. I no longer need to fight by myself.  
I've become an adventurer. And if this is an adventurer's party, Alia
the scout is the skirmisher. The little cat will probably be a
warrior.  
Both of them have the role of "damage dealers" in the party.  
So what am I? I am a "mage." I use my intellect to reduce the party's
danger and wield different types of magic. What is the most important
thing for a mage?  
It is... overwhelming "destructive power."  
  
Believe in yourself. Believe you can do it. If I can't do it here, then
that vow to live for Alia, and Alia's feelings, will be wasted.  
Level 5 isn't enough. But, I focused my attacks on Lightning and Ice,
and because of that, my Magic Control level, which had been stagnant,
reached 6.  
I, who only believed in my own power, obtained 【Soul Thorn】 to use
magic beyond my level. With little life left, I wished for the ability
to "borrow" that power, believing I could eventually reach that realm
with my own strength.  
And now, that time has come.  
I... can do it!  
  
"―【Lightning Bind】―!"  
  
Lightning thorns entangled the Chimera's massive body, continuously
inflicting damage with fierce lightning without disappearing. Feeling my
mana dwindle for the first time due to the enormous consumption, I still
unleashed the final blow.  
  
"―【Freeze】―!"  
  
The Chimera froze solid, turning pure white―  
CRACK...  
The lightning's restraint shattered the frozen Chimera into dust, and
ice crystals danced like powder snow in the dungeon.  
"This is... the end."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The battle with the Chimera is finally settled. It was subtly long.  
Why did I decide to write this in an afterstory...  
But the ending is planned to be even more amazing...  
  
Anyway, in June, Volume 6 of the book and Volume 3 of the comic
adaptation will be released in the same month.  
Please check the activity report for details, along with the cover
image!  
This time, it comes with a rare illustration of Alia's smiling face!  
  
Thank you always for your typo reports and support.
