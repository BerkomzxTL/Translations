## 267 The Will of the Dungeon

As we entered the lower levels of the dungeon, battles with monsters who
didn't fear us increased.  
There were still beast-demihuman monsters like ogres, but as Alia's
hypothesis suggested, the proportion of beast-type monsters was
increasing the deeper we went.  
While killing these monsters, I quietly continued my observations atop
kitty-chan.  
  
―Battle―  
"It's saying to work harder."  
"Yes, yes."  
  
I continued my observations while fending off monsters from a
distance.  
I decided to fight with "lightning" and "ice" magic in place of the fire
attribute I had lost.  
Lightning magic is a composite magic of water and wind... but what about
ice magic, I wonder?  
Alia's 'Illusory Magic' is also a composite magic of light and darkness.
However, even though I can use light and darkness at a high level, I
can't use Illusory Magic.  
Illusory Magic involves wrapping oneself in the magic itself. It's not
like merely covering the surface, like the earth magic 【Rock Skin】;
it's more like harboring the magic itself within one's body.  
I surmise that I can't use it because my magic control skill is
insufficient. It probably requires a magic control skill of level 6...
no, at least level 7.  
Alia made it possible by combining it with 【Combat Arts】, a magic that
uses the body, specifically 【Iron Rose】.  
The Cere’zhula technique, which was its basis, probably kept magic
control within level 5 by only wrapping it around a weapon for an
instant.  
  
I can't use body-enhancing combat arts like Alia. I don't even have
skills for close-combat weapons. As a lady, I've never carried anything
heavier than a severed head.  
Even when I was four, carrying my brother's charred remains was
difficult...  
Well, that's beside the point, but essentially, I can't imitate Alia or
Cere’zhula.  
  
Lightning magic is relatively stable, but I feel a slight decrease in
its power. It's a subtle difference that only I can perceive, though.  
In contrast, with ice magic, I distinctly feel that something is
missing.  
From here on, this is my own theory, but I believe that various
attributes are intricately intertwined in magic. For example, with
'Storm' type magic, whether fire or ice, the magic of a mage who didn't
possess the wind attribute was clearly slower than mine.  
I'm guessing that if they didn't even have the life magic 【Flowing
Wind】, it wouldn't even activate?  
That's probably why it's essential for mages to learn all life magic.  
  
Therefore, mages with many attributes are simply stronger.  
That's why my lightning magic, having lost the fire attribute, feels a
little weaker. Still, fire isn't that heavily involved in lightning, so
it's a minor reduction.  
But ice magic is different. Generally, ice magic is said to be advanced
water magic, not composite magic.  
Even so, if my theory is correct, wouldn't ice magic involve more other
attributes more deeply than other attribute magic?  
  
Wind attribute gives speed to ice magic.  
Earth attribute gives hardness to ice magic.  
Fire magic... I suspect it's related to "temperature."  
That's why it doesn't freeze instantly. It doesn't freeze to the
internal organs instantly, so there's a possibility of receiving a
counterattack if I encounter an Alia-level enemy.  
If that's the case... I have no choice but to use ice magic while being
conscious of the remaining two attributes.  
Something like this, perhaps...?  
  
"―【Ice Whip】―"  
  
Conscious of the earth attribute, my ice whip didn't just strike down
three horned wolves, but pierced all three simultaneously and froze them
from within.  
"It's surprisingly useful."  
***"Gaa..."***  
"It's saying to do more."  
"............"  
Why does Alia understand kitty-chan's words?  
  
After that, our progress speed also increased, and we reached the
eightieth floor.  
But...  
"Are there fewer monsters?"  
"Yeah."  
  
Not only had I started using new tactics, and not only had Alia and the
little cat gotten used to the new dungeon monsters, but our progress
speed was increasing because the monsters, which had started to
increase, were decreasing with each descent.  
  
***"Gaa..."***  
The little cat looked ahead... downwards, as if bothered by something.  
I feel like not just the dungeon's ecosystem, but "something" is
amiss.  
  
＊＊＊  
  
The dungeon was changing.  
A dungeon is an ancient hermit crab that parasitizes a cave or structure
as its "shell" and becomes a monster. Over the years, it becomes an
immobile "core," but it absorbs the lingering thoughts of creatures that
died within the dungeon, until its intellect reaches the level of a
spirit.  
Separately, there also exists a dungeon spirit that has absorbed the
thoughts within the dungeon.  
The dungeon's will is to survive. To absorb the life force of living
beings and the mana of the earth, and to grow infinitely.  
The dungeon spirit's will was to return the dungeon's power to the
world. The spirit, having absorbed the wills of countless heroes, passed
that power to new heroes, guiding the world towards good.  
  
This dungeon was cleared a few years ago.  
In the past, it had been cleared every few decades to centuries, but the
clearing a few years ago was not by a saint or a king who guided people,
but by the brute force of weak individuals consumed by desire, risking
countless lives.  
  
The dungeon thinks in order to "survive."  
Even weak creatures, if numerous enough, can clear the dungeon. For now,
it is satisfied with the rewards given by the "spirit," but foolish
individuals might become consumed by further greed and even threaten the
dungeon's survival.  
The dungeon spirit thinks for the sake of the "world."  
It believed that even weak individuals, if given a 【Gift】, would
become "heroes" and work for the world. However, all those who received
blessings from the spirit used them for their own desires, killing
countless of their own kind.  
  
The dungeon thought. Perhaps this dungeon was too weak.  
For its survival, to gain the mana and life force of dead creatures, it
needed outside creatures to enter, and it had adjusted the environment
to be suitable, but it considered it not good for weak individuals to
easily defeat the deepest monsters.  
The dungeon spirit thought. Perhaps it had expected too much from
humans.  
The "hero" the spirit sought needed not only strength of heart but also
the ability of a hero. At the very least, it considered monsters that
weak individuals could defeat in groups to be insufficient in power.  
  
The dungeon decided.  
The dungeon spirit decided.  
A strong monster, worthy of the dungeon's deepest reaches, is needed...
it thought.  
  
There is no communication between the dungeon and the dungeon spirit.
Even if they knew of each other's existence, there was no point in
communicating due to their different thought processes.  
Two different wills made the same decision, and by these two wills, the
strong monsters within the dungeon began to fight, devour each other,
and repeatedly evolve as they aimed for the deepest reaches.  
  
Strong monsters need advanced intelligence to see through enemy
strategies and fight, like "humans."  
Strong monsters need the wild strength to fight with claws and fangs,
like "beasts."  
Monsters will devour each other, and the area around the lowest floor
will likely be sparse for a while. But both wills consider this a
necessary process.  
  
Dozens of strong monsters, gathered to the deepest reaches by the
dungeon's will.  
The dungeon spirit, by its will, bestows "blessings" upon these strong
monsters, evolving them into a single monster.  
  
Two thoughts that became one...  
But neither possessed a "human" heart.  
The dungeon was only interested in its own survival, and while the
dungeon spirit loved humans, it could not understand human life.  
  
***"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"***  
  
A colossal shadow roared in the deepest part of the dungeon.  
In the human kingdom... within the Claydale Kingdom's dungeon, the worst
monster, a calamity for its people, was now born.

The being born in the deepest part of the dungeon is...
