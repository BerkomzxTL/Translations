## 287 The Hero's Reason

"Please, become mine."  
The moment Hero Klein said that and pressed his lips to the back of
Alia's hand―  
KA-BOOOM!!  
Alia, still seated on the sofa, waved her hand as if swatting a bug, and
a shockwave echoed as if the air in the room had exploded.  
  
The members of "Rainbow Blade" grimaced and braced their feet, while the
Holy Church folks couldn't even withstand it and fell on their butts.  
Even so―  
"...Quite aggressive, aren't we? That's precisely why you're worthy of
being my companion."  
Hero Klein smiled gently, having caught Alia's hand chop, which was
faintly glowing with silver light.  
In that instant, Alia had used "Rejection World" for just a moment,
without even using Iron Rose. Having grown accustomed to extremely
purified mana and Level 5 magic, she unleashed an attack of over 3000
combat power for a mere second.  
That would instantly kill an Ogre. She's gotten stronger again. ...But
how powerful is the Hero to remain unfazed after receiving that...?  
  
"...Snow, restrain yourself."  
"...Why?"  
Without looking at Dalton, who was trying to stop me from beside me, I
smiled with just my mouth, my mana surging.  
Become the Hero's "property"? Who? By what right?  
I'm aware that I'm not normal, but I'd still bless Alia if she were
happy, you know? But that's a no-go. There's no way Alia would be happy
with that. In that case, wouldn't it be better to make him understand
his place? Why should I stop? Miranda and Jesha look displeased too,
don't they? Tell me, is there any reason for me to hold back―?  
"Because Alia hasn't drawn her weapon."  
That answer came not from Dalton, but from a scowling Feld.  
"............"  
I see? So there's that theory too, huh?  
"Snow."  
Alia's faint voice reached me. When I looked her way, Alia was indeed
glaring unhappily, but she wasn't trying to kill the Hero.  
She's grown up so much... I'm a little lonely. I miss the old days when
we used to clean up roadside trash together. But that's beside the
point.  
  
When I suppressed my intimidation and magic, the Holy Church members
finally started breathing again.  
Amidst them, Hero Klein, who had remained cool-faced, spread his arms
wide with a bright smile, as if in welcome.  
"Magnificent...! To meet such beautiful *women*, it was worth coming all
the way to this continent."  
Saying that, he knelt before Alia again, who was giving him a cold
stare.  
"My apologies, young lady. I was so overwhelmed by such a wonderful
encounter that I lost myself for a moment. May I introduce myself
again?"  
Saying that and extending his hand, Hero Klein also gave me a
meaningful, knowing smile.  
  
"K-Klein! How can such a barbaric woman be a companion to the Hero, it's
preposterous!"  
At that moment, the Cardinal, who had been speechless from the shock and
sitting on his butt, complained to Alia instead of Klein. Oh dear, even
my intimidation was blamed on Alia.  
"Why not? "Champion-class" individuals are not ordinary, you know?"  
  
The Hero's companions, chosen by spirits and recognized by spirits, are
"champion-class."  
The Hero's companions in fairy tales vary by story, but generally
include "Saintess," "Sword Saint," "Holy Warrior," "Great Sage,"
"Archmage," "Great Spirit User," and so on. Alia, blessed by spirits,
falls into that category, but there's no "Assassin" among the Hero's
companions, is there?  
  
"B-But even so―"  
"You called me because you have business with me, didn't you?"  
Even so, Alia interrupted the Cardinal's increasingly loud words, and
though her voice wasn't loud, the Cardinal choked on his words, the Holy
Church members involuntarily gasped, and Hero Klein's face lit up with
joy.  
"That's right. I've taken on a mission from the Holy Church's main
temple."  
"Klein!"  
The Cardinal's voice grew harsh, trying to stop Hero Klein from
mentioning the "mission." But the Hero stared intently at the
middle-aged Cardinal as if admonishing a child.  
"Lord Crawford... if you are to be my "companion," you should know these
things, shouldn't you?"  
  
...What are they talking about?  
A Hero from another continent... The Holy Church, which boasts the
largest faction on this continent, is also said to have come from
another continent about a thousand years ago. Perhaps if their authority
is still higher, that would be hilarious.  
The "main temple" the Hero refers to isn't this temple, but one on the
other continent, and these important people here, who act so high and
mighty, are just branch managers, aren't they?  
Whether the discussion was settled, or if he simply had no intention of
showing respect to this Holy Church despite being polite, the Hero
quickly cut short his conversation with the Cardinal he called Crawford
and turned back to Alia.  
"I imagine you've guessed, but I'm here on this continent on an official
mission. It was fortunate to meet someone like you here."  
  
Hero Klein spoke to Alia.  
Several years ago, the "Spirit of Light" who chose the Hero gave an
oracle. ...I wonder if they have spirit worship on the other continent.
Anyway, the content was that they detected signs of a "Dark Dragon"
appearing on this continent.  
A Dark Dragon, a dark elemental dragon, would become an "Evil Dragon" at
Rank 8 if it grew. Evil Dragons are man-eating dragons that hate humans,
and the Holy Church there, feeling the immediate need for subjugation,
decided to send the Hero. However, the Hero was informed by the Spirit
of Light on the ship that the Dark Dragon had been defeated as soon as
it appeared.  
  
"""............"""  
At that story, all of "Rainbow Blade"'s gazes turned to Alia for a
moment, but she didn't bat an eye, as she thought everyone had defeated
it together.  
Anyway, Hero Klein's trip was a waste of effort. Wouldn't it be better
if he just went home quickly? But his story wasn't over yet.  
  
"Evil Dragons are said to be an ill omen, you see. It's also said that
when an Evil Dragon appears, a "Demon Lord" appears. In fact, the Spirit
of Light detected signs of Level 8 fire magic being used. I'm here to
investigate that."  
  
"""............"""  
At that story, the gazes of "Rainbow Blade" turned to me for a moment.  
It was just a joke we talked about before, but seriously, how rude. If I
had that kind of power, I wouldn't be having such a hard time.  
  
"I haven't seen any such signs since coming to this land. If the Dark
Dragon has been destroyed, I don't think there's a problem, but... well,
Miss Alia. I'd like you to participate in my Fire Dragon subjugation."  
  
............Huh?  
For a moment, I didn't understand what the Hero was saying, and not just
us, but everyone fell silent. Oh, how rare, even Alia's eyes are wide!  
"W-Wait, Klein, why does it come to that?"  
Surprisingly, Cardinal Crawford, who recovered first from the confusion,
asked him, and Klein smiled cheerfully without panicking.  
"You said it yourself, didn't you? That the Fire Dragon on the other
side of the Holy Mountain is a handful."  
  
Three countries surround Holy Mountain Kyrios. To the south is the
Fandora Theocracy, to the west is the forest where the Forest Elves
live, and to the east is the Kingdom of Zentore.  
And to the north, a vast grassland stretches out, but that place is
called the Dragon Hunting Grounds, and apparently, a Fire Dragon has
been using it as its hunting grounds for several decades. The Kingdom of
Zentore, which tried to claim that territory in the past, received a
harsh welcome from the dragon and suffered thousands of casualties.  
A human army cannot defeat an elemental dragon that flies in the sky. It
breathes fire from heights beyond the reach of arrows and magic, and if
it sees an opening, it attacks in an instant, killing many soldiers.  
  
"Hero... the Fire Dragon is not an evil entity."  
At that, Vincent, the Temple Knight who guided us here, glared at him as
if to admonish him.  
"But there are still casualties, aren't there?"  
Hero Klein retorted with a cool expression, not caring about the
glare.  
"It's only a few dozen adventurers or those who stray too far each
year."  
"And the Holy Church intends to overlook a mere few dozen people?"  
"I'm saying that if we interfere carelessly, the damage will
increase!"  
  
Dozens of casualties a year. Most of them are accidents or
self-inflicted, but it's not so few as to be overlooked. But if we
interfere carelessly and the Fire Dragon holds a grudge against humans,
will the city be burned and tens of thousands die? But...  
"That's precisely why, while I, the "Hero," am here, we should just
defeat it!"  
Hero Klein declared this to Vincent, who argued that it was necessary to
accept it as a necessary sacrifice, as if stating the obvious.  
  
"Wait. Don't just start talking on your own. I said you should speak
through me."  
At that moment, Dalton stepped forward, emitting an intimidating aura.  
Dalton is strong. But he's not strong enough to take on the Hero, yet he
still stepped forward.  
"...I'm speaking with Alia-san, aren't I?"  
Hero Klein sighed, his conversation interrupted repeatedly.  
"A young girl who's just come of age should be protected by an adult,
shouldn't she? The Fire Dragon subjugation is your political matter,
don't involve Alia in it. Besides, why do you need to subjugate a Fire
Dragon to recruit Alia?"  
Was Dalton quite angry with the Hero for saying such arbitrary things?  
Feld and Jesha also looked displeased, subtly exuding a bit of
intimidation, and Hero Klein shrugged as if to say, "Oh, for goodness
sake."  
  
"It's to confirm whether Alia-san was able to defeat the Dark Dragon. If
that's a lie, then the Kingdom of Claydale will need to take
responsibility."  
At that moment―  
Alia's brow furrowed slightly at the phrasing, which was like holding
the nation... or rather, Elena, the one responsible this time,
hostage.

What will Alia think?  
Did he perhaps step on a tiger's tail?
