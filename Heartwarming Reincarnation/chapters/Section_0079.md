# Chapter 79・It’s a Treasure Hunt

"A treasure hunt…!"  
  
I want to, I really want to!  
I looked at \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] with excitement while she
puffed out her chest and nodded proudly.  
  
"Mhmm, mhmm. Your enthusiasm is commendable. Now, I shall explain.
Listen carefully."  
"Mhm."  
"The Elf Queen's magic is merely a temporary measure. If you overuse
your mana or strain yourself, the Mana Pathways will thicken again
quickly, just like today. Furthermore, the mana you possess is
incredibly powerful. If too much time passes, the core will eventually
fail."  
"Mhm."  
"Therefore, we shall seek out my treasures."  
"Waoow…!"  
  
'\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]’s treasures’. What a… what an alluring
sound…!  
I involuntarily let out a gasp, and \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]
chuckled with satisfaction.  
  
"I created seven jewels that support the world. And, I also created
three sacred treasures."  
"Uh-huh!"  
"The three treasures are designed to interfere with mana…Normally, they
were intended to amplify mana in times of world crisis, annihilating
enemies, or creating large-scale barriers for protection, but…"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] shrugged wearily.  
  
"To think that my treasures would be used to save a single, young elf…
However, if you perish, the world will end, so it can't be helped."  
  
Then with a \*snap!\* she pointed at me.  
  
"You shall use the three treasures to control your mana."  
"Control my mana."  
"That’s right. Gather the three treasures to suppress your excessively
powerful mana. Further hone your \[Mana Manipulation\] and refine your
senses when using mana."  
"Mhm!"  
  
This excitement in my chest… how can I describe it?  
  
—My life is at stake.  
—The end of the world is at stake.  
  
But, more than anything else…  
  
—Items I don't know about!  
  
I can experience something new in my beloved world.  
That makes me so happy…  
  
"Samyu!"  
  
I wanted to share this overflowing excitement with Samyu, so I looked up
at her, who's by my bed.  
I thought surely Samyu would look at me with kind eyes.  
But…  
  
"…Samyu?"  
  
Samyu wasn't looking at me.  
Samyu's eyes, gazing at the sky, reflected nothing…  
Samyu was her usual self up until I put out the flames that threatened
the Elven Forest.  
But now that I’ve woken up after another \[Mana Rampage\]… what is it
like…?  
It's not the usual Samyu.  
She seems… insecure… It feels like she's reverted to the Samyu I first
met. The Samyu from before we made our guardian contract.  
I looked up at Samyu, trying to gauge her condition. But our eyes didn’t
meet…  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] continued speaking without paying any
attention.  
  
"As they're my treasure, I know the locations. Therefore, I shall guide
you."  
"Guide me?"  
  
Samyu is worrying me, but first I need to listen to \[The Black Bahamut
Dragon\].  
Apparently, she knows the location of the treasures.  
  
"一The first treasure. Its location is \[The Lake of Refreshing
Rain\]."  
"Waoow!"  
  
\[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\]…!"  
That's one of my favorite maps. The exceptionally beautiful water
surface, rendered in CG. I wonder what color that water actually is…  
It was a place I had wanted to see when I realized I had been reborn
into my favorite game world. I can actually go there…!  
My chest began swelling with excitement again.  
  
—I want to see it.  
—I want to know it.  
—I want to feel it.  
  
I can't stop these overflowing feelings.  
  
"The treasures, you see, cannot be obtained by just anyone. It’d be a
problem if someone were to use them carelessly. So, I entrusted their
protection to my familiars."  
"Familiars"  
"Yes. The \[Water Serpent (Naga)\], who dwells in \[The Lake of
Refreshing Rain\], guards the treasure."  
"Naga!"  
"Even though they are my familiars, they don't always listen to me. I've
been asleep, and I want the inhabitants of this world to live as they
please."  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] chuckled.  
  
"The \[Naga\] is strong, you know? Young elf. Will you still go?"  
  
As she said that, her violet eyes pierced me as if testing me.  
I faced that gaze head on.  
  
"There’s only one answer."  
  
—It's decided, right?  
  
"Leave it to Reni!"  
  
The treasure guarded by the \[Naga\] who dwells in \[The Lake of
Refreshing Rain\].  
Let's get it!
