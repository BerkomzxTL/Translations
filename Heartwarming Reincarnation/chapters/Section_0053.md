# Chapter 53・It’s an Undercover Investigation

What I'll do to destroy the church… is―  
  
“Play dead.”  
  
That’s right. Pretend to be asleep.  
My plan is to be carried to the church’s hidden room.  
This way, the couple would seem to have successfully completed their
task of drugging us, and the others would let their guard down.  
So…  
  
“Lady Reni, if anything happens, please start fighting immediately.”  
“Mhm. Samyu, you too, go right away if necessary.”  
“Yes!”  
  
After confirming this with each other, Samyu and I collapsed onto the
dining table.  
With the empty plates on the table, even the cult members should be
fooled.  
After confirming that Samyu and I were pretending to be asleep, the
couple went outside through the front door. Soon after, I heard
footsteps. I cautiously opened my eyes a crack and saw men who looked
like those from the Slanita Finance building.  
Wow… The church was beautiful and felt sacred, but these people are from
the same organization? They look like common thugs.  
It would be tough for ordinary people to resist them.  
  
“Oh, you did a good job.”  
“Y-yes… ah, they’re just sleeping, so please be gentle.”  
“We know. The priest told us too."  
  
The couple’s words were met with a sneer from the men.  
Then, each of us was hoisted onto the shoulders of a different man, and
we left the house.  
We were headed toward the church. I couldn’t see ahead because I was
carried over someone's shoulder, but I can tell from the scenery. I
narrowed my eyes and checked my \[Exploration Bracelet\]. The golden
magic stone glowed faintly. There must be a hidden room here, and the
children must be there.  
  
“Alright, open it.”  
“Right.”  
  
The men walked up to the altar and stopped.  
After checking carefully through half-closed eyes, I saw that one man
was taking out a red crystal from his pocket.  
  
“Ah”  
“Ah, you’re awake?”  
  
I unintentionally let out a sound.  
The man carrying me adjusted my position so my face was visible.  
No, no, I have to pretend to be asleep.  
  
"...Guu."  
“No, she’s asleep.”  
  
I relaxed my body and tilted my head slightly.  
Seeing me like that, the man seemed to conclude I was asleep. He hoisted
me back onto his shoulder again.  
As expected of me, the strongest four-year-old. I’m good at pretending
to be asleep.  
  
“What was that?”  
“I thought she woke up, but it must have been my imagination.”  
“You’re overthinking it. It’s fine if one child wakes up. We can carry
them anyway.”  
“That’s true.”  
  
The men talked as they went around to the back of the altar.  
I hadn’t been able to see this far when I was guided by the priest, but
apparently there was a magical device behind the altar.  
That’s right. It’s exactly the same as the one in Shultem’s house, the
mayor of Slanita. A hidden door and a basement, and a mechanism to break
it down. So, when I saw the red crystal, I couldn't help but let out a
sound, but luckily I was able to cover it up nicely.  
  
“Hey, stand back.”  
“Right.”  
  
One of the men spoke, fitting the red crystal into a recess behind the
altar. Then there was a rumbling sound.  
The men were standing awkwardly apart in a corner of the floor. A
section of the floor where they had been began to move slowly.  
And then—  
  
*‘Samyu, the entrance.’*  
*‘Yes, it seems this is the passage to the hidden room.’*  
  
I communicated with Samyu using \[Telepathy\]. Samyu is probably
pretending to be asleep while watching her surroundings.  
  
“Alright, let’s go. The elf goes to the priest. The child to the
prison.”  
“Is it okay to put her with the others? Beastkin are strong, aren't
they?”  
“Even if they're a beastkin, she’s still a little kid. She can’t do
anything.”  
“That’s true.”  
  
Apparently, Samyu and I are going to be taken to different places.  
  
*‘Lady Reni, it seems we’re being separated. What should we do? Should
we fight here?’*  
*‘Samyu, you’ll be okay by yourself, right?’*  
*‘Yes, I think that’s no problem. I don’t plan to lose.’*  
*‘Then, let’s continue like this. Samyu, please take care of the
priest.’*  
*‘Understood.’*  
  
Now that we know where the entrance to the hidden room is, I could
defeat everyone right here, but I need both the priest and the children.
So, splitting up is just right.  
I'm fine on my own, and Samyu is strong too.  
So, I'm just going to go with the flow and allow myself to be taken
away.  
Behind the altar, where the floor had opened, a staircase leading down
to the basement appeared. We descended into the basement and walked down
a stone-walled corridor. The man carrying Samyu opened a door along the
corridor and went inside. The priest is probably beyond that door.  
The men opened another door beyond and went into a room. I could see
inside through the crack in the door; there were many men. I guess it's
a waiting area for the men.  
The man carrying me was the last one remaining in the corridor. We
arrived at a door at the end. It was bolted and had a large padlock. A
guard was sitting in a chair next to the door.  
  
“Open it.”  
“Right. A new kid?”  
“Yeah, we’re going to sell this one soon.”  
“Hmm. Well, beastkin are rare, so she’ll sell for a high price.”  
“Yeah. The priest apparently doesn’t need beastkin.”  
  
As they were having this conversation, the guard opened the padlock and
unbolted the door. The door opened, and the man carrying me went into
the room. There—  
  
“I hope you haven’t been doing anything troublesome.”  
  
—were the children.  
  
“One, two, three… eight. Okay, everyone’s here.”  
  
The man confirmed the number of children, pointing at each one. The
oldest child seems to be in the upper grades of elementary school, and
the youngest was younger than me.  
The children huddled together in the corner of the room, looking
scared.  
  
“She’s your friend.”  
  
With that, I was thrown onto the floor.  
  
“Eh… why, another child…?”  
  
Seeing me, the oldest child spoke timidly.  
The man chuckled gleefully.  
  
“Your parents, see, they drugged this one.”  
“Papa and Mama…”  
“To protect you, this beastkin child was tricked and brought here.
You’ll meet your parents here, but this one will probably never see them
again. She’ll be sold tomorrow. Isn’t that sad? It’s all your fault.”  
  
The man’s voice was slimy…  
  
“You’ll only be friends for a day, but be nice to her. After all, she’s
being sold for your sake. Isn’t that sad?”  
  
I could see the children’s faces fall at those words.  
It seems they were using this kind of talk to manipulate them.  
Confined to the basement, seeing their parents only briefly, and
constantly being told things like this… their will to resist was
broken.  
…I feel sick.  
  
“I came here because I chose to.”  
  
I stood up from the floor where I had been thrown.  
I clenched my fist and drew my elbow back.  
  
“Ah, you woke up—?”  
“I’ve been awake the whole time.”  
  
The man looked down at me in surprise, his eyes widening.  
I aimed a straight punch at his lower abdomen.  
  
“Cat punch!”  
  
My fist, aimed slightly upwards, hit the man’s lower abdomen. And
then—  
  
“Become a fossil!”  
“Gwaaaah!!”  
  
—The man was embedded in the stone wall.  
  
“Okay.”  
  
One down.  
I relaxed my fist, looking at the buried man.  
Then, there was a chorus of voices.  
  
“…Amazing!”  
“Strong…!”  
“How can you do that!?”  
“Are you alright? It didn’t hurt, right?”  
  
It was the children from the corner of the room.  
They surrounded me in an instant. Some were excited, others were worried
about me. They were all different, but they all seemed somewhat
uneasy.  
So, I raised the thumb of my \[Cat's Paw Gloves\].  
  
"I'm here to help."  
  
—Let’s go home!
