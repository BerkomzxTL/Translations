# Chapter 84・There Was a Reservoir

The place Hamu mentioned was on the mountain side of the lake. Perhaps
the groundwater stopped flowing into the lake for some reason.  
So, we came to investigate that "some reason," and what we saw was—  
  
"A well?"  
"I see… So, they built a large well to pump out the groundwater."  
"Indeed. It looks like the water vein has been completely cut off
here."  
  
—A reservoir.  
It seems they're using a well upstream to pump out groundwater that
would normally flow to the lake, collecting it to form a reservoir.  
Until now, \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\] fulfilled this role, but it
seems they've artificially created this one.  
  
"The water is muddy because it's made by humans, isn't it?"  
"Yes. The reservoir's construction is also flimsy. It seems likely to
collapse if the water level rises due to heavy rain."  
  
Samyu frowned, and Hamu sighed with exasperation.  
From their perspective, this reservoir doesn't look very good.  
If that is the case, then surely it would’ve been better if the
groundwater continued flowing into the lake as before. Why did they
build it like this?  
As I tilted my head, I heard a series of voices and the sound of
footsteps on the grass.  
  
"Hey, hey, there are three kids here!"  
"Huh? Those village folk again?"  
"They're persistent."  
  
Four men with menacing looks appeared, laughing with a gahhahaha. Each
carried a weapon at their waist.  
One of the men snorted.  
  
"It's the same every time."  
  
They seem to think we're villagers.  
This means villagers frequently visit this place, and they don’t seem to
have a very good relationship.  
  
"Wait a second. Take a closer look. They all look sellable."  
"That's right. An elf, a dragon girl, and a cat beastkin?"  
"It’s rare to see an elf. I've heard rumors, but she's even more
beautiful than I imagined!"  
  
When the men saw Samyu, they whistled.  
And Samyu glared at them with icy eyes. Samyu really hates this kind of
thing, I've seen her like this often…  
  
"That dragon girl is rare, but that cat beastkin too. At that age, she’d
sell, wouldn't she?"  
"Ah, that reminds me. There's a place that buys children for five times
the market price…"  
"She'd definitely fetch a high price there."  
  
The men shifted their gaze from Samyu to me. Their eyes gleamed.  
This look is the same as the debt collectors from the village where I
lived with my parents. To certain people, I apparently look like
money.  
  
"That place doesn't buy anymore. They said the higher-ups disappeared or
something."  
"Huh? Is that so? What a shame. She would have definitely sold for a
high price…"  
  
The men slumped their shoulders in disappointment.  
It seems my defeating Count Gaillard was worth it. The kidnapping and
sale of children, rampant in this country, will likely decrease.  
Because the organization that buys children is gone.  
  
"Anyway, these guys are unrelated to the village. This is our land. Get
out."  
  
The men waved their hands vigorously to shoo us away.  
I exchanged glances with Samyu, turned on my heel, and walked away from
them.  
  
"What? What are you going to do? Weren’t you going to restore the
lake?"  
"Mhm. I’ll get it back."  
"Then, destroying this is the fastest way. With the young elf's power,
it would be a single blow."  
"Mhm. Reni is strong."  
  
Hamu fluttered through the air, following Samyu and me.  
Hamu's right, so I nodded. Samyu let out a sigh.  
  
"Lady Reni has her own way of thinking. Well, maybe a dragon wouldn't
understand."  
"I told you to call me Hamu! That's too harsh!"  
"Lady Reni intends to observe the situation first. From their
appearance, demeanor, and conversation, it's almost certain they're
villains. Destroying that facility would likely be fine, but we can't be
sure."  
  
It seems that Samyu understood what I wanted to do from that brief
exchange of glances.  
  
"Information gathering first. Isn’t that right, Lady Reni?"  
"Mhm."  
  
I nodded at Samyu's words and put on the hood of my \[Hermit's Robe\].  
Now I can mask my presence and investigate those men!  
  
"Ohh… the young elf's presence is gone. Even I can't find where she is…
You really have something incredible."  
  
Hamu was surprised by the effect of the \[Hermit's Robe\]. This is a
rare item I grinded for in my past life's game. It must be rare here
too.  
So,  
  
"Reni will use this to investigate."  
"Yes! I'll search for the men from the forest. I'll stay near Lady Reni,
so please call me if anything happens."  
"I stand out a lot. I'll fly around for now."  
"Mhm."  
  
Let's investigate the purpose of the men who built the reservoir!
