# Chapter 85・It’s the Basics of Business

While remaining invisible, I followed the men.  
There’s a hut near the reservoir where the men apparently live and
patrol.  
They seemed to be quite well-off. There was a lot of expensive looking
alcohol, and on a piece of paper that looked like it had been used as a
notepad, there were prices written at high rates, suggesting they had
been gambling.  
Further searching revealed documents tucked away in a corner of a shelf
where the expensive liquor was stored.  
Examining the contents, I found―  
  
"Selling water."  
  
―It was an account book for the business the men were conducting.  
Apparently, they were selling water from the reservoir to the village at
the foot of the mountain.  
The village seems to rely on the pure water flowing from the \[The Lake
of Refreshing Rain\] to cultivate crops. So, running out of water is a
matter of life and death.  
Knowing this, the men had drained \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\] and
created the inferior reservoir.  
  
I don’t think there’s anything inherently evil about collecting and
selling water.  
But this…  
I pondered.  
Among the documents, I found a single sheet of paper that was different
from the others, bound in leather. As I picked it up, I heard pleading
voices from outside the hut.  
  
"Please. We've prepared the money here."  
"Twice the amount we initially sold this land for. This is to buy it
back."  
"This should be enough, shouldn't it!?"  
  
The unusual situation prompted me to go outside and look for the source
of the voices.  
There, I saw an old man and a middle-aged man.  
They were offering a leather pouch to the men by the reservoir. It
looked very heavy  
  
"Well, we'll take the money."  
  
One of the men snatched the pouch from the old man.  
The old man stumbled, and the middle-aged man quickly supported him.  
  
"This is this week's water payment."  
"What!?"  
"No! We brought this to buy back the land!! There’s no way the water
would cost that much!"  
"Huh? We decide the selling price. If you think it's too high, don't buy
the water."  
"Damn… you know we can't! There's no other water source around here. Our
village lives off this water…!"  
"You need water. We have the water. If you want water, pay. And we, the
sellers, decide the price. That's obvious, isn't it? You're idiots."  
"We have no intention of selling this place. We officially purchased
this land from your village. We even have the title deed."  
  
I looked at the leather portfolio in my hand. It must be the land
deed.  
The men let out vulgar laughs.  
  
"We're just doing business according to the law. We bought the land from
you. You even said, 'It's a blessing to have someone buy this mountain
in the middle of nowhere'."  
"That's true… but if things continue like this, we won’t be able to grow
crops in the village. The water is too expensive. Water shouldn't have a
price… to sell it for such a high amount…"  
"Huh? Buy low and sell high. It's natural. It's supply and demand,
right? If the water is expensive, add the water cost to the price of
your crops."  
"Who's going to buy crops that expensive!"  
"That's your problem, not ours. Anyway, we're not selling this land. But
we will sell you water."  
"At this rate… the village will disappear…"  
"We don't care what happens to you!"  
  
The old man trembled, and the middle-aged man’s face contorted in
frustration.  
The men watched them, chuckled, and then drove them back to the
village.  
Alright. Got it.  
Making up my mind, I used \[Telepathy\] to send a message to Samyu, who
was hiding in the forest.  
  
*'Samyu.'*  
*'Yes! Lady Reni!'*  
*'—I’ll defeat those men.'*  
*'Understood!'*  
  
The thing they were doing, even going so far as to dry up \[The Lake of
Refreshing Rain\] that I longed for, was reselling water. What's more,
they were destroying a village in the process.  
In the long run, the village's destruction wouldn't benefit them. But
they only care about the immediate money.  
Once the village is gone, they'll move to another place, ruining the
area and moving on to the next.  
…My stomach churned.  
I stood in front of the men and removed my hood.  
  
"Listen."  
"““Huh!? What!?””"  
  
The men were surprised by my sudden appearance (from their perspective)
and tensed up.  
I ignored them and showed them the leather portfolio.  
  
"This… I'll give this to the old man."  
"Wh…What!? That’s our land deed!"  
"I saw you get the money. I'm going to be a witness to your business."  
"What are you saying, you brat!? Give it back!!"  
  
Seeing the land deed in my hand, the men seemed to lose their temper.  
One of them lunged at me.  
I kicked the ground and dodged his attack.  
  
"Guh!? Wh…What? What is this…?"  
  
The man, who intended to grab me, ended up sliding to the ground with a
thud.  
He looked back and forth between the ground and at me, stunned.  
  
"Let me tell you."  
  
I looked down at him and calmly stated.  
  
"If you receive money, you give the goods."  
  
Right? Taking money without giving goods is fraud.  
  
"Shut up! You brat!"  
"Something's weird about this kid! Attack together!!"  
"““Yes!””"  
  
There were four men in total. Everyone I initially saw was present.  
Each of them warily approached me.  
  
*'Samyu, Samyu.'*  
*'Yes, Lady Reni!'*  
*'Can you get the money?'*  
*'Leave it to me!'*  
  
When I sent out my \[Telepathy\] to Samyu, she immediately responded.  
Then, a beam of light shot out from a nearby tree.  
It flew straight toward the leather pouch one of the men held.  
  
"Hi-!?"  
  
The man let out a pathetic scream as the pouch slipped from his hand and
fell to the ground, impaled by an arrow.  
As expected from Samyu! So accurate!!  
  
—Now, all that’s left is to blow them away!  
  
"Cat's Claws!"  
  
All of them at once.  
  
"Become stars!"  
  
—Twinkle  
  
"Okay."
