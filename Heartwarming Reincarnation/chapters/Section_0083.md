# Chapter 83・I Found a Water Snake!

"Beautiful... water..."  
  
I was really looking forward to \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\]. I never
expected that the water would be gone.  
I slumped my shoulders, completely disheartened by the sight that was so
different from what I had imagined.  
  
"Lady Reni, look over there!"  
"Hm?"  
  
Samyu called out to me as I approached the dried-up lake and peered into
the large, empty basin.  
Following where Samyu pointed—  
  
"Oh, something's there."  
"Ah... um. Ah... there it is."  
  
Hamu mumbled something to herself.  
In the little bit of remaining water at the bottom of the deep basin, a
light blue serpent was forcing its enormous body into the water.  
Because there was only a small amount, only the snake's large belly was
submerged. It was coiled, but its head lay limply slumped over on its
body.  
...Clearly weak.  
I think this is the '\[Naga\]' that guards the treasure that Hamu
mentioned...  
  
"Naga, strong?"  
  
Seeing such a pathetic sight, I couldn’t help but ask Hamu.  
Hamu said the \[Naga\] is very strong, but to be honest, maybe because
it looks lifeless right now, it doesn't seem that way at all.  
Hamu looked to the heavens in response to my words.  
  
"The \[Naga\] is, you see, a serpent that controls water."  
"Mhm."  
"It can shoot water like blades, create water shields, and is a very
difficult monster to fight."  
"Mhm."  
"…In other words."  
"Mhm."  
"Without water—it's just a big something."  
"A big something..."  
  
As Hamu said this, she gently gestured at the \[Naga\].  
  
"Finish it off. And get the treasure."  
"Is that okay?"  
  
I thought Hamu expected me to fight a strong \[Naga\] and get the
treasure. I tilted my head, puzzled by the casual permission to defeat
the current \[Naga\].  
Then Hamu nodded and said, "Umu."  
  
"I can restore this lake to its original state. But this, too, is fate.
It's the luck that the young elf attracted."  
"I see."  
  
Hamu is a dragon who became the foundation of the world. In that
respect, she's probably detached. But I—  
  
"Jump!"  
  
I used my \[Winged Rabbit Boots\] to spring off the ground.  
My destination is the bottom of the lake. I floated down towards the
dried-up bottom.  
  
"Naga."  
*'...'*  
  
I was only a step away from the \[Naga\].  
Even if it's weakened, if the \[Naga\] were to rampage now, I'd be in
trouble. The \[Naga\] seemed to sense my presence and extended its
head.  
But it didn't bare its fangs at me, and simply laid its head on the
lakebed. Then, it opened one eye slightly, and immediately closed it
again.  
'Do as you please.'  
That's probably what it meant.  
  
"Water... dried up?"  
*'...'*  
"Who did it?"  
*'Humans.'*  
"I understand."  
  
I gently placed my cat’s paw on the \[Naga\]'s nose.  
  
"Right now, treasure, unnecessary."  
  
Hamu told me to defeat it and get the treasure.  
Anything goes; I could win against the \[Naga\] and obtain the first
treasure with just one technique. An overwhelming victory.  
But—  
  
"...I want something more fun."  
  
Right! An overwhelming victory is nice, but that's not all there is to
the fun of a game!  
Against a strong enemy, you level up, use items, change party members,
and swap skills. If that still doesn't work, you can watch a walkthrough
video. That's how you win with your wits, skill, and dedication! I like
that kind of thing too.  
That's why—  
  
"Water, I’ll bring it back."  
  
—Restore \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\] to its original state!  
And then fight the \[Naga\] with its original strength and win. That's
definitely the most fun.  
The \[Naga\] opened both eyes at my words. I nodded firmly.  
Then, I let go of the \[Naga\] and kicked off the ground.  
  
"Samyu, I want to bring the water back."  
"Yes! Lady Reni!"  
  
I returned to Samyu from the lakebed.  
Samyu nodded with a smile at my declaration.  
Then Hamu's shoulders started shaking...  
  
"Fuwahahaha! That's interesting! Good job, young elf! Hilarious!"  
  
She laughed loudly, baring her fangs.  
  
"I thought helping you would disrupt the natural order, but it's alright
now! I have heard your wish to fight a strong \[Naga\]."  
  
Hamu narrowed her purple eyes.  
  
"This is an area that gets a lot of rain. Rain that falls on the forest
becomes groundwater and springs up here. That accumulated water forms
this lake. In other words, the lake drying up means there's been a
change in the groundwater that it uses as a source."  
  
Then, she pointed sharply toward the depths of the forest.  
  
"The scent of water cuts off there. Shall we go?"  
"Hamu, thank you for the information."  
  
I was planning to ask Samyu to investigate, but thanks to Hamu, she
saved us some trouble. When I thanked her, Hamu puffed out her chest.  
  
"This is nothing! But more importantly, little elf. This is far more
complicated and troublesome than defeating the \[Naga\] here, you
know?"  
  
Then, Hamu's purple eyes gleamed suspiciously, as if testing me.  
So I nodded, "Mhm."  
  
"Reni, will do it."  
  
To fight a strong \[Naga\] in the most beautiful \[Lake of Refreshing
Rain\]!  
  
"Samyu, let's go!"  
"Yes!"

TN: With this chapter the releases are caught up to the [manga
adaptation](https://mangadex.org/title/21cde143-531f-4e60-916d-2e7daaee4647/honobono-isekai-tensei-days-level-counterstop-item-mochikoshi-watashi-wa-saikyou-youjo-desu?tab=chapters).
It's pretty 1:1 with the WN up until the start of the Mana Manipulation
Arc (ch 67, elven forest). A little more fleshed out.
