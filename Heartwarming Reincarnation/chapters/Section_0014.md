# Chapter 14・Bad Guys Keep Popping Up

After getting the IOU back, my mother quit her job at the bakery, and my
father also started working less.  
Since they no longer needed to repay the debt, they both had more free
time.  
My father's friend's wife (the friend who framed my father, resulting in
his own death) apparently took over the bakery. It seems that that job
alone can support the single mother and her two children.  
I have my own thoughts about how they framed my father, but the debt
itself was a setup, and if our family was the reason, it becomes a
question of which came first, the chicken or the egg.  
I think it's a good thing if not having to pay debts means that both our
family and the other family can live independently.  
It seems that my father plans to provide financial support in the future
when large amounts of money are needed (for the children's further
education or marriage, etc.).  
As long as my parents continue to live in the village, it seems there's
no role for me to play here.  
  
My father's work hours have drastically decreased; he mainly does
trapping now.  
He still sets traps and collects the animals, but he's stopped going far
to hunt large game or chasing animals day and night.  
Instead, he spends more time on housework, gardening, and family time.  
Lately, it feels like my father's always holding me. He picks me up at
every opportunity.  
I think he's trying to make up for all the times he was sick or busy.  
When father lifts me up, my viewpoint gets higher, which is fun, and my
legs get a rest, so I'm happy too.  
  
—And so it seems peaceful at first glance, but of course, it's not that
simple.  
The IOU was a crucial tool for the debt collectors to threaten our
family, and the reason they were extorting money was to take my
mother.  
It would have been easier if it were just about the money...then it
could have been compensated by someone else.  
But as long as their goal is my mother, our family will continue to be
targeted.  
And even now…  
  
Ting-ting.  
  
A small bell rang at my waist, just as I was about to go to sleep.  
  
"Enemy detected."  
  
I sat up from the bed and slowly moved the blanket.  
After putting me to bed, my parents went to the dining room
downstairs.  
I was starting to doze off, but I quickly got ready.  
The bell sound earlier is from an item called a \[Detection Bell\],
which rings when an enemy is nearby.  
The bell ringing means there are enemies near the house.  
It's rung several times before, even in front of my parents, but they
didn't seem to notice, so it seems only I can hear it.  
Still...  
  
"Stubborn."  
  
They haven’t given up. It's been a week since I got the IOU back. Every
day, a few of them wander around this area.  
However, the \[Evasion Talisman (Special)\] seems to be working
properly, and they haven't been able to find our house—  
  
"Can’t go on like this."  
  
If this continues, my mother will remain in danger.  
I think my father is reducing his work hours and staying home to protect
us.  
My mother and I stay home, and my father goes out only when necessary.  
While this house seems safe, my father doesn't know that, and neither
does my mother. So I imagine they've been on edge this whole week…  
Therefore―  
  
"Item box."  
  
As I mutter this, the items are displayed.  
I equipped the \[Hermit's Robe\] and \[Cat's Paw Gloves\].  
And this time, also the \[Winged Rabbit Boots\]!  
  
"Confirm."  
  
The moment I spoke, I was equipped with the items.  
  
"Mhm. Okay."  
  
I hopped in place to check the \[Winged Rabbit Boots\].  
My body floated slightly, and I felt a significant reduction in the
effects of gravity.  
  
"This will make my legs go faster. I won't get tired."  
  
I chuckled.  
Although my level is maxed out, I'm still a three-year-old. I get
exhausted from a little walking or running.  
The \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], as the name suggests, are made from the
materials of winged rabbit monsters and have a very high agility
increase. As an additional effect, it grants a \[Flying\] state.  
From what I just tried, it's not constant flight; it's more like I get a
little boost when I push off with my feet.  
  
"Okay. Let's follow them."  
  
The bell attached to my waist is still jingling.  
Finally, I gently placed a letter on the bed.  
  
*'Leave it to me.'*  
  
Now, let's blow away the bad guys!
