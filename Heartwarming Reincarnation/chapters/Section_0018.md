# Chapter 18・Let’s Conduct an Investigation

Humans have many emotions, but "fear" is an important one. I think it's
one of the survival instincts necessary for living.  
Stay away from things that scare you. Don't do anything that scares
you.  
That emotion allows us to avoid danger.  
So, if these debt collectors mistake me for an evil spirit, that's
convenient.  
Be drenched in fear from the tips of your toes to the top of your
heads!  
So...  
  
"I won't forgive you."  
  
I muttered this, then tossed a piece of rubble.  
  
"Eeeeek!"  
  
Simultaneously with the sound of the rubble hitting the wall, a man
screamed.  
Very satisfying.  
I chuckled, then tightened my expression.  
Then, trying to sound as scary as possible, I varied the tempo, speed,
and direction, throwing the rubble one after another.  
  
"I won't forgive you."  
\*Thud, Eek!\*  
"I won't forgive you."  
\*Bang, Eeeek!\*  
"I won't forgive you."  
\*Clatter, Eeeek!\*  
"I won't forgive you."  
\*Crash, Eeeeek!\*  
"I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you! I won't
forgive you!"  
\*Eeeeeeeeeek!!\*  
  
As expected of the strongest three-year-old, me. Quite a good evil
spirit role-play.  
The man was extremely frightened, and even those who had woken up were
trembling together.  
If they're this scared, I think these men won't attack my house
again...  
  
"It's not our fault, we were just following orders..."  
"That's right... we were just... please forgive us..."  
  
They huddled together, begging for their lives in fear.  
While I don't have any sympathy, it’s exactly what I want to hear.  
I was thinking of asking the leader, but he's still unconscious, and
these men seem to know something, so I might as well ask them.  
Yes, let's ask.  
  
"Who gave you the order?"  
"Uh... that's..."  
"Who?"  
  
I threw a piece of rubble at the men, who were hesitating to speak.  
The shard of glass, narrowly missing them, embedded itself deeply into
the wall.  
  
"Hhh..."  
  
The men turned pale at the sight of the shard of glass stuck in the
wall.  
Then, while begging for mercy, they spoke.  
  
"It's the head of this town...!"  
"—The mayor, Shultem!"  
  
The frightened men clasped their hands in front of their faces, pleading
as they broke down.  
That's the name of the mayor of the town; in other words, the most
important person in this town.  
...I see.  
I guess someone quite high up was trying to get my mother.  
Standing in front of the men trembling, I pondered deeply.  
  
"A lie?"  
"N-no, it's not a lie...!"  
"It's true, there's proof... proof!"  
"Proof?"  
"W-we don't know the details, but it's true, it's true...!"  
"The safe, there should be something in the safe..."  
  
There's a possibility that the men are making things up out of fear.  
However, considering the reason why the gatekeeper let the suspicious
men pass without checking them, it seems plausible.  
  
"Haah..."  
  
The person who gave the order is more important than I thought, and I
let out an involuntary sigh.  
If someone like that sets their sights on you, it's incredibly
troublesome.  
  
The kingdom I live in is a monarchy, ruled by a hereditary royal
family.  
Supporting them are the lords, high-ranking nobles, who also use a
hereditary system and have remained unchanged since the founding of the
kingdom.  
The kingdom is divided, with each lord ruling their own territory,
called a domain. Domains are further divided into cities.  
The lord appoints the head of the city, called a city mayor.  
The city mayor is usually the lord's child, sibling, relative, or a
subordinate who has achieved great merit. This is not hereditary; the
king bestows a one-generation title of nobility. These are the lower
nobles.  
And if a city has a large town, that town has a town mayor appointed by
the city mayor. From here on, those in charge are typically commoners,
mostly wealthy merchants and civil servants.  
The town mayor, of course, governs their own town, but they’re also
usually responsible for overseeing nearby towns or villages as well.  
Those towns and villages have their own town heads and village chiefs,
but these are chosen by consensus and serve as coordinators.  
Well, the town mayor of Slanita also happens to oversee my village—  
  
"There you are!!!"  
  
As I was lost in thought, a knife flew over my head.  
It was pretty high up, so it completely missed me, but if I were an
adult, it might have hit me. Hmm. So. You do things like that, huh.  
  
"...What?"  
  
I thought if they were properly scared, that would be fine.  
It seems they still have the willpower to fight back.  
  
"I-it wasn't me! It was him, it was him...!"  
"It can’t be... I threw it in the direction of the voice, why didn't it
hit? Could it be, really..."  
"You idiot! What are we going to do?! You take responsibility...!"  
  
The man who threw the knife was berated by the others and pushed to the
front.  
In the end, there were twelve people besides the leader that I dug up.  
One of them apparently threw a knife at me.  
He must have identified my location while listening to my conversation
with the other debt collectors. The height was different, but the
direction was roughly correct.  
They’re so afraid because I’m unknown, but it was probably a bad idea to
have a conversation with him to get some answers. Yes. When you feel
reason, fear decreases, doesn't it?  
So...  
  
"I won't forgive you."  
  
Let's just blow them away.  
  
"Cat's Claws!"  
  
I extended my right claw and swung my hand upwards.  
Then, an updraft was generated, creating a small whirlwind.  
The whirlwind sucked in the surrounding objects and headed towards the
debt collectors, and—  
  
"Become stars!"  
  
Whether conscious or not.  
Everyone together flew towards the sky from the open space.  
  
*‘Hiaaaaaaaaa!’*  
  
—Tonight's meteor shower is very beautiful.
