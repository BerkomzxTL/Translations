# Chapter 28・The Elves' Secret

Six months living with my parents.  
I don't intend to just spend that time leisurely.  
There are many things I need to do to ensure my father and mother can
live peacefully.  
The most important is the mayor of the town of Slanita, Shultem.  
I need to investigate his movements. If he's lost interest in my mother,
then fine. But if he's still aiming for her—  
  
"I heard Lady Reni called for me!"  
  
Samyu appeared before I could finish the soup my mother made.  
She slid into the house and quickly knelt on one knee beside my chair.  
She must have been in a hurry; she was supposed to be in the forest, but
she's back so quickly. Her cheeks are flushed, and her breathing is
ragged.  
How did she know I called for her?  
  
"Samyu, thank you for coming."  
"No, it's absolutely no problem! I'm honored that you called for me,
Lady Reni..."  
"How did you know?"  
"I heard it from the Queen."  
"From Mama?"  
  
But my mother was here the whole time and didn't seem to be doing
anything…  
When I tilted my head, my mother laughed softly.  
  
"I'll teach Reni the secrets of the elves."  
"Elf secrets?"  
"Elves live long lives, but they don't have many children. That's why,
when a child is born, everyone cherishes and raises them."  
"Yes. All elves have a sense of family."  
"That's right."  
"Among them, young elves become guardians of younger children, and it's
special."  
"Guardian?"  
"That’s right. A guardian protects and cherishes a young elf so that no
danger befalls them. And it's a special contract only elves can have,
allowing young elves to grow through their interactions with the young
children."  
"Actually, my guardian is Her Majesty."  
  
As I nodded, Samyu's face lit up with joy.  
  
"When Samyu was born, I was only 140 years old. It feels like such a
long time ago."  
"Eh?"  
  
Wait, wait. I just heard a strange number.  
  
"Mama, one hundred and forty?"  
"Oh, that was around the time I met Samyu; I'm much older now."  
"Mama, how old are you?"  
"I'm 270 years old now, I think."  
"Two hundred and seventy…"  
  
No matter how you look at it, she looks to be in her late 20s... There's
a zero missing.  
  
"Samyu… how old are you?"  
  
My mother was 140 when Samyu was born, and she's now 270. So that
means…?  
  
"I'm still young. I just turned 130."  
"One hundred and thirty…"  
  
No matter how you look at it, she is younger than I was before I was
reincarnated. She looks like a junior high school student... There's a
zero missing.  
  
"Elf secrets are amazing."  
  
I was shocked. This is the most shocking thing I’ve experienced since my
reincarnation.  
So this is what it means for elves to have long lives…  
My mother and Samyu chuckled at my dumbfounded expression.  
They continued to explain about guardians.  
  
"When you make a guardian contract, you can communicate without saying a
word, no matter how far apart you are."  
"It's \[Telepathy\]."  
"That’s what I used to call Samyu to our house."  
"When I found Lady Reni in Slanita and when we drew closer to the
village, I contacted Her Majesty myself."  
"I see…"  
  
When I returned from Slanita to the village, my father and mother were
waiting at the entrance; it was because they had received information
from Samyu.  
I'm relieved they weren't just waiting there the whole time.  
  
"Now then, Reni."  
  
As I was coming to terms with this, my mother looked at me intently.  
  
"I was wondering… Would you like Samyu to come with you on your
journey?"  
"With Samyu?"  
  
I looked away from my mother and met Samyu's gaze.  
Samyu's eyebrows were slightly lowered, her beautiful blue eyes
desperately looking at me.  
  
"Of course, if Lady Reni wants to travel alone, I cannot force myself to
go with you. However, I feel that Lady Reni is still small and frail and
travelling alone would make you quite conspicuous."  
"Because Mama and Samyu have a guardian contract, we can communicate
instantly with \[Telepathy\]. So, Mama would feel much safer if Samyu is
with you. …Even small things, I want to know what kind of day Reni is
having. I want to see Reni’s growth."  
"I will never be a burden to Lady Reni. I will definitely… definitely be
of use…! So please…"  
  
I looked back and forth between my mother and Samyu.  
I understand my mother's feelings; since her daughter is still young,
it's more reassuring if Samyu comes along. If I need a guardian, Samyu,
who can communicate with my mother through \[Telepathy\], is the best
choice.  
But…  
  
"Samyu, are you okay with this?"  
  
She seems so earnest, but I don't think there's any benefit for Samyu.  
Would she be happy traveling with me?  
She seems to adore my mother; she may just want to fulfill her request.
But it feels like it’d be a waste for her to follow me just for that.
Samyu should have her own life.  
So, I tilted my head, looking at Samyu.  
She bit her lip tightly before speaking.  
  
"I… have always had a dream that I wanted to make come true for a long
time. Her Majesty became my guardian and taught me many things. I
respected and admired Her Majesty… And when I was a child, I thought
that when Her Majesty married and had a child, the only elf who should
be that child's guardian was me."  
  
Her blue eyes were very strong—  
  
"It's been a hundred years since then. I've been working hard ever
since. I wanted to become the strongest elf. That's what I needed to
become the guardian of the Queen's child. I lived every day with that
goal in mind."  
  
Samyu had been thinking of me even since before I was born.  
Through the hard times and the difficult times. She must have overcome
them all, thinking of the child Her Majesty would give birth to… me.  
  
"When Her Majesty lost the ability to manipulate mana, I lamented my
powerlessness. When I heard that Her Majesty was to marry a human man, I
resented the human man. …And I thought that my wish would never come
true again. …But Her Majesty's happiness is all thanks to the human
man…. …I was a pathetic, useless, powerless, and weak elf."  
  
Samyu's strong eyes wavered.  
A weak elf... Samyu’s voice was hoarse as she said this.  
  
"When the \[Telepathy\] from Her Majesty, which had been cut off for so
long, resonated. When I heard that there was a child called Lady Reni,
the feelings overflowing from my chest wouldn't stop. I wanted to see
her as soon as possible… I wanted to see her with my own eyes."  
  
And so, Samyu came to see me.  
All the way from a rural village to Slanita.  
  
"When I met Lady Reni…. I will never forget it. Silver hair and golden
eyes. She appeared before me, carrying the light of a starry sky, and
jumped into my arms."  
  
I met Samyu when I jumped out of the basement of the Slanita Finance
building.  
She caught me as I lost my balance and fell.  
Shiny golden hair. Beautiful blue eyes.  
…I remember too.  
Yesterday, when I met Samyu. I'll never forget it.  
  
"I thought,"  
  
Samyu's blue eyes narrowed.  
Happily. Joyfully.  
  
"—That I had lived for this meeting, this person."  
  
A color so beautiful it draws you in.  
  
"I wanted Lady Reni to see my good points…. If I can help Lady Reni do
what she wants to do. But I only showed you my pathetic side…"  
  
…Samyu, who can't control herself because she cares so much for
someone.  
Samyu, who easily leaps over high walls and takes down distant monsters
with her bow and arrow.  
Samyu, who doesn't stop me, but tries to support me.  
  
"Samyu is amazing."  
  
I reached out to Samyu.  
  
"Samyu, let's go together."  
  
Let's have lots of fun together.  
  
"…Lady Reni…"  
  
Samyu clasped my outstretched hand tightly.  
  
"Ah… impossible… precious… impossible…"  
  
She fainted, her eyes rolling back.
