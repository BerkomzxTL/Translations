# Chapter 57・I Met Up With Pio

Carrie is in danger.  
Samyu and I, having discovered this information, immediately decided to
leave the village.  
The villagers were happy that their children had been freed and could be
reunited with their families. They tried to stop us, but right now,
Carrie is our priority.  
  
"Samyu, do you know where Carrie is?"  
"Yes. I asked about her itinerary when we parted ways. I believe she's
currently in this area."  
  
Samyu opened a map and showed me.  
I don't know the scale so I can't tell for sure, but it seems quite
far.  
  
"Far?"  
"Yes. I heard she's traveling quite a distance today. But with Lady
Reni's item and my enhanced abilities using \[Mana Manipulation\], I
think it will be possible to catch up."  
"Mhm. Let's go."  
"First, straight down this path."  
  
Guided by Samyu, we headed towards Carrie.  
It was a crescent moon tonight, so there wasn't much light. But it's
okay, I have cat eyes.  
I hopped along, while Samyu took long strides.  
  
"Lady Reni, we're almost there, but are you alright?"  
"Mhm."  
  
As expected from the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and \[Winged Rabbit Boots\].  
I've been hopping for about two hours now, but I’m not tired at all. But
actually, there is one problem...  
I'll deal with that after we meet up with Carrie.  
So I didn't say anything, when suddenly, a horse came speeding towards
us.  
The rider was—  
  
"Pio!"  
"…!? Reni!?"  
  
Pio is Carrie's knight.  
She should be protecting her along with many guards.  
But she’s alone.  
We stopped, puzzled.  
Pio recognized me and rode closer.  
  
"I'm sorry…!! Her Highness…!!"  
  
Pio stopped her horse nearby. Then, rolling off the horse, she knelt
before me.  
Her red eyes, looking up at me, were desperate—  
  
"Reni, I need your help... I know it's shameful to ask such a thing of a
young child like you, but you're the only one…!!"  
"Mhm. First, let's hear the story."  
  
From her panicked state and the desperate look in her eyes, it was clear
that something terrible had happened to Carrie.  
So, I urged her to calm down and explain, and she told me the
essentials.  
  
\* They were about to reach their lodging town when they were
ambushed.  
\* The enemy was a large number of \[Living Mail\].  
\* Pio fought hard, but was outnumbered and fell.  
\* When she came to, Carrie was gone, and Pio was unharmed.  
  
"Everyone else was wiped out. I should be seriously injured, but somehow
I have no wounds and my strength has returned. My armor and clothes show
signs of attack, so it's clear I was attacked and fell. And then, I was
holding this against my chest."  
  
She showed me an empty recovery potion vial.  
  
"Pio, did you drink it?"  
"No, I was unconscious and wasn't in a state to drink anything. But… my
clothes were wet."  
"I see. Carrie must have done it."  
  
Carrie had seen me use a recovery potion to heal the soldiers who fought
the dragon.  
So, she must have done the same for Pio.  
  
"Her Highness…"  
"Reni's recovery potion works even without drinking it."  
"Is that…so? It's that amazing?"  
"Mhm. Normally, people wouldn't know. But Carrie knew."  
  
Pio's eyes distorted with regret.  
  
"…Only I survived."  
  
Her soft voice was filled with pain.  
I know Pio cherishes Carrie.  
It must be incredibly hard for her.  
  
"The enemy is a large number of Living Mail. No matter how many people
we gather here, we won’t stand a chance. But if we go back to the
capital to request reinforcements, it'll take too long. It will put Her
Highness in danger."  
  
The reason Pio ran all this way alone…  
  
"Reni was the only one I could think of."  
  
—To find me.  
  
"I'm sorry… I truly feel sorry. I can't forgive myself for relying on a
young child like you. But I can't think of anyone else who can save Her
Highness."  
  
After saying that, Pio spoke softly, carefully choosing her words.  
  
"The light that erased the Living Mail at Mayor Thomas's mansion… that
was you, Reni, wasn't it?"  
  
…Mmn. She knows.  
  
"..."  
  
It’s pretty obvious my 'Become Light!' was me.  
I could just tell her, but Samyu seemed to want to keep it a secret, so
what should I do?  
I couldn't answer, and looked to Samyu.  
Then, Samyu took over the conversation on my behalf.  
  
"Why do you think it was Lady Reni?"  
"...Her Highness is a wonderful person. She works hard as the princess
of this kingdom. Not because of the rumored power she possesses."  
"So?"  
"So, I understand that the light didn't come from Her Highness. And you
said that you 'don't have the power to erase monsters' while facing the
Living Mail. You would never have said that and then used your power.”  
  
That's right. The timing was…it was after Samyu denied it…  
  
"While fighting the Living Mail, I felt like I was being protected by
something. I couldn't see it, but I occasionally heard Reni's voice and
recognized her way of appearing sporadically. I thought it was Reni. Her
Highness must have noticed as well, but she wouldn't say anything."  
  
Apparently, Carrie also thought the light was me.  
And I guess neither of them ever talked about it.  
  
"Me too. If Reni wishes, I won't tell anyone. Not now, nor in the
future."  
  
Pio's honest, red eyes.  
Looking into those eyes—  
  
"Okay. I believe you."  
  
—I nodded.  
  
"Lady Reni…"  
  
Samyu frowned worriedly.  
She's worried about me.  
  
"Samyu, it's okay."  
  
I smiled to reassure her.  
  
"Pio is a great knight. She won’t lie."  
  
I've known from the beginning that Pio is a very honest knight.  
When she was trying to protect Carrie, when she apologized to me, and
now. Her words have always been honest.  
  
"That light, Reni did it."  
  
Sometimes, my chest gets hot.  
If you collect that hot stuff, it’ll come out.  
  
"…Actually, I can't control it very well yet."  
  
But it's not 100% accurate.  
I don't know why it works sometimes and not others. But it works when I
need it, so I think I'll be okay.  
Even if that light doesn't work, I have maxed-out items!  
  
"It's okay."  
  
No matter how many people fall.  
  
"I'll save her."  
  
Because I'm the strongest four-year-old!  
  
"Leave it to Reni!"
