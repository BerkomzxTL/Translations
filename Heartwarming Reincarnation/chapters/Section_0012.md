# Chapter 12・Concealment Is Hard Work

\[Cat's Paw Gloves\], as the name suggests, are gloves shaped like a
cat's paws. Equipping them causes the character to grow cat ears and a
tail.  
\[Cat Punch\] is a strike-type attack, \[Cat Claw\] is a slashing-type
attack, and \[Cat Tail\] is a whip-type attack. These close-combat
attacks leave no openings.  
Because the character's appearance changes while equipped, I appear like
a cat beastgirl.  
The three debt collectors who saw me are now stars, but even if my
information leaks, they'll only find a "cat beast-person child."  
I can safely take off the hood of the \[Hermit's Robe\] and show my
face.  
The \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] allow me to freely move my ears and tail,
making them the ultimate disguise and weapon!  
So then.  
  
"I'll hide our house."  
  
Hiding my home.  
See, bad guys tend to appear in mysterious ways, and if the IOU
disappears and my parents stop repaying the debt, they'll definitely
come to our house again.  
Judging by today, I’m sure my father will fight back, but I'm worried
about my mother.  
I picked up the IOUs from the ground, put the hood of the \[Hermit's
Robe\] back on, and walked back home.  
  
"Item box."  
  
In front of the house, I muttered this, and selected the necessary item
from the long list.  
The one I'll be using this time is the \[Evasion Talisman (Special)\].  
In the game, this is used in dungeon maps. When the dungeon is large and
you can't return to the town map, you use it to camp within the
dungeon.  
In the game, camping restores health, magic, and other negative
statuses, but there's a certain probability of encountering monsters,
resulting in a camping being judged as a failure.  
Using an \[Evasion Talisman\] while camping reduces this failure rate.  
The success rate increases with (Average), (Superior), and (Special)
ranks. There's no (Legendary) rank for this charm, but (Special)
achieves 100% success.  
There are other charms usable for camping, including ones that increase
recovery values or add special effects.  
This time, I just need to keep those hostile towards my family away, so
the \[Evasion Talisman\] will do.  
In game terms, this village is a town map, so normally this charm can't
be used, but hopefully it'll work.  
Since I've flagged the debt collectors as enemies, I think it will
prevent them from finding my house, which serves as my campsite…  
  
"It should be fine to bury it."  
  
When camping, the motion when using the talisman involves burying it in
the ground.  
So, I swapped my equipment from the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] to a \[Ladle\],
select the \[Evasion Talisman (Special)\] and—  
  
"That one."  
  
A ladle in my right hand, a paper with a magic circle drawn on it—the
talisman—in my left. Time to dig!  
  
"…It's hard."  
  
So hard… I did my best using a ladle to spread fertilizer in the field,
but the ground is compacted…  
But I won't give up. This sort of thing is commonplace in games.  
Even if I chip away at it little by little, I will definitely get
stronger. I know that it’s the accumulation of small steps that counts.
I can do it!  
  
—Scratch… scratch scratch scratch… scratch scratch scratch scratch
scratch scratch…  
  
"Fuwaa…"  
  
It's hot. I'll take off the \[Hermit's Robe\].  
  
"Item box."  
  
I returned the \[Hermit's Robe\] to the item box and reverted to my
original appearance.  
Now, let's continue—  
  
—Scratch… scratch… scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch…  
  
"Fuwaa!"  
  
Before I knew it, my hands were completely black with dirt. I wiped the
sweat from my forehead with them, so dirt might be on my face too. But I
did it!  
I dug about 3 cm into the ground, placed the folded talisman inside,
covered it with dirt, and pressed it down. I completed the task…！  
I couldn't help but shout out in joy.  
Then, a worried voice called from behind—  
  
"Reni!!"  
"Papa~"  
  
I was hugged tightly.
