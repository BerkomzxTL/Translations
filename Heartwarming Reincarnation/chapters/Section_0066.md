# Chapter 66・My Body Is Hot

After defeating Gaillard, the four of us—me, Samyu, Carrie, and
Pio—talked about what to do next.  
We also searched the underground facility for evidence.  
Here's what we decided.  
  
\* The information Samyu collected from Niguru Village seemed like it
would be useful.  
\* We'll use the evidence of Gaillard's wrongdoing found in the
underground facility.  
\* We'll investigate the churches in Gaillard’s domain regarding the new
religious group, \[Tears of the Goddess\], for now.  
\* We'll issue warnings and conduct inspections in other domains as
well.  
\* We'll provide support to Gaillard’s domain to prevent it from falling
into disrepair or poverty, now that its lord is gone.  
  
It was decided that Carrie would handle this. She'll apparently report
and consult with her family, the King and Crown Prince.  
I think it sounds like a very difficult task, but she had a determined
look in her eyes.  
  
"I had given up, believing I was powerless. But when I thought
everything was lost, what remained was my pride as a member of the royal
family. I want to protect the people so that I won't shame myself."  
  
Carrie looked very radiant as she nodded with her chest puffed out.  
  
"Carrie, you can do it."  
"Reni..."  
"Carrie, you're amazing."  
"...Enough! Reni always makes me so happy…!!"  
  
Carrie hugged me tightly after saying that.  
  
"Every time Reni says that, it makes me stronger. …My words deserve to
be laughed at… Thank you for believing me."  
"Mhm."  
"I, I…"  
"Mhm."  
"I…!"  
"…Nn?"  
  
Huh? I thought Carrie was becoming more confident, but is she confused
again like before?  
I looked at Carrie, wondering what was wrong.  
Her face was bright red, and she was looking at me desperately.  
  
"I... I, Re-Ren-Reni..."  
"Reni?"  
"I, I, ... I..."  
"I?"  
"I... I love you! So much!!"  
  
Carrie, having mustered her courage to say that, hugged me even
tighter.  
Honestly, it hurts a bit.  
But, thinking that this strength represents the intensity of Carrie's
feelings, I gently put my arms around her back.  
  
"Mhm. Reni loves Carrie too."  
  
I whispered it softly into her ear.  
Then, the strength left Carrie's arms, which had been holding me tightly
just a moment ago.  
She just collapsed… and sat down limply…  
  
"Are you okay?"  
"...I'm not okay."  
"Does anything hurt?"  
"...Nothing hurts. But my legs gave out…"  
"I see."  
  
Carrie collapsed. I crouched down beside her.  
Then I put my hands under her back and behind her knees.  
Since I'm wearing the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\], I'm quite strong, so I
scooped Carrie up in a princess carry, but…  
  
"Reni… Reni…!!!"  
  
Carrie was on the verge of tears.  
Then, Pio, who was watching next to me, burst out laughing.  
  
"Sorry, Reni. It seems it was a bit too much stimulation for Her
Highness."  
"Stimulation?"  
  
I tilted my head in confusion.  
Then, Carrie yelled, "Enough!"  
  
"Pio, be quiet!"  
"Yes! Understood."  
  
Even with Carrie's order, Pio seemed amused.  
Then, she shifted her gaze to me.  
  
"Reni must be tired too? I'll take Her Highness from here."  
"Mhm."  
  
Pio lifted Carrie. Since she's taller than me, it's probably good that
she can get a better view with Pio holding her.  
  
"Still, to think that Reni was an elf. You have many different sides to
you."  
  
Pio murmured in amazement.  
The seal was broken, and my ears remained pointed. Because I'm wearing
the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\], I'm in a strange state—with both cat ears and
elf ears.  
Then, Samyu knelt before me worriedly.  
  
"Lady Reni, about that… are you feeling any changes in your body?"  
"Changes?"  
"Yes, the magic circle has changed Lady Reni's appearance. You must be
feeling completely different sensations than before. I can feel an
immense amount of mana from Lady Reni constantly."  
"Mhm. This is my mana."  
  
Unlike humans, elves have circulating mana. This allows them to enhance
their physical abilities and use magic.  
My mana had been sealed until now, but now I have a body where mana can
circulate.  
  
"Lady Reni, I thought that one day you would regain your mana… But it's
too soon. I thought it would happen after your body had grown more."  
"Samyu said I'd be able to do it when I got bigger."  
  
When I first met Samyu, she told me that one day I would be able to use
\[Mana Manipulation\]. To achieve that, I needed to train my body
without relying on items.  
So, I had avoided using items that would boost my physical abilities
aside from the \[Hermit's Robe\] and \[Detection Bell\].  
  
"Lady Reni. It feels to me like the mana you possess now is too much for
your body. Being able to act normal right now feels like a miracle to
me."  
  
Samyu looked like she was about to cry…  
  
"Now that I think of it… a little while ago, Reni's body felt incredibly
hot!"  
  
Carrie looked at me worriedly.  
  
"Reni… Are you holding something back again?"  
  
Pio's usually sharp brows were furrowed in distress.  
She knew I had stayed awake despite being sleepy, which is why she said
"again".  
Seeing their worried expressions…  
I gave up and confessed.  
  
"...Actually, maybe my body is hot."  
  
…Maybe. Maybe? Just a little, okay?  
  
"Lady Reni!"  
"Reni!"  
"Reni!!"  
  
The three of them turned pale at my confession.  
  
"I'll handle everything. Reni needs to rest…!"  
"Her Highness should rest as well. I'll arrange lodging, explain the
situation to the castle, and immediately summon Her Highness's guards
who are waiting."  
"I'm fine on my own. Please, Pio."  
"Yes!"  
  
After setting Carrie down, Pio immediately ran off.  
  
"Lady Reni, excuse me."  
  
Saying that, Samyu gently lifted me.  
I should put my hood up… ah… but…  
  
"Hot…"  
  
Something new was running through my body. Energy welling up and
overflowing from within.  
Confessing my physical discomfort and being embraced loosened the
tension I’d been holding. The instant that happened, my body felt hot
again.  
  
"As I thought, this is…!"  
  
Samyu's voice was filled with panic.  
  
"Mana rampage!!"  
  
While listening to Samyu's words as if from afar, I pondered their
meaning.  
'Mana Rampage'. It's something that elves sometimes suffer from.  
The most familiar case is probably my mother. She was supposed to die,
consumed by her mana. But a jewel that my father and Samyu found saved
her.  
She chose to become human, having her mana sealed. The jewel was passed
down to me, and I too had my mana sealed, having the appearance of a
human.  
But the magic circle broke the seal, and I, with the appearance of an
elf, have regained my mana. However, the power was too great for my
young body.  
The overflowing mana is eating away at my body. I see, this is indeed a
'Mana Rampage’.  
"What should we do? Reni looks very distressed."  
  
I heard Carrie's anxious voice.  
Samyu thought for a moment before answering.  
  
"...First, to the Elven Forest."  
  
—Our destination is the birthplace of my mother and Samyu.  
  
"The Elven Forest has methods to suppress a mana rampage surge to a
small extent and prolong life. In Lady Reni's case, the mana that had
been sealed was suddenly released, placing a large burden on her young
body. …Once her body grows, or she gets proper treatment, the runaway
mana can be controlled."  
"I understand. I'll prepare everything necessary to go to the Elven
Forest. Please tell me without hesitation."  
"Yes, please."  
  
Carrie and Samyu began discussing. It seems they plan to go to the Elven
Forest to do something about my body.  
But…  
  
"Samyu… Riwander too."  
  
\[The Wandering Capital, Riwander\]. I want to purify it with this
power, to help the monsters. I have to go there.  
But…  
  
"Sleepy…"  
  
I have things I want to do. But my eyelids are getting heavy.  
  
"Reni. You need to take care of your body first. Leave the capital to
me. I will definitely return the abducted children to their families.
Can't we go to Riwander after your body is healed?"  
"Mmn…"  
"Lady Reni, the Elven Forest is a place with very large trees, and homes
built into them. I would love for you to see it."  
"…Mhm"  
  
In the game, the elves lived in tree houses.  
A forest of giant trees so big the tops are hidden. It must be
incredibly beautiful.  
  
"Want to see…"  
  
As I murmured that, Samyu hugged me tightly.  
  
"Lady Reni, it might be best to remove the items other than your robe.
It might be increasing the burden on your body."  
"Okay…"  
  
I removed my items as Samyu instructed.  
I heard Carrie gasp, but my eyes were closed…  
  
"Please rest well."  
  
Samyu's gentle voice.  
I completely closed my eyes and breathed slowly, trying to control the
heat in my body.  
This isn't the time to give in to the heat.  
I've traveled a lot, seen many things, and learned many things…. There
are still so many things I want to do. For that!  
  
—I'll stop the mana rampage in the Elven Forest!
