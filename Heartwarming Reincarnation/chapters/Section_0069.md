# Chapter 69・Introductions Make Me Nervous

"This is...?"  
  
Samyu's words made me rub my eyes and look around.  
There were many large trees that would be unimaginable in an ordinary
forest.  
Just judging by the thickness of the trunks, they look to be over six
meters, and the height could be over 100 meters. There were tall trees
on Earth as well. But it wasn't just one tall tree, it seems like a
forest made up of gigantic trees.  
But that’s all.  
Considering what I knew from the game and what Samyu had told me, I
thought there would be houses built into these enormous trees, but...  
  
"Only... this?"  
  
When I asked curiously, Samyu laughed softly.  
  
"The Elven Forest is protected by ancient magic to prevent intruders."  
"Ancient magic?"  
"Yes. There's a spatial distortion right where Lady Reni is reaching."  
"Eh, here?"  
  
Startled by Samyu's words, I reached out.  
Nothing in particular seemed different.  
But there was a slight, unusual feeling on my hand.  
  
"...Maybe something's a little strange."  
"As expected of Lady Reni. Normally, one wouldn't even notice the
strangeness. To open this spatial distortion, you need a secret spell
passed down by the elves."  
"A secret spell...!"  
  
That sounds cool.  
Elves are mysterious because they don’t interact with other races. The
game mentioned their mysterious nature, but experiencing it firsthand is
thrilling.  
There’s the \[Telepathy\] that comes with a Guardian Contract, and
there’s probably so much more that only elves can do or know.  
  
"You need the spell and this elven certificate."  
"Ah, certificate..."  
"Yes. The one I used for inspection when entering Reoliga City."  
  
Samyu took out a palm-sized, azure stone.  
I remember hearing that it’s imbued with mana and has Samyu's name, her
parents' names, and the current Queen's seal to verify it. It’s like a
family registration certificate.  
I see. I guess you need an elven certificate to enter the Elven
Forest.  
In the game, the Elven Forest wasn't accessible to everyone; it didn't
appear on the map unless you cleared an event.  
I never would’ve imagined that it was hidden by ancient magic, but that
seems to be how it works in reality.  
  
"Well then, let's go."  
  
Samyu held me and skillfully extended her right hand into the space,
holding the azure stone.  
  
"\[Appear\]"  
  
As she spoke, Samyu's eyes sparkled.  
And then, a beam of light shot out from the azure stone. Instantly, the
scenery changed as if the fog had cleared—  
  
"Whoa..."  
  
—What appeared was a multitude of buildings and twinkling pink lights
everywhere.  
  
"Beautiful."  
  
Many tree houses were now visible, and I could sense the presence of
many people I hadn’t felt before. They must be the elves who live
here.  
The sun was setting, painting the sky purple. Large trees with houses
built into them. Pink lights were shimmering near them.  
It’s the fantastical world I had seen in the game. Now I’m seeing it
with my own eyes.  
My heart swelled with emotion...  
  
"...Eh?"  
  
...Eh?  
  
"What...?"  
  
My heart, which had been trembling with emotion, suddenly fell silent.  
All the elves were wearing matching headbands and holding pink glowing
sticks in their hands.  
  
"Lady Reni, you're too cute...!"  
"Lady Reni, please look this way...!"  
  
And voices came from all over the place.  
No, it wasn’t so much as calling out, but more like an expression of
feelings that couldn't be contained in one's heart... Yes, this is
enthusiasm. The elves are going wild.  
It's like—  
  
"A concert...?"  
  
It's like an idol concert venue…  
Are those glowsticks...?  
  
"Samyu... what is this...?"  
  
I looked up at Samyu, unable to believe what I was seeing.  
She nodded with a bright smile.  
  
"All the elves have been looking forward to meeting Lady Reni. The Queen
and the current Queen likely contacted each other using \[Telepathy\]
and made the preparations."  
"What's the glowing stuff?"  
"Those are branches from a \[Shining Tree (Fluorescent Tree)\]. It's a
rare tree with sap that glows. It only grows in the Elven Forest. While
they come in various colors, it seems to have been matched to Lady
Reni's color for this occasion."  
  
Elves on the trees were waving glowsticks. Elves on the ground were also
waving glowsticks. The ground-level elves formed a crowd around me, but
they kept a certain distance. I’m not scared, but I am bewildered.  
As my eyes wandered, Samyu gently held out her hand.  
  
"Lady Reni, the current Queen is here."  
  
I followed Samyu's gaze.  
The crowd parted, and a woman walked towards me.  
  
"The older sister of Lady Reni's mother. Your aunt."  
"Mmn."  
  
I stared at the woman approaching me.  
She has shoulder-length, neatly cut golden hair and sharp green eyes.
She was wearing glasses that perfectly accentuate her intelligent
appearance.  
My mother appears gentle, but her sister seems to be an intellectual
beauty.  
  
"You are... Reni?"  
  
The woman walked up to me and asked in a cool voice.  
Hearing that, I clenched my fists.  
My mother was the former Elf Queen. She became human and left the Elven
Forest to live with my father. Because of my parents' circumstances, I
had never met any of their relatives.  
Even in my past life, I was a shut-in, so I’m not used to these kinds of
greetings.  
In this world, I haven't felt the difficulty of socializing much, but
greeting a relative I'd never met before is nerve-wracking. I could feel
sweat forming on my palms.  
  
"Nice to meet you. I'm Reni."  
  
I looked her in the eye, speaking clearly.  
—It's okay.  
—I'm doing fine.  
—There's nothing wrong... right?  
I encouraged myself...  
  
"Pfft...!"  
  
Then, I heard a sound like air escaping.  
It came from... the woman in front of me?  
  
"So cute!! I love you!!"  
  
The intelligent, bespectacled beauty shouted to the sky—  
  
"Well done, Sonya!!"  
  
She clenched her fist and bared her teeth.
