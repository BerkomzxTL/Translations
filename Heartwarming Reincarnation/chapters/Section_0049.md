# Chapter 49・The Cult Is Suspicious

When I shone light on the living mail, it returned to a mere suit of
armor.  
The red-haired knight called this phenomenon "purification," and Samyu
seemed to want to hide the fact that I had done it.  
Samyu seems wary of Count Gaillard and Mayor Thomas of Reoliga City, so
it was probably better that it remains hidden.  
As a result, the red-haired knight started looking at me meaningfully
more often, but no one else seemed to be concerned. It’s probably
fine.  
  
Samyu said that the light I emitted might be magic.  
Because I'm currently sealed, I can't use magic. The mana that should be
flowing through me as an elf isn't circulating.  
However, when I defeated the dragon, Samyu sensed mana from me. And this
time too, she sensed it again.  
I can't reproduce it when nothing is happening, but I seem to be able to
use it when there's a trigger.  
I'll think about the conditions for using mana later, but there's one
thing that's bothering me—  
  
"Prophecy… does everyone know about it?"  
  
—About the prophecy.  
  
"One who possesses God's treasure will appear."  
  
A newly established religious cult that worships the goddess seems to
have received this oracle.  
It’s thought that Carrie might be the one prophesied, and she seems to
be going through a lot of trouble because of that.  
Carrie said the prophecy was made around the time she was born. Carrie
and I are about the same age.  
So, I was thinking. The one prophesied—  
  
—Isn't it me?  
  
After the tea party, at Mayor Thomas's mansion where I was staying,
Samyu and I were sitting on the sofa in one of the rooms.  
At my question, Samyu frowned slightly, looking troubled.  
She was probably thinking about what to say. After a short pause, she
slowly began to speak.  
  
"…That prophecy is a kind of fad. The sect spread it before Lady Reni
was born. All humans held a slight hope that their own child would be
the one…. Children born that year seem to have been raised more
carefully than usual."  
  
Samyu didn't try to deceive me.  
After saying that, she closed her eyes once.  
  
"And now…. The number of incidents where those children are sold,
abducted, and go missing is increasing all over the kingdom… like in the
town of Slanita."  
  
The mayor of Slanita, Shultem, had been using his power to gather women.
Although I liberated the women, the children who had been gathered with
them were already gone from Shultem's mansion. And he said:  
  
\* He was commissioned to gather children.  
\* They were around my age.  
\* Those with particularly striking appearances or outstanding talents
were preferred.  
\* He didn't know the client.  
\* But it was an introduction from the mayor of another large town.  
\* Selling them brings in money and expands connections.  
  
If we combine that with the story of the recent prophecy, the answer
becomes clear.  
The reason for gathering children is—  
  
—To find the "One who possesses the treasure of God."  
  
"I think the Queen and the human man… Lady Reni's mother and father,
also knew about the prophecy and raised Lady Reni in secret."  
"Mhm."  
"The Queen became human thanks to the power of the jewel. Perhaps… she
was thinking that maybe…"  
"Mhm."  
  
Surely my mother must have felt something when she conceived me. My
father, despite his appearance, has a keen sense of intuition. They must
have discussed it and decided not to register my birth in the village,
pretending I had died. That's why I don't have any birth certificate.  
Thanks to that, I was able to grow up healthy, without being sold or
abducted like other children.  
Samyu slowly opened her eyes. Her blue eyes were trembling sadly.  
  
"I'm sorry for not telling you until now."  
  
Samyu’s apology.  
I’m sure Samyu knew everything…. She must have decided to travel with me
knowing that I am 'One who possesses the treasure of God'.  
Samyu, who has taught me so many things. She never patronized me just
because I'm a child. The reason Samyu kept this quiet was….  
  
"Samyu's reason… I understand."  
  
She must have been worried….  
  
"She was thinking about Reni."  
  
She did it so I wouldn't be anxious. So I wouldn't blame myself.  
That’s why—  
  
"It's okay."  
  
If I am the child of prophecy.  
If it's because of me that the children are going missing—  
  
"Leave it to Reni!"  
  
I put my hand on my chest and puffed out my chest.  
Because I'm the strongest four-year-old!  
  
"I'll defeat them all. I'll save everyone."  
"Yes!"  
  
At my words, Samyu's eyes softened.  
And she nodded firmly.  
  
"I've gathered information about the whereabouts of the children. The
religious order is suspicious. However, outwardly, they are a charity
organization. And—it seems they may be connected to the central
government of this kingdom."  
"…Are they targeting Carrie too?"  
"I don't have any proof yet…"  
  
Saying that, Samyu got off the sofa and knelt on one knee in front of
me.  
  
"I will continue to work hard so that I can be of help to you, Lady
Reni."  
"Mhm… But Samyu, you're always cool?"  
"G-guh… Ghg… It's truly an honor to hear those words from Lady Reni!"  
  
Samyu took a deep breath, calmed down, and looked up at me.  
  
"I will now investigate this mayor's house."  
"Investigate?"  
"Yes. This is such a large city that information must be gathered here.
Being able to enter this mansion so openly was a stroke of luck. I'll
find out if children have gone missing around this city, if there’s
anything unnatural happening… and if the mayor, like Shultem, is
connected to anyone."  
"Mhm. Please."  
  
Now, let's investigate the religious order to save the children and
protect Carrie!
