# Chapter 17・It’s a Ghost

The fact that the ceiling collapsed means the roof has fallen.  
Since I was using the roof as scaffolding, I also fell into the house.  
Thanks to my \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], I descended softly and slowly,
landing on the first floor.  
  
"Safe."  
"Gweh!"  
  
The moment my feet touched the floor, a squashed frog-like sound came
from beneath.  
Probably someone was there.  
  
"Ugh... Uguh..."  
"Agh..."  
  
Listening closely, I can hear many such sounds.  
Six people entered the house, but there may have been more inside. I
knocked everyone unconscious in one blow, so I'm not sure.  
I decided to remodel the place thinking it would be easier to get it
done all at once, and it turned out perfectly.  
As expected of me. The strongest three-year-old.  
Fufu, I puffed out my chest. And since there's more I want to do, it’s
time to start on the next task!  
  
"Excavation!"  
  
The next task: excavation.  
  
"One, two, three, four, five, six..."  
  
I used the claws of my \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] to easily pick up and sort
the wood and broken furniture piled on the first floor.  
People to the left, wood to the right.  
I roughly separated the people from the debris, digging until the floor
was visible.  
While doing so, I managed to find what I'm looking for—  
  
"Found him. The leader."  
  
Moving a heavy piece of furniture, I found a large man.  
Yes, this is the leader of the six who came to my house.  
The others were trying to give up on targeting my house, but this man
stopped them and led the conversation.  
Because of him, no one gave up, and my house will continue to be
targeted.  
If he hadn't been there, the problem with my house could have been
solved relatively peacefully.  
  
"Let's talk."  
  
So, I decided I needed to talk to the leader.  
I hooked him with my claws and dragged him along.  
Although the roof is gone, the walls are still there on all four sides.
So, I’m having him sit with his back against the north wall.  
  
"Wake up."  
  
I tried calling out, but the leader showed no sign of responding.  
I had to move a lot of wood, furniture, and people to unearth him.  
It seems he was under quite a bit of weight, so his circulation was
restricted and he fainted.  
Hmm. Waiting for him to wake up is troublesome…  
As I was pondering, a voice came from my left—  
  
"What is this... What's going on... Damn it!"  
  
Apparently, someone woke up.  
Seeing the destroyed hideout and his carelessly piled comrades, the man
let out a scream.  
Too anxious to stand, he started crawling on all fours towards the
door.  
I guess he’s trying to escape.  
  
"Don't run."  
  
Leaving the leader alone, I stood in front of the man trying to run
away.  
And then—  
  
"Cat's Claw."  
  
\*Zash!\*  
  
I extended the \[Cat's Claw\] towards the floor in front of where the
man was about to move.  
Then, five deep grooves were carved into the floor.  
  
"HIIIIII!"  
  
Seeing the gouged floor, the man crawled back the way he came.  
He's desperately trying to hide himself using his piled-up comrades as a
shield.  
  
"I can't take it anymore... That house is strange... I should have just
backed off, this, this..."  
  
He was muttering and trembling with fear.  
I thought, "Hmm," and then used my claws to easily pick up a nearby
piece of debris, and tossed it.  
  
Bang!  
  
"HII!"  
  
The sound of debris hitting the wall.  
At that moment, the man shuddered and he let out a shriek.  
  
"Help me... Help me..."  
  
Perhaps it finally got to him, as the man clasped his hands in front of
his face and began to pray.  
The sight of him trembling and fervently praying truly showed his
terror…  
He really doesn't want any more eerie things to happen. That feeling is
strongly conveyed.  
  
"I see."  
"HIIII!"  
  
He overreacts even to my mutterings.  
Judging from his reactions, everything I do must seem like a
supernatural phenomenon.  
Maybe it can’t be helped.  
He can't see me wearing the \[Hermit's Robe\] with my hood up, and he
can't sense my presence.  
The roof suddenly fell, objects were moving on their own, and the people
were piled up. Then, as a finishing touch, claws were carved into the
floor, and objects started crashing into the walls—  
  
...Maybe it is scary?  
  
"It's a curse... We're cursed... hiii!"  
  
I clasped my hands together, causing the pads of my paws to make a
squeaking sound.  
The man freaked out over this cute noise as well.  
  
—It seems I've become an evil spirit.
