# Chapter 71・Reni Is a Genius

Samyu, and Hasano, the current Elf Queen who performed a \[Mana
Appraisal\] on Reni. After conferring, they decided to carry Reni to a
bedroom for rest.  
After confirming Reni was asleep, they moved to another room to discuss
the results of the appraisal.  
  
"What were the results of Lady Reni's \[Mana Appraisal\]?"  
  
Samyu looked at Hasano anxiously.  
Hasano's utterance after performing the \[Mana Appraisal\] had been
troubling her.  
Hasano closed her eyes, exhaled, and began to explain.  
  
"I suspected Reni was in a state of \[Mana Rampage\]. That’s because I
heard about it from Sonya. Then the appraisal actually confirmed it."  
  
"Reni possesses both her own mana and Sonya's mana. She has them both
within herself."  
"Such a thing…"  
  
Could something like that be possible? Samyu was incredulous.  
One person possessing the mana of two individuals was unheard of…  
  
"Sonya was exceptionally powerful to begin with."  
"Yes. I heard she was the strongest elf in our history. Her different
coloring at birth indicated this."  
"That’s right. Sonya was… a special child. Normal elves have blonde hair
and green eyes, but Sonya has silver hair and blue eyes. These are the
colors of the legendary ancestral elf."  
  
Sonya had strong mana, even among the elves. Her power was evident from
her coloring as soon as she was born, and she was destined to be the
next queen.  
  
"Everything was fine until Sonya became queen. But when her immense mana
became uncontrollable, I… I thought it was inevitable."  
  
Hasano recalled those days.  
A proud younger sister possessing magnificent magical abilities. She was
raised to be the next queen and was kind-hearted.  
…Because she received somewhat special treatment while growing up, she
became quite gentle and naive, even among elves. However, that too was
charming.  
When Hasano heard about the \[Mana Rampage\], she was heartbroken and
wished there was a solution, but somewhere deep down, she had accepted
it as unavoidable.  
A child born with such potent mana. Perhaps such sorrow was an inherent
part of it.  
  
"Perhaps elves live too long… Rather than thinking about how to live
individually, we think about how to live within the larger flow of
things.  
"When I heard about Her Majesty Queen Sonya's \[Mana Rampage\], I felt
hopeless. I only blamed my own powerlessness, and in the end, I couldn't
do anything..."  
  
It was Ward who changed Sonya's destiny.  
He disregarded Sonya's exceptional status. He wanted to live with Sonya
as an individual, not as a part of a larger whole, and acted
accordingly. So—  
  
"I won't let Reni die. I refuse to give up and resign to fate."  
"Yes. I intend to spend the rest of my life with Lady Reni."  
  
The two women exchanged determined glances.  
  
"Sonya's \[Mana Rampage\], plus Reni's own substantial amount of mana…
It's unclear why she possesses the mana of two people, but we will
definitely find a way to control it."  
"Yes!"  
"The truth is, I was also investigating various things back when it
happened to Sonya."  
"...Queen Hasano was primarily engaged in research, right?"  
"Yes. Although I wasn’t able to make it in time for Sonya, I’ve been
able to learn from my mistakes. Now I'm much more efficient, and I've
continued my research. I will never again allow another friend to die
from a \[Mana Rampage\]."  
  
Hasano laughed softly.  
Samyu saw her expression and lowered her gaze.  
  
"Your Majesty… you didn't simply give up on Lady Sonya. Compared to you,
I…"  
"Samyu, didn't you obtain the \[Jewel\] together with the human man?"  
  
Hasano patted Samyu's shoulder.  
  
"Reni has a vast mana source within her small body. Two sources, in
fact. Therefore, I believe that the \[Mana Pathways\] running through
her body are getting thicker and thicker, which is putting a strain on
her body."  
"The expansion of her \[Mana Pathways\] is burdening Lady Reni…"  
"Fever, fatigue, excessive sleepiness, lethargy. Sonya exhibited these
symptoms as well. My research has shown that the expansion of the \[Mana
Pathways\] is the root cause."  
  
Hasano nodded encouragingly.  
  
"Once Reni awakens, we should cast a spell to narrow her internal \[Mana
Pathways\]."  
"Narrow them?"  
"It won't be a complete solution, but it should alleviate her current
suffering."  
"Understood!"  
  
Samyu looked up.  
Hasano gently closed her eyes.  
  
"Reni is blessed with extraordinary talent… We must prevent this from
becoming a tragedy."
