# Chapter 50・Let's Go

A week passed, and I continued to stay at Mayor Thomas's mansion.  
I explored the garden with Carrie, and we ate meals together.  
Meanwhile, Samyu gathered information, investigating the city of Reoliga
and its surrounding towns and villages.  
As a result, we concluded that Mayor Thomas was not involved in any
wrongdoing.  
Several children had gone missing in the Reoliga area, but there was no
indication of Mayor Thomas's involvement.  
According to Samyu, Mayor Thomas isn't particularly sharp, but he
manages city affairs adequately. He seems content with his position as
mayor, harbors no great ambitions, and aims for a problem-free
retirement. Unlike the mayor of Slanita, Shultem, he doesn't aspire to
higher positions, suggesting he's not the type to take risks.  
My \[Detection Bell\] never ended up ringing either.  
There were no apparent enemies for Carrie. She was able to enjoy this
week without being exposed to any danger.  
Tomorrow, Count Gaillard, who returned to the capital, will come to pick
up Carrie.  
He seems to have replaced her damaged carriage and increased the number
of escort soldiers.  
While increasing the guard does help, there’s no guarantee of victory if
attacked by a dragon again. However, more soldiers means Carrie can
escape more easily. Above all, the red-haired knight is joining them
this time, boosting everyone's morale. She was able to fight a Living
Mail, so she’s very strong.  
  
"Lady Reni, I have some information."  
  
The night before we left, Samyu spoke up in our room.  
  
"There's a suspicious village nearby."  
"Suspicious?"  
"Yes. In Reoliga City and its surrounding towns and villages, there are
incidents of missing children and rumors of children being sold."  
"Mhm."  
"However, there’s one village where nothing of the sort has happened,
and there are no rumors about missing children."  
  
That’s certainly strange.  
Even in places like Slanita and my parents' village, where incidents
aren't openly reported, children are still going missing in the
surrounding areas of Reoliga. The fact that there are no rumors about it
is…  
  
"Unusual."  
"Yes. The villagers seemed to be avoiding the topic. And there's a
church-like building in the village, which appears to belong to a newly
established sect."  
  
Samyu looked at me, and I nodded.  
  
"Let's go."  
  
I thought it would be nice to go to the capital with Carrie, but I might
as well investigate this village.  
  
\* Carrie's safety will be ensured.  
\* I will eliminate the root cause.  
  
After all, it’s important to get to the root of the problem.  
Rather than being constantly attacked by and fighting against the
unknown, it would be better not to be attacked by such things in the
first place.  
Whether that sect controls dragons or Living Mail is questionable, but I
don't think Carrie's attacks are just coincidence…  
So.  
  
"Be careful."  
"Yes! ...I'm very sad. I really enjoyed myself."  
"Mhm. It was fun for me too."  
  
The next morning, Carrie set off for the capital with Count Gaillard and
numerous escorting soldiers.  
There were two carriages. Count Gaillard was in the front, and Carrie in
the rear. Count Gaillard was already in his carriage, and the soldiers
were in their positions.  
I said goodbye to Carrie before she boarded.  
  
"Call me if you're in trouble."  
  
I nodded encouragingly to Carrie.  
  
"I’ll come immediately."  
“……Y-yes!”  
"Also, here."  
"Eh, eh...?"  
"Use these if you're in trouble."  
  
With that, I handed her a bag.  
The bag contained the following items: \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\],
\[Substitute Doll\], \[Evasion Talisman (Exceptional)\], \[Flash
Stone\], and \[Fireworks Stone\]. The bag ended up larger than I
expected.  
In case of emergency, I chose items prioritizing Carrie’s escape over
fighting.  
  
"If you drink this, you'll feel better. If you have this, it will become
a substitute for you."  
"R-Reni, please wait a moment!"  
  
I was explaining the contents of the bag, but Carrie's worried voice
interrupted me.  
Her face seems busy rapidly changing between red and blue.  
  
"I can't possibly receive such wonderful things…!"  
"No?"  
"No, that's not it! I'm truly overjoyed. However…"  
"Maybe it’s too heavy...?"  
  
I tried to choose items she could carry and easily use, but the
\[Recovery Potion\] is quite heavy. Still, she might be injured and
unable to move, so I'd like her to have one with her.  
  
"This...might not be cute either…"  
  
I had given my father many \[Substitute Dolls\]. He always carried them,
but it might have a bit too much of a folk crafts vibe for a young
girl.  
When I frowned, Carrie thought for a moment... and then cried out, "No
way!"  
  
"It's not heavy at all!"  
  
Carrie took the bag from me and lifted it firmly.  
  
"This is also wonderful!"  
  
She took out the \[Substitute Doll\] and hugged it tightly.  
Mmn. It seems she'll accept them.  
  
"Good."  
  
So I laughed.  
Then, Carrie smiled with relief.  
  
"I'll explain again. If you bury this in the ground, the enemy will
disappear."  
"This one, is it? Understood."  
  
I'd used the \[Evasion Talisman (Special)\] to conceal my parents' home.
If Carrie uses it during an escape, she should be able to disappear.  
  
"This yellow one is pretty, and it glows when you throw it."  
"It glows when you throw it?"  
"Mhm. It's blinding, so it’ll confuse the enemy."  
"I understand."  
  
The yellow stone is a \[Flash Stone\]. It's basically a blinding item
that, in games, stuns enemies for several turns. It's small, light, and
easy to use—just throw it.  
"If you throw this red stone, it sends fireworks into the sky."  
"It makes fireworks in the sky?"  
"Mhm. So I’ll know where Carrie is."  
  
The last red stone was a \[Fireworks Stone\]. Throwing it creates
fireworks, marking your location. In the game, you could design the
pattern of the firework yourself. It doesn’t last long, but it’s clearly
visible to those around, and even after it disappears, you can trace it
through local gossip.  
Carrie listened attentively to my explanations. I'm sure she'll put it
to good use, then—  
  
"...Your Highness"  
  
The red-haired knight waited until Carrie and I finished talking before
calling out to her.  
This time, I wasn’t reprimanded for “rudeness.” Instead—  
  
"I would like permission to kneel before someone other than Your
Highness."  
"P-Pio! Yes, of course. I don't mind!"  
  
The red-haired knight knelt before me, performing the same one-knee bend
Samyu always does.  
Startled, she gently took my right hand…  
  
"I behaved improperly the other day, not knowing you well."  
  
Then, just like that, she pressed her forehead gently against my hand.  
  
"I apologize."  
  
When she was done, crimson eyes gazed earnestly at me.  
  
"...Is your shoulder still hurting from when I pushed you?"  
  
It must have been when the red-haired knight came between me and Carrie.
I didn’t feel any pain.  
  
"Don't worry."  
  
So when I nodded that there was no problem, the red-haired knight let
out a sigh of relief.  
And then she looked at me again.  
  
"You brought a smile to Her Highness’ face. And you have been protecting
her this whole time. Thank you very much."  
"Mhm."  
  
It’s clear that the red-haired knight truly cherishes Carrie.  
  
"Please call me Pio."  
"I’m Reni."  
  
We introduced ourselves to each other again. Then, I took the red-haired
knight, Pio's hand, and asked her to stand up.  
If she stays on her knees for too long, I’m sure it’ll start to hurt.  
  
"Then, Reni, until next time."  
"Reni! See you again!!"  
  
Carrie boarded her carriage and Pio mounted her horse.  
  
"See you again!"  
  
I waved goodbye...  
Then, I turned back to Samyu, who had been waiting patiently.  
  
"Well then, let's go to that village!"  
"Yes!"  
  
A village where rumors of missing children are unnaturally absent.  
Let’s go!
