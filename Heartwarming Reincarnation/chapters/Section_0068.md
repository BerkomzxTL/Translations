# Chapter 68・An Unexpected Visitor…

The scenery whizzed by.  
I was being held by Samyu, enjoying the view, but sleepiness was
creeping up on me again.  
Part of it was the trust and comfort I feel with Samyu, but I guess
something is wrong with my body after all.  
I've just woken up, and yet I'm already feeling so sleepy… This won't
do.  
  
"Lady Reni, are you feeling sleepy again?"  
"Mhm."  
  
Samyu seemed to sense the change in me and called out immediately.  
There was no point in lying, so I answered honestly. Her grip on me
tightened.  
  
"…I'll hurry."  
  
Saying that, Samyu kicked off the ground hard. In an instant, the world
sped up even more. She had said that was her fastest speed before, but
it felt like she’d gotten even faster. Samyu is amazing.  
Then, suddenly, a beautiful voice rang out.  
  
"You elves there! Wait!"  
  
The direction the voice came from was…  
  
"Hmm?"  
  
I rubbed my drowsy eyes and looked up at the sky.  
It was backlit, so I could only see a silhouette. All I could see was
long flowing hair, wings like a pterosaur, and a thick tail.  
  
"Give me back my jewel!!"  
  
The owner of the voice, who had flown through the air, stood in front of
Samyu and me. They landed about 10 meters ahead of us.  
Their face, previously obscured by the backlighting in the air, was now
clearly visible.  
Long black hair, sharp purple eyes. About 10 years old? The most
striking features were the black wings sprouting from her back and the
thick black tail extending from her rear.  
I never would have expected a visitor to show up during our journey. And
from the tone of her voice, it was clear she had business with us.  
To such a visitor, Samyu―  
  
"You're in the way!"  
"Buehgeh!?"  
  
―She didn't stop, and ran straight into her.  
  
"Eh…?"  
  
―Twinkle  
  
As a result, the girl who appeared became a star…  
Encounter time: a mere 20 seconds…  
  
"Samyu… just now…"  
"It was nothing!"  
"Eh, but … she called us elves…?"  
"It was nothing!"  
  
Samyu declared with unwavering eyes.  
It was nothing… huh…  
  
"Judging by her appearance, she’s probably some kind of beastkin or
something. Even from the air, she surpassed my top speed. I may have
blown her away a little forcefully, but I believe she has the strength
to take care of herself."  
"Mmn."  
  
The visitor probably never expected Samyu to run straight into her. She
clearly let out a surprised cry before being blown away.  
But as Samyu said, she has wings, and seemed capable of handling it. If
she’s safe, that's fine…  
But there was something else she said that bothered me.  
  
"She knew about the jewel."  
  
That’s right. The visitor had said, "Give me back my jewel," I think.  
So she knew I had the jewel, and that she was the original owner. That
means…  
  
"Dragon?"  
  
The jewel I obtained in this world was found in the hidden room of the
\[Spirit Cave\] after defeating the dragon there, and then digging a
hole in the floor with the \[Pickaxe (Legendary)\]. Here, Samyu had
distracted the dragon in the \[Spirit Cave\] while my father found it in
the hidden room.  
The dragon, who lost the jewel, was incited by Gaillard and attacked
Carrie. And I turned that dragon into a star, but…  
  
"An acquaintance, maybe?"  
  
Of that Earth Dragon.  
  
"She had wings and a tail."  
  
Black wings and a thick tail. It certainly sounds like a dragon. Samyu
suggested the possibility of a beastkin, but could they be a
dragonkin?  
Hmm, I thought to myself.  
Then, Samyu, without stopping for even a step, began to speak slowly.  
  
"Lady Reni, let's think about that later."  
"Later?"  
"She might appear again. We can think about it then. For now, let's
focus on stopping your \[Mana Rampage\]. It will still take some time to
reach the Elven Forest. We'll take a break to eat on the way, but we’ll
keep going like this. Just as you're feeling increasingly sleepy, I can
sense that your internal mana is also increasing. Please rest for
now."  
"…Mhm."  
  
That’s certainly true.  
We were talking about the jewel, and I wanted to somehow organize the
information, but my head isn't working properly. It feels like when I
had a high fever from a cold.  
  
"Lady Reni…"  
  
Samyu’s worried voice.  
She didn’t slow down, but I could feel the strength of her grip and how
she was running to keep me from being shaken as much as possible.  
Samyu is good at pampering me.  
  
"Okay. I'll sleep again."  
"Yes!"  
"Samyu, don’t push yourself."  
"It's absolutely no problem! With the happiness of holding Lady Reni, I
can keep running!!"  
"Thank you."  
  
After being pampered by Samyu, I closed my eyes and dozed off again.  
I repeated the cycle of sleeping and waking. I felt a little better when
I woke up. At that point, we took a break in the shade of a tree once to
have lunch.  
Other than that, Samyu kept running, and by the time she stopped, it was
already evening. The orange sunset was falling, and the sky was turning
purple.  
By the way—  
  
"You elves there!! I told you to wait!! What kind of attitude is it to
blow me away!? —Ghgg!?"  
"What is this really?! Can't you hear me!? —Wait, wait, I said
—Buhghgg!?"  
"I really… really wish you'd wait… at least, at the very least please
let me speak —Bhehghgg!?"  
  
―The visitor appeared several times, and each time she was blown away by
Samyu.  
  
I think she was crying towards the end. But Samyu kept declaring, "It’s
nothing!"  
Because of my sleepiness, I didn't stop her…  
Since I realized she’d come back unharmed after being blown away, I also
found myself thinking towards the end that maybe it was okay.  
And so, after blowing away the visitor several times, we arrived at a
place where tall, large trees grew densely.  
  
"Lady Reni, this is the Elven Forest."
