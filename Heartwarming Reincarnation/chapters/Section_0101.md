# Chapter 101・Into the Light

Before I knew it, I found myself crying out loud and clinging to
Samyu.  
As I cried, my chest grew warm.  
This is… a jewel. I see, the one who created this world is…  
  
“Jewel.”  
  
When I called out, the jewel appeared. Light spun out from the center of
the sphere, layer upon layer… as if weaving a world.  
  
“Did you grant my wish…?”  
  
As if answering my question, it flickered faintly. Yes. That must be
it.  
  
“The jewel transformed the Elf Queen into a human, and it was passed
down to her child. The jewel's power was used to seal the Queen's mana
and her child's mana. But when the seal was broken, the jewel had
nowhere left to use its power.”  
  
I nodded, “Mhm,” to Samyu’s explanation.  
The jewel must have had excess power from the moment my seal was
broken.  
And when I had a \[Mana Rampage\], the jewel almost disappeared with
me.  
Normally, if I disappeared, the jewel should have remained in the world.
Why was it about to disappear with me? It was because—  
  
“—The jewel was trying to create a world.”  
  
The jewel that had been with me all along.  
It must have noticed the wish deep within my heart… a wish I hadn’t even
realized myself, the wish to ‘live a normal life in Japan,’... to ‘do
things properly.’  
“This world was created anew with just that one jewel… Seven jewels
support the world. No one ever thought that a single jewel alone could
create a new world.”  
“...Yeah.”  
  
The power of the jewel is far too strong.  
…Maybe it was because of my mother’s desires, my aptitude, and the
bottomless amount of mana I possessed.  
My mother had the greatest mana capacity of any Elf Queen in history.
When she wished to become human, all her mana was absorbed into the
jewel. And so, I was born at level cap. The amount of mana I had was off
the charts. The jewel was always with me.  
  
“Is everything okay in that world? Hamu said it would be troublesome if
the jewel disappeared…”  
  
Yes, she said the world would end if even one of the seven was missing.
Now, the jewel with me has granted my wish and created a new world. That
means one jewel is missing from the other world, doesn’t it?  
  
“It’s alright. The dragon is supporting it now.”  
“Hamu?”  
“I don’t really want to praise her, but it could only be the Black
Bahamut Dragon. The moment the incident occurred in \[The Forest of
Reflection\] and the world cracked, she immediately rebuilt it. It seems
to be holding up for now.”  
“For now…?”  
  
Samyu’s phrasing was unsettling.  
It's as if there's no future...that's how she put it.  
I looked into Samyu's black eyes inquisitively. She lowered her eyebrows
sadly.  
  
“...At first, I came to bring you back.”  
“...Mhm.”  
“With the power of the Black Bahamut Dragon. Using its inverse scale as
a medium, I could send myself to this world. The plan was to stop the
jewel’s rampage, and return to the original world. Then, the jewels
would become seven again, and the world would regain peace. That’s how
it should have worked.”  
  
After saying that, Samyu narrowed her eyes gently.  
  
“But, seeing you in this world… I thought maybe this world would be
fine. You were smiling. If this is what you wish for, then I want to
make it come true."  
“Samyu…”  
“I… chose to hide everything… Even if the Black Bahamut Dragon’s power
isn’t enough and the other world perishes. Because your smile is the
most important thing to me.”  
  
And then she let out a sigh.  
  
“However, I was indeed shallow. You always take the most wonderful
choice, surpassing my shortsightedness.”  
“...Mhm.”  
“You realized it yourself and spoke to me so straightforwardly. It’s
impressive.”  
“...Because, Samyu. If I didn’t notice, Samyu would suffer silently.”  
  
Samyu grew up and lived in that other world for a long time. She has
many precious things there. And she should've had a mission to carry the
weight of the world on her shoulders, to bring me back.  
Yet, she was willing to sacrifice everything to fulfill my single wish.
That’s just…  
And the path I'll choose, having heard all this, is only one.  
  
“—I’ll end this world.”  
  
A world where my dream came true. But I can’t choose this world.  
Samyu hugged me tightly.  
  
“I… still think this world is fine…. After hearing my story, there’s no
other choice. But…”  
“Thank you… for coming all the way here… For helping me in this world
too."  
  
I'm so happy…  
I went to school properly, ate lunch with friends, and my parents
weren’t sighing.  
  
“But… I…”  
  
Because I… died on Christmas night.  
I lived an unhealthy lifestyle with little sleep and didn’t care about
my health at all. I don’t know the exact cause of death, but I think I
was living such a life where it wouldn't have been surprising if I
died.  
  
But… if I had lived.  
If I had played a lot of games and used the experience I gained…  
  
“This kind of future… might have existed.”  
  
Without Samyu things wouldn’t go this smoothly. Even if I went to
school, I probably wouldn’t make friends right away, and I might have
ended up a shut-in again.  
But…The fact that I was able to think like that.  
The fact that I could believe in the possibility of a slightly brighter
future, not just stagnation. That will stay with me forever.  
  
Everything might not have been completely normal. But maybe I could go
to a correspondence high school. Get the qualifications to take the
university entrance exam… become a university student.  
Maybe, maybe, maybe.  
I can see many futures. For me, a hikikomori high school girl, there are
many paths.  
―Paths that I, who died, can no longer take.  
  
“Thank you.”  
  
Thank you for showing me so many possibilities.  
  
“Jewel.”  
  
I spoke to that which wove light.  
Then, the light intensified.  
  
“—Let’s go home.”  
  
I could feel my form changing within the light.  
With a smaller body, I looked up at the person beside me.  
There stood a girl with golden hair and blue eyes. A very cute elf
girl.  
  
“Let’s go, Samyu.”  
“Yes, Lady Reni!”
