# Chapter 21・Elf Girl

Why do I always end up like this?  
I spilled a \[Recovery Potion\] on my father, dropped \[Fertilizer\] in
the field, and spilled all sorts of things, and now I've dropped
documents as well...  
I knew it. I knew I should have put the documents in my item box.  
It was a mistake to think I'd sort them out after leaving the basement
and then put them in the item box.  
I considered sorting the documents in the basement, but there's only one
way up, and there's no way to escape. I didn't want to stay there for
too long, so I thought it would be safer to sort them on the first
floor.  
I thought I could manage it for the short time between the basement and
the first floor. I never imagined I'd jump too high and send the
documents flying…  
…But it's okay. There’s no problem.  
It’s important to reflect on your mistakes so you don’t repeat them;
rather I can use that experience to improve for next time. Failure is
normal even in games. What matters is learning from it.  
—That's right! I can just pick up the documents again!  
  
“Phew…”  
  
As I was reassuring myself, a voice, as if relieved from the bottom of
her heart, could be heard.  
It was from the girl who had caught me.  
Yeah, she's probably not an enemy.  
If she harbored ill intentions, my \[Detection Bell\] would have rung,
and she wouldn't have such a concerned voice or arms that would be
gently embracing me.  
  
"Thank you."  
  
For the time being, it seems I'm not in danger. So, while thanking her,
I took another look at the girl.  
She looks a little younger than my previous life's self. She has glossy
golden hair and bright blue eyes. Her face is incredibly beautiful, like
a model's.  
That girl is looking at me with adoring eyes.  
Reassurance, happiness, and joy.  
I can sense it from the way she looks down at me, and I can’t help but
become captivated.  
She's so cute… My mother is the most beautiful woman I've ever met, but
if we're talking about girls, this girl is the most beautiful.  
And her ears are slightly pointed—  
  
"...Elf?"  
"Yes. My race is Elf."  
  
An elf! That means you're just like me!  
...We’re the same, right?  
Questioning this, I let go of the documents with one hand and touched my
ears – the ones that aren't cat ears.  
Yep. Round. Not pointy at all. Completely human ears.  
…But my status says 'Elf'.  
I furrowed my brow.  
Then the girl hurriedly put me down on the floor.  
  
"I-I apologize!"  
  
And then, kneeling on one knee on the wooden floor, she bent down.  
It's like a knight's salute—  
  
"...It is an honor to meet you."  
  
The girl looked up at me with shining blue eyes.  
...That said, I'm short, so we're almost at eye level.  
And why is she so reverent?  
Clutching the documents in both hands, I tilted my head.  
The girl nodded knowingly.  
  
"I have been looking forward to the day I could meet Lady Reni."  
"Meet me? You know my name?"  
"Yes. I heard from your mother."  
"Mama."  
  
I see, from my mother!  
一I nodded in understanding for a moment, then shook my head.  
Why is there a connection between my mother and this elf girl?  
After all, my mother's ears are round too…  
  
"...Lady Reni doesn't know anything yet, does she?"  
  
The elf girl seemed to understand a lot from my expression, and smiled
somewhat painfully.  
A faint shadow flickered in her vivid blue eyes.  
That tightened my chest, and I let go of the documents with one hand,
gently reaching out.  
Right where my gaze was. I stroked her glossy golden hair gently.  
  
"It's okay."  
"L-Lady Reni!"  
"Leave it to Reni."  
  
I don't know what I don't know, but it'll probably be alright.  
After all, I'm the strongest three-year-old!  
"It's alright," I said, nodding and puffing out my chest.  
Then, the elf girl made a sound like something was steaming; her cheeks
flushed with embarrassment.  
  
"It's an honor… I… I never thought this day would come… To be touched by
your hand… so cute, so wonderful…"  
  
Tears started falling one after another.  
  
"Ah, are you okay?"  
"Y-yes, I'm fine… I'm sorry… I've been… waiting for this day… for so
long…"  
"Mhm."  
"My whole life... I wondered if the day I could meet you... would never
come..."  
"Mhm."  
"And yet, I'm showing you such an undignified sight…"  
  
Still kneeling on one knee, with her back straight, the elf girl seemed
to be desperately trying to stop crying.  
  
"I wanted to… to greet you more properly…"  
"Mhm."  
  
The elf girl and I are meeting for the first time.  
I don't understand at all why it ended up like this.  
But I understand it's something very important to the elf girl.  
Therefore—  
  
"You were cool."  
  
I gently stroked her head again.  
  
"You caught Reni earlier."  
  
Right?  
  
"You were cool."  
  
Tears spilled from her bright blue eyes.  
I gently wiped them with the back of my \[Cat's Paw Gloves\].  
  
"I'm truly happy."  
  
And then, so that my feelings would be conveyed, I firmly met her
gaze―  
  
"Ah, I can't. It's too much. It’s impossible."  
  
The elf girl said that and fainted.
