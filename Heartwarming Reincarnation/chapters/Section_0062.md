# Chapter 62・Reni Is a Genius 3 (2)

Carrie’s words were strong and direct.  
Gaillard clapped his hands.  
  
"Magnificent. As expected of Her Highness the Princess. Compared to His
Highness the Crown Prince and Her Highness the Princess (older sister),
your appearance and abilities may be inferior, but your pride is truly
admirable."  
“……!”  
  
Carrie felt a sharp pain in her chest, as if being gripped tightly, at
Gaillard’s words.  
She had ordinary brown hair and brown eyes. Her limbs weren't
particularly long. She didn’t have a photographic memory, nor was she
quick-witted. In terms of physical abilities, she knew she was worse
than other children her age.  
Gaillard was close to Carrie.  
Therefore, he knew of her capabilities and her inferiority complex.  
  
“If you remain in this kingdom, Your Highness will continue to be
treated as someone insignificant and lacking in ability. How long can
you maintain that pride? Come with me. I know. Your Highness is a child
of God. You possess that power.”  
“I…”  
  
—I am not a child of God.  
  
"I certainly lack ability."  
  
The only power Gaillard acknowledged wasn't Carrie's.  
Just a plain, incompetent princess.  
Carrie knew this better than anyone.  
  
“But…”  
  
I have nothing.  
Even though I don't possess a single outstanding quality.  
  
“I will not lose this pride!”  
  
She was born and raised as royalty.  
No matter how weak, she wouldn't let that be sullied  
For the sake of the people, for the sake of the children here now,
Carrie wouldn't yield to Gaillard.  
  
“Gaillard, you are wrong. I will not go with you! Release the
children!”  
  
Gaillard shrugged at Carrie’s declaration.  
Then he called out to the Living Mail waiting by the wall.  
  
“Capture her.”  
  
Responding to the command, the Living Mail began to move.  
Carrie resisted, but as a child, she was helpless and quickly
captured.  
She was then brought to the center of the room.  
  
“Do you know what’s here?”  
  
Both arms were caught by the Living Mail, and no matter how much she
struggled, it wouldn't budge.  
Carrie didn’t answer, and glared at Gaillard.  
  
“The place Your Highness is standing is the center of a magic circle. I
analyzed the large magic circle in Rewander and made some modifications.
I made it possible to use the power of Rewander’s Jewel remotely. The
power is weak, but it’s enough to erase a human body.”  
  
Gaillard looked down at Carrie and spoke eloquently.  
  
“The king who sought immortality considered erasing the body and
affixing the soul to an object. Now, Your Highness, where do you think
your Jewel resides? —In your soul. It exists within your soul.”  
  
His face was calm.  
  
“I learned from Riwander’s Jewel that it’s passed down from parent to
child. That means I can’t possess the Jewel myself. Therefore, if I
erase the body of a child possessing the Jewel and leave only the soul,
wouldn't the Jewel emerge?”  
  
Gaillard’s expression vanished after saying that.  
  
“This is unconfirmed. Therefore, it shouldn’t be used. Your Highness. I
served you as a mere Count, despite being royalty. I always wondered.
Why is a child of royalty with such insignificant ability before me?”  
  
This is the first time she’s seen Gaillard’s expression like this.  
It was not his usual calm one, but twisted and ugly.  
  
“It seems I despised you more than I thought.”  
  
He had always been with her.  
She thought he had been supporting her.  
That he saw her trying her best…  
  
“Whether Your Highness’s soul remains as a Jewel, disappears entirely,
or becomes a ghoul, I don’t know. What I do know is that I will no
longer have to hear your voice.”  
  
Gaillard said this, then placed his hands on the floor.  
He was adding words to the magic circle.  
Then—  
  
“Farewell.”  
  
—With a calm voice, the magic circle drawn on the floor emitted light.  
  
“……!”  
  
In the golden light, Carrie steeled her resolve.  
This is the end.  
But, will the children be alright?  
She thought she managed to throw the \[Fireworks Stone\] and let Reni
know of her location. And she managed to stall and draw attention to
herself.  
Reni will manage. Believing that, Carrie closed her eyes—  
  
“Kuh…?! What is this…?”  
  
A jolt of electricity ran through her body, converging in her chest
before dissipating.  
The magic circle’s glow vanished, and the golden world returned to its
original color.  
  
“It should have activated, why is she alive?”  
  
Gaillard looked at Carrie with a face of astonishment.  
At that moment, something fell from Carrie’s pocket.  
It was—  
  
“A doll…?”  
  
A \[Substitute Doll\] charred black.  
Carrie had stuffed Reni’s gift into her pocket.  
  
“Reni…”  
  
Carrie, insignificant and lacking in ability.  
But Reni said her hair was cute, and her eyes were beautiful.  
Reni acknowledged her efforts after seeing her curtsy.  
  
—She became her friend.  
  
“……Reni”  
  
I want to see her again.  
I want to laugh with her again.  
  
“Help…”  
  
She whispered.  
At that moment, with a roar, the ceiling of the basement collapsed.  
Strong light streamed into the underground facility. Along with that
light appeared—  
  
“Sorry I’m late.”
