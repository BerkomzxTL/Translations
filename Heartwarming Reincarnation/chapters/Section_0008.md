# Chapter 8・I Understand Why We’re Poor

It’s already been a year since I first fertilized the field and spread
the nutrient-rich soil.  
I’m three years old now.  
Up until now I’ve had a strong baby-like vibe, but I recently became a
toddler. The word "child" suits me better.  
As for the field, it’s looking quite nice.  
Initially, the harvest of potatoes, carrots, and onions was poor.  
But now, a single potato plant yields twenty potatoes, the carrots are
sweet and mellow, and the onions are large and perfectly plump. The
Guora family’s vegetables are so popular with the neighbors now that
they’re always praising their deliciousness.  
Furthermore, we’re getting to harvest a lot of S-rank materials.  
When the first S-rank material, \[Medicinal Herbs (Special)\], sprouted
in the field, my mother screamed, and father built a fence around that
part of the field to hide it from view.  
Apparently, it’s not good for ordinary households to have S-rank
materials growing in their fields.  
My parents concealed the fact that we were harvesting S-rank materials,
pretending my father, a hunter, had collected them in the forest. He
sells them through his connections to a tool shop.  
My mother harvests and dries the \[Medicinal Herbs (special)\],
\[Sleeping Grass (special)\], \[Explosive Flowers (special)\], and other
S-rank materials that grow in the field, and my father sells them. This
has generated a significant amount of money.  
I think I’ve now completed everything I initially planned to do.  
  
\* To make my father healthy.  
\* To enrich the field and secure a source of income.  
  
Therefore, my family should have been able to escape poverty… but…  
  
"Just like I thought, still poor..."  
  
Terrifyingly, we haven't gotten any richer. Our poverty continues.  
Why is our family poor? I've conducted an investigation to the best of
my ability. What I've found is――  
  
“It’s like we’re in debt.”  
  
That’s right. Apparently, my parents owe someone money, and it seems
they're having trouble making ends meet with the repayments and
everything else.  
But, does that kind of thing really happen?  
My healthy, young parents work tirelessly, selling the S-rank materials
from the field, and with a bountiful harvest of vegetables, we never
lack food. And yet, they can't pay off their debts…  
I suspect they went into debt after my father fell ill. It’s unlikely
that two hard-working people would have fallen into debt and taken out
loans before I was born.  
It was probably around the time my father got sick and my mother
couldn’t work yet – about a month after I was born. That period seems
suspicious.  
It’s reasonable to assume my family ran out of money around then,
leading either my father or mother to take out a loan, the repayment of
which continues to this day.  
  
“... feels like someone's deceiving us.”  
  
Right? I strongly suspect my parents have been tricked or manipulated in
some way.  
That’s why when someone violently pounded on our door, I thought, ah,
they've finally come.  
  
“Hey! Open the door! We know you’re in there!”  
“Pay back the money you owe!!”  
  
—Clearly, debt collectors, not ordinary people, have arrived.
