# Chapter 33・We Made a Guardian Contract

"Here we go!"  
"Okay!"  
  
The moment I spoke, Samyu leapt out the window.  
Thanks to her enhanced body from \[Mana Manipulation\], Samyu defied
gravity and didn't fall to the ground. Feeling the wind on my cheeks,
she quickly reached the roof of the house next door, which was far
away.  
  
"So fast!"  
"Lady Reni, aren't you scared?"  
"Not scared! It's fun!!"  
  
The sensation of floating and the speed are exhilarating, and I couldn't
help but laugh. Samyu smiled happily and flew off to the next roof.  
We advanced by jumping from roof to roof, unnoticed by anyone.  
Illuminated by the twinkling starlight, it felt like only Samyu and I
existed in this world.  
I feel so happy...so excited.  
With Samyu, it feels like we could do anything—  
  
“…Lady Reni. After spending the day with you, I realized… your power is
far stronger than I imagined, and you can do everything by yourself…
that's what I felt.”  
  
As she moved to the next roof, Samyu began to speak slowly.  
  
“I… hope to be of assistance to Lady Reni. However, I'm worried that
I'll just be a burden to you if I stay like this... If that's the case,
then I―"  
  
Samyu was about to say something… but stopped halfway. I looked up,
wondering what was going on, and saw that she had a pained look on her
face.  
  
"Samyu."  
  
I couldn't bear to see that face, so I gently reached out my hand.  
  
"Reni, is strong, but sometimes makes mistakes."  
  
That's right. I'm strong, but I also make mistakes. If I think I have a
good idea, I immediately put it into action right away, but I often
overdo things and get carried away… Even if I fail, I can try again, and
if it works out in the end, that's fine. I don't think everything I do
is wrong.  
But—  
  
"Samyu, helps me."  
  
Having Samyu around makes me feel so much stronger.  
一Being with her makes me excited.  
Therefore.  
  
"Guardian Contract."  
  
A ritual that only elves can perform, strengthening the bond between
them.  
Samyu's guardian is my mother, and they can perform \[Telepathy\]
between them.  
Samyu, who made a contract with my mother, the Queen, told me that her
dream was to become the guardian of a child born from my mother.  
Since I am that child, making a contract would fulfill Samyu's dream.  
I want to make Samyu's dream come true.  
And not just that, I also…  
  
"I want to do it with Samyu."  
  
If such a cool, strong, and wonderful girl spent time with me, it would
surely be the best.  
But there’s one problem.  
  
"Reni's ears are round, so it might not work."  
  
Yes. My status type is listed as \[Elf\], but in reality, I look human.
I’ve never been able to use mana, so there's no doubt that it’s sealed
away.  
So, it might not be possible to make a Guardian Contract.  
Hmm, tilting my head, Samyu stopped dead in her tracks.  
  
"Samyu?"  
"Oh… L-Lady Reni… are you… really… alright… with this…?"  
  
A trembling voice.  
  
"A Guardian Contract can only be made once. Once you choose someone, you
can never change it."  
  
Samyu hugged me tightly.  
  
“I already belong to Lady Reni. I was born for Lady Reni, and I have
decided in my heart that I will live for Lady Reni. Therefore, there is
no need to rush into choosing a guardian. …There are stronger and more
beautiful elves. Of course, I don't intend to lose, but I think Lady
Reni should have more choices.”  
  
Samyu said this and bit her lip.  
...I think this is what I like about Samyu.  
She has a dream she wants to fulfill, and it seems like it’s about to
come true. But instead of jumping in, she explained things thoroughly to
me first. She explained things to me in a way that suits me as a child,
and is giving me the freedom to make a choice.  
…I once again found myself thinking that Samyu is wonderful.  
Therefore, I still—  
  
"Samyu is the one."  
  
I put my arm around Samyu's neck.  
Pulling myself up, even though I’m small, I reached Samyu’s ear.  
  
"Samyu is the one."  
  
So she could hear me clearly.  
I whispered it again near her ear.  
Then Samyu trembled—  
  
“…Understood. Then I must prepare the location. Although I don’t think
there’s a place in this dilapidated town that is suitable for Lady Reni,
I will prepare the best place possible.”  
"……Samyu?"  
  
Eh? Something about her atmosphere is different...? She’s usually a
gentle, composed girl, but now she seems… intense. Her eyes are filled
with determination. Eh?  
  
"Nowhere is suitable for Lady Reni… ah, there's the clock tower. It
stands on a hill, the tallest building in this area, so that might be
good. Instead of searching for a crude structure made by humans, we
should look out onto the vast grasslands and have the starry sky as our
backdrop… yes. Lady Reni standing there would be magnificent.”  
"Samyu…"  
"Lady Reni, let's go."  
"……Mmn"  
  
I wonder what happened. I don't feel like I can say anything anymore.
Her arms around me are as gentle as always, but her atmosphere is
drastically different.  
With her eyes filled with determination, Samyu said that and kicked off
the roof. Our destination is the clock tower. It’s tower-like, and when
you reached the top, you can see the entire area.  
  
"...Beautiful."  
  
The view from the tall clock tower on the hill is breathtaking.  
The lights from the houses in the town were shining brightly, with an
orange glow. The grasslands beyond were illuminated by starlight, their
leaves glistening.  
  
"I'll set you down."  
  
As I was captivated by the scenery, Samyu carefully lowered me onto the
scaffolding. We were in front of a large clock, probably a place for
conducting maintenance.  
It’s spacious and stable, so even though it’s high up, it's not scary.  
  
"Lady Reni."  
  
Samyu’s earnest voice. Prompted by her, I shifted my gaze from the
scenery to Samyu. Just then, a gentle breeze blew, and my hood came
off.  
  
"May I perform the Guardian Contract here?"  
"Mhm. Let's do it here… but if the contract doesn’t work… it might be
meaningless…"  
"No. It will have meaning. The actual effect of the contract is not the
issue. …Lady Reni and I will have made a Guardian Contract. That is a
fact."  
"……Mhm"  
  
After saying that, Samyu knelt down and gently took my right hand.  
And she looked at me with piercing, bright blue eyes.  
  
"I, Samyu Arumu, contract as the guardian of Reni Shurm Guora. I swear
to protect you with my body and my life, to the very end.”  
  
Samyu said this and gently lifted my hand. Then, she brought her lips to
my palm—  
  
"Samyu…"  
  
A soft touch. And from it, I could feel Samyu's determination. At the
pleading touch, I involuntarily cried out.  
  
"I apologize, Lady Reni. For the contract, it is necessary to kiss a
part of the other person."  
"I see… sorry, I was surprised."  
"How is it? Do you feel anything?"  
  
Samyu asked me that, and I suddenly realized that my right palm was
warm.  
And it was gradually spreading throughout my body.  
  
"It's warm."  
"That's good…"  
"I should return this, right?"  
"Eh!?"  
  
I think we should both do it, since it’s a contract.  
So, I hugged Samyu tightly while she was kneeling. In this position, her
face was close to mine.  
  
"Reni Shurm Guora. I declare Samyu Arumu my guardian. Let's do lots of
fun things together."  
  
After saying that, I gently pulled away so I could see Samyu’s face.  
Then—  
  
"I love you."  
  
Chuu.  
I kissed her eyelids, protecting those bright blue eyes.  
Since she has two eyes, I did it twice, not just once.  
Then, I gently parted my lips and laughed softly.  
  
"How is it? Is Samyu warm too?"  
  
If it's warm, I’ll take it as proof that the Guardian Contract was
successful.  
That's why I asked properly, but Samyu stopped moving… Oh no.  
  
"Ah, no way, precious, impossible, ultimate weapon."  
  
Saying that, her eyes rolled again—  
  
"No! Samyu! If you collapse here!"  
"Preciou…s…"  
"Samyu!"  
  
—If she faints, she'll fall!!!
