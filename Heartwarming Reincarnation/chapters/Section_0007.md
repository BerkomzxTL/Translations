# Chapter 7・My Child Is a Genius

The night Reni sprinkled soil with a ladle. The usually busy couple had
a rare moment of leisure.  
Three chairs at their four-person dining table. The couple sat opposite
each other, sipping warm water from their cups and sighing
contentedly.  
  
"Reni is a strange girl, isn't she?"  
"She is."  
"When she was born, she cried heartily, but she hardly cried after that.
When she's hungry or her diaper is wet, she just makes a small 'aaah'
sound, barely a disturbance…"  
"Ah, yes. She'd let us know it was milk time in perfect three-hour
intervals, like she could read a clock."  
  
The two were thinking about their beloved daughter, Reni, who was
currently asleep in her bed.  
Their first child. The couple was savoring the happiness of pregnancy
and childbirth. But then—  
  
"Because I got injured, and fell ill…"  
"A hunter's job is dangerous. It's not your fault it happened. I'm
really glad you're feeling better now."  
"...I feel so pathetic. While you were out working, I just laid in bed,
and only when Reni told me the time did I give her the goat's milk the
bakery shared with us."  
"If you're going to say that, then I… I couldn't do anything for Reni at
all…"  
  
The couple recalled the past, falling into a pensive mood.  
And at times like this, the two of them always came to the same
conclusion.  
  
"Honestly, I'm so glad Reni was born."  
"Yes, me too."  
"I really think I wouldn't have been able to overcome the hardships if
it weren't for Reni."  
"Reni is the best daughter."  
  
The two of them talked like this, laughing together. Then the wife
exclaimed, "Ah!"  
  
"Today, Reni asked for something she wanted for the first time."  
"Oh really? What did she want?"  
"Something to dig with… probably a shovel? That's what she seemed to
want."  
"A shovel… but we don't have one…"  
"Exactly… So I was thinking I'd apologize to Reni and get her one
someday as a present, but Reni ran off in the middle of my
explanation."  
"...I wonder if she felt sad because you couldn't grant her first ever
wish?"  
  
The husband looked pained, imagining Reni's feelings. But the wife shook
her head, saying no.  
  
"I thought so at first too. But when Reni came back, she had a ladle in
her hand."  
"A ladle?"  
"Yes. She said she found it around the house… But I don't think a ladle
would ever be lying around our property, and the ladle Reni had looked
very high-quality."  
"That's—magic?"  
"...Probably."  
  
The wife answered seriously, mirroring her husband's serious
expression.  
  
"I thought Reni was a water-attribute mage, but… she might have even
greater powers."  
"That’s right."  
"I don't know how to explain it, but I think Reni can use magic to
retrieve things…"  
"Magic to retrieve things, huh…"  
  
The couple didn't know that Reni was the reincarnation of a former high
school girl, and can use status screens and an item box. Reni herself
also didn't realize that her secret was out. However, just by living
with Reni, the couple had gotten remarkably close to the truth about her
abilities. And then—  
  
"Reni is a genius."  
"Yes, a genius."  
  
They accepted it straightforwardly, and praised her honestly. They had
no hesitation in calling their own child a 'genius'. Because for the
couple, it was the truth.  
  
"We have to keep Reni a secret…"  
"Yes… at least until she's a little older…"  
  
The couple said that and nodded to each other.
