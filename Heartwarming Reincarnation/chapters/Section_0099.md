# Chapter 99・It Was All a Dream

I apparently woke up from a nightmare on Christmas night.  
I had fallen asleep looking forward to the game event, and then woke up
immediately afterward. I got out of bed, checked the date, and turned on
my PC. In the end, I couldn't go back to sleep, and morning came.  
School is already on winter break.  
I don’t have enough attendance days, so I had already been told I would
have to repeat the year and was planning to drop out.  
That was probably… a dream. But I still have memories of my time there.
It feels too real to be a dream. But...  
  
"Those days were like a dream..."  
  
That much is certain. I had so much fun and was so happy. Compared to my
current life as a hikikomori high school girl in Japan, I was so
motivated and active.  
  
"To go on a journey at the age of four…"  
  
It was my own decision, but thinking about it now, it's a surprising
one. I had Samyu as a guardian, but even in Japan, if I had said I
wanted to do that, I'm sure I would have been told to wait until I was
older.  
But… my father and mother allowed it. And Samyu came with me.  
The Carrie I met on my journey was dignified as a princess, Pio was a
cool knight, Hasano a magnificent queen, Hamu an admirable dragon, and
Karigano was bright and encouraging to be around.  
  
"Were they all… my imagination?"  
  
—That can't be right.  
I vaguely felt around in my sweatshirt pocket, and something bumped
against my hand…  
  
"Ah, an inverse scale."  
  
When I took it out, it was a black scale. It wasn't shining, but it was
an inverse scale.  
…They were all really there. I think this is proof.  
But, the days passed…  
  
"Well then, I'm off."  
"…Be careful."  
"Shall I see you part of the way?"  
"No, it's okay."  
  
At the beginning of January, after the winter break. I was about to
leave the house to go to high school.  
My parents, who had never expected me to go to school at this point,
called out to me worriedly from the front door.  
…Taking that first step out the front door. I had always been afraid of
this.  
Even if I managed to leave the house, there were many times when I would
stop halfway and be unable to continue.  
My mom and dad… they probably didn't think I would actually make it to
school.  
But… I’m different now.  
  
"I'm going."  
  
My uniform, which I had only worn a few times, is still new. My
designated leather shoes are still shiny.  
I don’t know what subjects I have today. All I have is writing utensils
and a clear file. I put on a mostly empty backpack and went outside. I
feel like I can manage if it's just the opening ceremony.  
  
"It's cold."  
  
A winter morning. The air is cold. I'm wearing a brand-new scarf and
gloves, but the wind hitting my cheeks is still painful.  
Ah…  
  
"The Japanese scenery is…"  
  
Straight white lines on black asphalt. Black wires ran along gray
utility poles, and sparrows with curled-up winter fur were perched
there. I looked up at them, and as I exhaled, my breath became a white
mist.  
  
"…Beautiful."  
  
I was supposed to hate going to school, but my heart is calm.  
For now, I simply feel like I should try going, at least once.  
Maybe it's because I was able to physically be away from the obligation
of going to school for almost four years, or maybe it's because the
memories I have left are strongly influencing my feelings.  
Actually…it's not that I'm not scared.  
Even if I start going to school now, there's no way I could blend into
the class, and I won't understand the lessons. I won't be able to make
friends, I'll probably just get those "What are you doing here?" stares.
But…  
  
"Leave it to me, okay?"  
  
In my memory, I said that energetically, brimming with motivation.  
The person I was then is completely different from the person I am now,
but when I say it out loud, courage seems to well up in my heart.  
Because I might get worn out on my first day back, I left home quite
early. I stopped halfway a few times, but once I got to the nearby bus
stop, it was only one bus ride to high school. A thirty-minute ride, and
I would be at school.  
I was so nervous, my chest was pounding, and cold sweat dripped from my
hands. I had to look down, but I managed to keep moving my feet.  
  
"Leave it to me… leave it to me…"  
  
I murmured it like a charm and moved forward. There's nothing anyone
could possibly leave to someone like me, but just thinking about it
gives me courage.  
I’m glad I left home early.  
There weren't many students yet, so I could get to the main gate at my
own pace. Then, relying on my memory, I walked to the classroom. The
third floor of the west building. Right after going up the stairs.
That's my classroom. 1-5.  
Then… I just have to open the door and enter the classroom.  
…Will my seat still be there?  
I've been absent for a long time. It might be gone already. …What should
I do? Maybe I should have talked to a teacher in the staff room first.
Ah, but if the teacher gives me a bothered look…  
My thoughts swirled.  
Then, suddenly, the door creaked open.  
  
"Good morning."  
  
There was a girl wearing the same uniform as me. She had black hair
braided on both sides, and she looked kind and very cute. A classmate?
If we're in the same class, I might have seen her face before, but I
didn't recognize her, and I don’t know her name.  
  
"A-ah, um, ah… Good morning."  
  
I was surprised, and because I'm shy to begin with, I mumbled as I
returned the greeting.  
Then, the girl smiled kindly.  
  
"Your seat is over here."  
  
She said, guiding me.  
It seems she’s interacting with me knowing I'm a truant classmate.  
  
"Um…sorry."  
  
I caused trouble from the moment I came to school. Apologizing for my
inadequacy made my chest ache. …I wonder if all I can say is "I'm sorry"
after all.  
I kept apologizing and then...  
I was getting swallowed up by dark thoughts again. But, at that
moment—  
  
*'I love you!', 'You can do anything!', 'As expected of you!', ‘You make
me so happy!', 'You saved me', 'You're cute!!', 'I'll come see you
again!', 'It's good to be with you!'*  
  
—I heard everyone's voices.  
I always make mistakes. I'm always causing trouble.  
And…nobody’s perfect either. But I don’t hate that. That's why…  
  
"Um, thank you for being so kind to me…"  
  
Being together with everyone, helping each other.  
It's not about perfect people being together. Even if we make mistakes,
if we can support each other… I…  
My words made the girl smile again.  
  
"Yes. Please speak up if you need anything."  
"A-ah, I… I also… if there's anything I can help with…"  
  
I said that much, sat down in the seat she guided me to, and quickly put
down my backpack.  
There's probably nothing a truant student like me could help with.  
I think it was a presumptuous offer. But I wanted to say it. And now
that I've said it, I'm so overwhelmed, I can't even understand myself
anymore because of the anxiety.  
Even though I'm so suspicious, the girl doesn't seem to be bothered. And
she sat down next to me…  
  
"My name is Shiori."  
"Um…"  
  
When she told me her name, I was surprised, and my eyes wandered.  
But maybe this isn't a bad thing. So, timidly, I looked next to me. The
girl's eyes… weren't annoyed. They were kind, dark eyes.  
That gave me courage, and I responded carefully and respectfully.  
  
"…Shiori-chan?"  
"Yes. We're next to each other. Nice to meet you."  
"A-ah… um, I…"  
  
My name is…  
  
"…Rina."  
"…Rina-san, right?"  
  
The girl… Shiori-chan nodded as she said that.  
And, as if to accommodate my nervousness, she spoke to me slowly.  
Soon, other classmates came to school, and some looked surprised when
they saw me. I also heard some people talking about me.  
"She's coming now," or "She’s repeating the year, isn't she?"  
I’m sure the people saying those things don't… have bad intentions.
They're just confirming the existence of me, something different than
usual.  
  
"Rina-san, the opening ceremony is in the auditorium. Let's go
together."  
"I'm sorry… No, a… thank you."  
  
Shiori-chan spoke to me cheerfully, as if to drown out those voices.  
My habit of apologizing came out without thinking, but I shook my head
slightly and changed it into a thank you. What I wanted to say was…  
Not "I'm sorry for being like this," but… "Thank you for being kind to
me."  
  
"I think there will be a lot of things you're not used to. I'm here if
you need anything."  
  
Shiori-chan said that and smiled kindly.  
The world sparkled brilliantly.  
A winter classroom, a seat in the fifth row from the front by the
window… the kind words of the girl next to me.  
From then on, a school life different from anything I've known before
awaited me.
