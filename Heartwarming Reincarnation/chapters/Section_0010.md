# Chapter 10・I'm Very Angry

Leaving the house, I quickly spotted the debt collectors.  
They seemed to be heading somewhere, leaving our house behind. I quickly
followed them.  
My \[Hermit's Robe\] seems to be working. Even when I got within two
meters of them, they didn't notice my presence.  
  
"Ouch! Damn it!"  
  
Getting that close, I could clearly hear their voices.  
There are three of them. One was holding his shoulder, seemingly injured
from the fight with my father, while the other two were rubbing their
lower backs.  
  
"He's really strong after all."  
"Yeah. We can't win fighting him normally."  
  
The debt collectors were talking about my father, clicking their tongues
in annoyance. Two of them sounded frustrated. But the other one let out
an unpleasant chuckle.  
  
"But wasn't he helpless against the monster? He got hurt protecting his
friends. He had no idea we'd bought them off."  
"Yeah. He fell right into our trap."  
"He should've just died, but he managed to survive…"  
  
At those words, I felt my head clearing. The debt collectors' words made
many things fall into place.  
I see. I thought something was strange.  
I'd been told my father was a skilled hunter. Even from today's fight
with the debt collectors, it's clear he possesses considerable combat
skills.  
So why did he get injured, then fall ill, during what should have been a
normal hunt in his usual hunting grounds?  
It wasn't due to overconfidence or bad luck.  
  
—It was a setup from the beginning.  
  
That's it.  
  
"If he'd died, we would have approached his struggling wife and taken
the child, too."  
"The child was a girl, right? What a shame. We could have sold her for a
good price."  
"What's done is done. Anyway, I’ve made a profit by lending money to the
wife, so it’s all good, isn’t it? We’ll probably get the wife soon
enough.”  
"Speaking of that, he’s supporting his dead friend's family, right? He
feels responsible because he couldn't save him, so he's giving them
money. What an idiot. That friend was bought off by us to sell him
out."  
“We’re the ones who forced him into debt and manipulated him into
selling that guy out.”  
"We were going to kill him anyway, but it’s lucky he was killed by a
monster. Saved us the trouble of silencing him, and even in death, he's
still useful to us!"  
"These villagers are too easy."  
  
The debt collectors exchanged glances and chuckled.  
Hearing their laughter, my anger boiled—  
  
"Item Box"  
  
I muttered softly and selected \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] from the long list
of item names.  
  
"That one."  
  
Appearing on my chest were adorable glove-shaped equipment with fluffy
fur and squishy paw pads: \[Cat's Paw Gloves\].  
Despite its cute appearance, it’s a weapon—a pair of dual blades.  
Crafting the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] requires many SS-grade materials.
Their attack power is incredibly high, and I had used them constantly in
the game.  
Thanks to added materials and layered enhancements, I could defeat most
enemies with one punch, and even the final boss of the main quest could
be defeated in two hits.  
I put them on both hands and squeezed them to check how they felt.  
Yes. It works. I was worried they wouldn't fit my three-year-old hands,
but the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] fit perfectly.  
  
"Excuse me a moment?"  
  
I called out to the debt collectors, removing the hood of my \[Hermit's
Robe\].  
Now they should be able to see me.  
The debt collectors seemed startled by the sudden voice and froze on the
spot.  
  
"Give me the debt receipt."  
  
At my voice, the debt collectors turned around.  
The moment they saw me, they breathed out a sigh, clearly relaxing.  
  
"Hey, it's just a kid."  
"You, go away."  
  
Two of the debt collectors immediately lost interest, waving their hands
dismissively.  
But one of them stared intently at my face—  
  
"Hey, wait. Look, it's amazing!"  
""Huh?""  
  
The debt collectors' gazes focused on me.  
After a moment of blank stares, they swallowed hard.  
  
"It's true… this… this is…"  
  
The debt collectors exchanged glances. The moment they licked their lips
in their hearts was easily understood.  
Is it really this easy to understand?  
My anger intensified at their attitude.  
Unaware of my feelings, the debt collectors showed me a saccharine
smile.  
  
"Little miss, where did you come from? Could you guide us old men?"  
"I'm a little lost."  
  
A smile that seemed to suit a gentle chuckle.  
I responded with a straight face, approaching without hesitation.  
  
"Can you help me?"  
"Such a kind young lady."  
  
Two of the debt collectors tried to get my attention. As for the other
one, he was putting down his baggage and taking something
out—probably—  
  
"Rope and burlap sack."  
  
Right. They'll lull me into a false sense of security. Two debt
collectors will grab me, and the other one will tie me up with the rope
he's prepared and put me in the burlap sack.  
  
"You won't catch me."  
""Huh?""  
  
The two debt collectors reached for me.  
I ducked to the right, avoiding their grasp, and dashed toward the other
debt collector.  
  
"Cat Punch!"  
  
Tighten your core and pull your right hand firmly. Step confidently with
your left foot, put your weight into it, and punch!  
My punch, delivered simultaneously with my words, landed squarely in the
stomach of the man who had prepared the rope and sack.  
But even so, it was just a punch from a three-year-old.  
Even if it hit his solar plexus, it would only hurt a little, and he'd
recover quickly.  
  
But—  
  
If I unleash a \[Cat Punch\] with the \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\], onto which
I've layered materials and numerous effects, then a three-year-old's
punch will become a shockwave!  
  
"Become a star!"  
  
Simultaneously with my words, the air around the debt collector's
stomach compressed.  
And then, the compressed air was suddenly released towards him—  
  
"—Guwaaaaaah!!!"  
  
—Twinkle!  
  
The man preparing the rope and sack was blown away into the distant
sky.
