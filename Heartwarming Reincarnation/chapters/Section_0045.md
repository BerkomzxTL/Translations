# Chapter 45・Supporting From the Shadows

"Samyu, everyone!"  
  
After confirming the full-body armor descending straight from the sky, I
immediately called out to Samyu.  
The armor will land between the gazebo and the gate. To keep everyone at
a safe distance, I asked Samyu to guide Mayor Thomas, Count Gaillard,
and the three maids away.  
Then, I hoisted up Carrie.  
  
"R-Reni!? Aren't I too heavy?!"  
"It's okay. Reni is strong!"  
  
That's right! Right now, I'm wearing the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and
\[Winged Rabbit Boots\]. Carrie is taller than me, but lifting her is no
problem.  
  
"Hold on tight."  
"Y-yes!"  
  
A princess carry, so to speak. After confirming that Carrie had her arms
around my neck, I leaped from the gazebo towards the mansion.  
It seems the red-haired knight is heading towards the full-body armor,
and we crossed paths.  
The red-haired knight looked surprised to see me carrying Carrie, but
without stopping, she continued towards the armor after I nodded to
her.  
  
"Wait here, okay?"  
"Yes!"  
  
I set Carrie down in front of the mansion.  
The people Samyu had guided had gathered there, along with the guard
soldiers, forming a circle around them. The red-haired knight and
several soldiers seemed to be approaching the full-body armor.  
  
*'Samyu, can you hear me?'*  
*'Yes!'*  
  
I spoke to Samyu using \[Telepathy\] so that the others couldn't hear
us.  
  
*'It's better if Reni's strength isn't revealed, right?'*  
*'Yes...The princess and the soldiers we saved know, but it's probably
best to avoid being seen directly by the mayor and the lord for now.'*  
  
Samyu had told me a lot before we came to this tea party. It's not
always good to have your strength known by those in positions of
authority like the mayor and the lord. I don't need any shackles or
constraints.  
So...  
  
*'Reni will secretly help.'*  
  
Right. As long as it's not obvious, it's fine.  
  
*'Yes! Let's move to the shade of that tree over there. I'll fight from
there with my bow. I'll testify that I was with Lady Reni the whole
time, so Lady Reni's strength won't be revealed to anyone here. After we
get to the shade, Lady Reni, please hide your presence and go over
there!'*  
*‘Mhm. Please.'*  
  
After finishing the \[Telepathy\], Samyu dashed out from between the
soldiers.  
I followed suit, slipping out of the circle.  
Using \[Mana Manipulation\] to enhance her physical abilities and my
\[Winged Rabbit Boots\], Samyu and I were able to reach the shade of the
tree next to the gazebo with a speed impossible for ordinary humans.  
Everyone will be surprised, but since they've already seen or heard
about me defeating a dragon, this shouldn’t be a problem.  
Once we reached the shade, I pulled my hood down low.  
  
"Okay, I'm going."  
"Yes! Be careful!"  
  
After speaking to Samyu, I leaped out from the shade.  
The opponent is in full plate armor!  
Three soldiers were just then bringing their swords down on the armor.
You can't cut through armor with a sword, but the impact should make it
stagger and throw it off balance.  
However—  
  
"Gwaaaah…!!"  
"S-strong…Is this a human…?"  
"What's going on…!?"  
  
The full-body armor didn't flinch at all from the three soldiers'
swords. On the contrary, it even knocked away the soldier whose attack
it received. And it didn't even budge from the blows to its shoulders
and back from the remaining two soldiers.  
  
"Don't be afraid!"  
  
Someone quickly circled around to the front as if to shield the
knocked-away soldier. The movement was light and very graceful.
Beautiful red hair flowed with the motion.  
  
""Lady Pio!””  
  
The two soldiers had hesitated due to the armor's power, but thanks to
the red-haired knight's support, they seemed to regain their fighting
spirit. They parried the blows aimed at their shoulders and backs, and
launched another attack. And then―  
  
"There!"  
  
The red-haired knight said this briefly, then thrust her sword straight
towards the neck of the full-body armor. The rapier precisely hit the
seam between the armor plates.  
This should have been the end. But—  
  
“……Damn it, everyone, keep your distance!!”  
  
The red-haired knight's dignified expression changed drastically as she
pulled back her rapier and leaped backward. The other soldiers quickly
followed suit, pulling back their swords. But the full-body armor moved
even faster. It swung its sword horizontally.  
  
"Guh…!!"  
"Aaah…!"  
  
The red-haired knight, having quickly retreated, wasn’t hit. The two
soldiers managed to block with their swords, but they couldn't cushion
the impact, and they were sent flying.  
  
"Dangerous!"  
  
One of the soldiers was about to hit a nearby tree, so I jumped between
the soldier and the tree. Then, I thrust out both hands, wearing the
\[Cat's Paw Gloves\].  
  
"Cat Cushion!"  
  
As I spoke, the soldier slammed into me. It was incredible speed, but
when he touched my pink paw pads, the soldier floated slightly in place.
Then, he slowly fell to the ground.  
  
"……Eh?"  
  
The soldier, having held his breath and tensed up in anticipation of the
impact, couldn't understand the situation and looked around. Perhaps he
thought someone else was there. Of course, he couldn't see me, so the
mystery wouldn't be solved.  
  
"Are you injured!"  
"……No!"  
  
He seemed bewildered but reacted to the red-haired knight's voice and
quickly stood up.  
It seems he’s alright. The other soldier who had been thrown back
probably has scrapes and bruises, but he was getting up from the
ground.  
Yep! As expected of me! The support from the shadows is perfect!  
Getting between the thrown soldier and the tree would normally be
dangerous. I probably would have been crushed too. But the \[Cat's Paw
Gloves\] have a shock-absorbing effect!  
I watched the backs of the soldiers running back into battle and
chuckled. Then, I stared intently at the full-body armor.  
  
"Monster."  
  
Yes. It's not human.  
The red-haired knight's attack had definitely hit a seam in the armor,
and the depth and speed were enough to reach its neck. Structurally,
there should definitely be a body inside the armor.  
The abnormal strength, unyielding spirit, and—the armor is empty.  
  
"Living Mail."  
  
—A moving armor.  
  
The thing before me was a monster that went by that name.
