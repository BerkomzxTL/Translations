# Chapter 65・The Seal Has Been Broken

As Count Gaillard spoke, light gathered toward me.  
Then, a shock like a lightning bolt ran through me.  
  
"Reni!"  
"Reni…!"  
  
I heard Carrie and Pio's voices in the distance.  
…Why is this?  
Though I know who those voices belong to, my heart isn’t reacting to
them.  
My consciousness faded. And then—  
  
"My body… so hot…"  
  
My whole body feels like it's burning.  
My fingertips and toes. From there, the fire just kept spreading.  
Is this what it feels like to disappear?  
  
"But…"  
  
There's no pain, no suffering.  
I closed my eyes and concentrated my consciousness not on my burning
body, but on the center of my chest.  
Then, I hear something crack deep inside my chest.  
  
"I won't lose."  
  
I'm the strongest four-year-old.  
I came to save Carrie and the children!  
  
"Leave it to Reni!"  
  
I opened my eyes and set free the thing in my chest throughout my whole
body! It feels like I'm overwriting the flames erupting from my body
with this power.  
At that moment, I realized that something… a shell-like thing in my
chest, made a popping noise and disappeared.  
  
"This… why? Why won't it disappear…?"  
  
Count Gaillard, watching me standing in the center of the magic circle,
widened his eyes in astonishment.  
The light from the magic circle had already disappeared.  
I puffed out my chest and answered.  
  
"It's a Jewel."  
  
Before my chest, a shining object floated.  
I covered it with both hands as if supporting the light.  
  
—This is the Jewel.  
  
An item I obtained in the game before my reincarnation.  
On Christmas night, I dug in the hidden room. I used the \[Pickaxe
(Legendary)\] and checked each square one by one.  
It paid off, and I got it… or so I thought. The \[Jewel (Legendary)\]
displayed as "obtained," but I couldn't confirm it anywhere else—in my
status, item list, or encyclopedia.  
Here, I heard that my father and Samyu obtained it from a dragon and
used it to treat my mother's mana rampage. Did I inherit it as her
daughter?  
All I know is that the Jewel is with me now.  
It was probably with me from the moment I was born.  
  
"Reni, your ears…"  
"Reni… were you an elf?"  
  
I tilted my head in confusion at Pio and Carrie's voices.  
Ears… it's probably not about the cat ears.  
I removed my right hand from the Jewel and brought it to the side of my
face.  
And then, gently touching—  
  
"It's true."  
  
My ears are pointy. Probably like Samyu's.  
Pointed ears and power flowing from the center of my chest throughout my
body.  
There's no need to check my status.  
  
"The seal… is broken."  
  
The magic circle tried to erase my body, but I resisted it.  
As a result, the sealed part of my \[Elf (Sealed)\] status has been
removed.  
"I see," I nodded. Then, Count Gaillard trembled.  
  
"Amazing… what an amazing light! Moreover, that appearance… I thought
you were just a beastkin, but that's not the case… I understand! You
yourself are the Jewel!"  
  
Seeing me with the Jewel held to my chest, and the seal broken, Gaillard
cried out.  
  
"If you wish it, everything will be yours! I, too…!! Keep me by your
side. I will surely be of use. Being the ruler of a kingdom was just a
small dream. With you, the world can be yours…!"  
  
He cried out as if overwhelmed with emotion, and Count Gaillard
prostrated himself on the spot.  
Then, an arrow flew straight from the door.  
  
"Who's there?!"  
  
Just before the arrow pierced Count Gaillard, he quickly got up and
moved back, dodging the arrow.  
But with a \*zip\* sound, the red cloth was torn.  
Because he had been prostrating, his reaction was delayed, and the arrow
struck the red cloth Count Gaillard had been wearing.  
The one who fired the arrow was, of course—  
  
"Foolish."  
  
—Samyu.  
She must have come back after rescuing the children.  
  
"Does Lady Reni wish to obtain the world? The Jewel is certainly a
wonderful item. That Jewel is with Lady Reni. But Lady Reni is not here
to fulfill your desires."  
  
Samyu said that, and then nocked another arrow.  
  
"What Lady Reni wishes is important. To want to be with Lady Reni to
fulfill your own desires is unacceptable!!"  
  
The arrow fired again, heading toward Gaillard.  
Gaillard grimaced and quickly waved his hand.  
Then, a Living Mail appeared and deflected the arrow's trajectory.  
  
"Everyone… why don't they understand my words? The Jewel is there.
What's wrong with trying to fulfill one's desires?"  
"I'm not interested in your ambitions. They're not suitable for Lady
Reni. That's all."  
"Unsuitable… yes, there's some truth to that."  
  
Gaillard clapped his hands.  
  
"From the looks of it, the Jewel is still young."  
  
Saying this, he stared intently at me from behind the Living Mail.  
  
"Jewel. You want to help children. Isn't that right?"  
  
Count Gaillard said this and smiled gently at me.  
I thought for a moment… and honestly nodded.  
  
"Return the children to their original places."  
"Yes. I understand. I was searching for a child who possessed the Jewel.
In other words, the children I gathered was to find you. It's no
exaggeration to say that they're victims because of you. It pains my
heart. You are the root of all this."  
"Mhm. Maybe."  
  
My father and mother hid me.  
They didn't register my birth, and even though my father became ill and
we were poor, they protected me. That's why I wasn't taken away.  
Because I was in hiding, the children were brought here.  
  
"Don't you think it's your fault that Her Highness the Princess suffered
from the rumors, was attacked by the dragon, and was ultimately abducted
by me?"  
"I do."  
  
If my possessing the Jewel and being born into this world caused a
prophecy and motivated Count Gaillard, then it could certainly be said
that it’s my fault.  
If my existence is the root cause of everything—  
  
"—Therefore, I’ll save them."  
  
What has happened cannot be undone.  
But I can save the people who are crying now.  
  
"Hahaha! How simple!!"  
  
Count Gaillard laughed loudly upon hearing my answer.  
  
"That's impossible! You think you can save everyone?!"  
  
Then, a resolute voice echoed, drowning out his laughter.  
  
"Be quiet. All the children here have been released. All of them have
been saved. And we've gathered evidence of your wrongdoing. You're
finished here."  
"I don't think it's Reni's fault at all! Reni has power. Gaillard, you
yourself desired that power and committed evil!!"  
"Possessing power isn't evil. It's all about how you use it!!"  
  
Samyu, Carrie, and Pio.  
The three of them stared at Count Gaillard with strong eyes.  
Count Gaillard heard them, but he didn't take his eyes off me.  
  
"In that case!! Jewel, how will you use your power? Do you think you can
defeat all evil with it? …Look at me. I sought your power and became
evil. Does evil disappear if you defeat it? The more you show your
power, won’t evil only increase? The world may look beautiful in your
eyes. But, like my royal capital, Riwander, it’s filthy and corrupt!!"  
  
Muddy gray eyes. I could imagine that his gentle smile was a mask.  
I met his gaze.  
There's no need to look away. Because the answer is already decided.  
  
"Reni wants to travel."  
  
The world of the game I loved so much.  
The world that helped me, a hikikomori who couldn't fit into daily
life.  
  
"The people I love, the people who are important to me. If they cry, I
want to help them."  
  
The number of people I like has increased. The number of people I
consider important has increased.  
…Because I don't want them to cry.  
  
"Whether this world is beautiful or dirty…"  
  
As Count Gaillard said, this world is probably not made up of only
beautiful colors.  
  
"Reni will see, and decide."  
  
Because I still don't know anything. I haven't seen anything.  
I want to travel to the ends of the world and meet all kinds of
people.  
Then, it won't be too late to decide.  
  
"…That's wonderful. Traveling with the Jewel will be enjoyable."  
  
Gaillard murmured this…  
And smiled gently again.  
  
"By the way, the elf girl said, 'I saved everyone.' Is that true? Are
you certain that this underground facility is the only one? Besides the
Living Mail, I can also control Deathbirds and Ghouls. I don't like
controlling such inferior beings, but… they are just right for gathering
children."  
  
And then he continued talking.  
—There are still hostages, he said.  
  
"There are still some. The children are in my hands. Jewel, will you
abandon the children? If you come with me, the children in the capital
will be released. You said you didn't want anyone to cry. But as things
are now, the children will cry."  
"Understood."  
  
I nodded at that.  
To summarize, there are other underground facilities in the capital
city, and the children are there.  
Is that right? Then—  
  
"Jewel."  
  
Until now, I had only gathered the power from the center of my chest to
my right hand.  
But now there's no need to do that.  
I just need to spread the heat overflowing from my body to the ground.  
  
—I just need to purify it all at once!  
  
The range is the entire capital city.  
No matter where Gaillard has the Living Mail on standby, the power will
reach them….  
  
"Return everything to its proper form."  
  
Release!  
  
"Become light!!"  
  
At that moment, my body became intensely hot for an instant.  
And a dazzling light rose from the ground.  
  
"Ugh!!"  
  
Along with Count Gaillard's muffled scream, I heard the sound of many
suits of armor collapsing.  
I don't know the actual range, but not only the basement but the whole
capital city must be shining like this.  
I kicked off the floor with a thud.  
  
"Reni will grant your wish."  
  
I flew towards Count Gaillard's chest.  
If the Living Mail's protection is gone, it's just this one man
standing.  
  
"Purify Riwander."  
  
\[The Wandering Capital, Riwander\]. The knights there, and the people
used as test subjects in the magic circle—their bodies are gone.  
And they continue to be manipulated by Gaillard against their will.  
They're surely crying, 'I want to go home.'  
  
"Cat punch!"  
  
Clench my fist and pull my elbow in firmly.  
Now all I have to do is jump with all my might!!  
  
"Become a star!!"  
  
—Twinkle  
  
A star streamed across the shining Gaillard capital.
