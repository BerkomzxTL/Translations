# Chapter 98・It’s \[The Forest of Reflection\]

Finally, only one of Hamu's treasures remains.  
According to information Hamu left behind, the last one is supposedly in
\[The Forest of Reflection\].  
She didn't tell me what enemy possessed the final treasure, but I had a
hunch…  
  
“Probably a Doppelganger.”  
  
The trees shimmered, bathed in light. But it wasn't a normal green. The
trunks and leaves gleamed like crystals. It’s so beautiful.  
After leaving \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\] and heading west for four
days, we arrived at \[The Forest of Reflection\].  
Karigano is also with us. Her role as desert guide was over, but she
decided to continue traveling with us. …Though Samyu kept trying to shoo
her away.  
Before entering the jewel-like forest, we talked.  
  
“I see. A \[Human Shadow (Doppelganger)\], then. I’ve heard of them.”  
“Karigano knows too! I heard they live in this forest and lead people
astray. The village elder said they don’t attack or become hostile; they
just play pranks!”  
  
I pondered Karigano’s words.  
Unlike the \[Naga\] and the \[Cockatrice\], the \[Human Shadow\] was a
monster that existed in the game.  
Beyond \[The Forest of Reflection\] lies the \[Crystal Castle\], which
is necessary to progress the story. The \[Human Shadow\] was the boss of
\[The Forest of Reflection\].  
The \[Human Shadow\], as an enemy, copies the appearance and abilities
of its opponent. Defeating it isn’t a matter of leveling up; the higher
your level, the stronger the \[Human Shadow\] becomes.  
  
“The Doppelganger will copy us.”  
“Copy? Like an imitation?”  
“Mhm. It’ll look the same as us. Its powers too.”  
“Eeh?! That’s what they mean by pranks? Karigano will become two
Kariganos? If there are two Kariganos, I don’t know which one would
win!”  
  
"This is a problem!" said Karigano, thinking deeply about the matter.  
Right. How do you win against an opponent with the same abilities?
That's the problem.  
  
“If we meet a Doppelganger, let’s talk to it first.”  
“Right. I don't know if it will listen, but it would be best to ask the
monster to hand over the treasure itself."  
“Mhm mhm! \[Human Shadows\] don't immediately become hostile. Talking
might work.”  
“But if that fails… we'll fight.”  
  
With both the \[Water Serpent\] and the \[Poisonous Chicken\], we
obtained their items after winning the fight.  
After all, you need to get the item from the boss by defeating the
boss!  
But how to defeat it?  
What I did in the game was―  
  
“Use a lot of items.”  
  
―a material suppression strategy using a massive number of items!  
  
“Lady Reni’s items…! That certainly can't be copied by the \[Human
Shadow\], and they’re incredibly powerful!”  
“Little Reni’s items! The tent, the pickaxe, and the recovery potions
were all amazing. \[Human Shadows\] can copy appearance and abilities,
but not belongings!”  
  
Samyu and Karigano blushed excitedly at my words. I chuckled.  
…They both believe in me.  
Even if a \[Human Shadow\] appears and copies our appearances and
abilities. Even if talking and asking for the treasure fails.  
―We can definitely win!  
  
“No matter who it copies, it’s okay. Reni will use items.”  
“Yes! In that case, I’m be fine too! Even if it copies Lady Reni’s
appearance, I definitely won’t mistake it.”  
“Karigano has a good nose, I think I can tell by the smell!”  
  
We all looked at each other and nodded, "Okay!"  
However, when Samyu was about to make eye contact with Karigano, she
quickly looked away.  
  
“If there are two rabbit beastkin, there won't be any problem if we just
defeat both of them."  
“Why?! Tell them apart properly!”  
  
Karigano puffed up her cheeks at Samyu’s words.  
And so, the three of us entered \[The Forest of Reflection\]. We
ventured deeper and deeper.  
My heart danced with joy at the sight of the glittering trees, and I
felt a thrill at the thought of encountering the \[Human Shadow\].  
  
“This is fun.”  
  
Following Hamu’s advice, a treasure hunt started in order to suppress my
\[Mana Rampage\].  
It let me experience with my five senses the sights I had only seen in
the game.  
…I feel truly grateful.  
Living with my father and mother. Traveling with Samyu. Meeting Carrie
and Pio. Meeting Queen Hasano in the Elven Forest. Traveling with Hamu
and Karigano.  
A warm feeling bloomed in my chest, and before I knew it, I found myself
smiling.  
That’s why…….  
I guess I was probably a bit careless.  
  
“Little Reni! Wait! Something’s there!”  
“Lady Reni, over here!”  
  
Karigano sniffed, pointing towards the depths of the forest.  
Samyu, on guard, hid me behind her back.  
  
“Hmm? Something’s moving vaguely?”  
“Is that the \[Human Shadow\]?”  
  
I peered into the forest’s depths from behind Samyu.  
There seemed to be something about the size of an adult, distorting the
scenery unnaturally, wavering. It felt like a transparent something was
there.  
Then, the distortion stopped, and the light shone brightly.  
I squinted, blinded by the light, and the distortion began to shake
rapidly. Then, it shrunk.  
The \[Human Shadow\] must have copied one of the three of us. The
transparent distortion popped, and a figure emerged from it.  
The figure was―  
  
“This is…?”  
“Hmm? Who is it?”  
  
Samyu and Karigano stared curiously at the figure.  
But I couldn’t pay attention to them anymore…  
  
“Ah, that’s…”  
  
My voice… trembled. My heart pounded unpleasantly, my pulse quickening.
No, wait... no, but, that's...  
  
“I…”  
  
The moment I understood, my throat constricted as if strangled.  
The figure that had appeared… was me.  
A hikikomori high school girl from Japan. Black hair, black eyes. The
sweatsuit was the same room clothes I always wore.  
She looked anxious, hunched over, and her eyes were wandering timidly.  
Yes. That’s me. Then, who am I, here now? …Who am I?  
  
“Re—!”  
“—ni—”  
  
My ears are ringing.  
My chest hurts.  
What's in front of me is... dark.  
A black vortex spun, swallowing me.  
  
“It’s dark.”  
  
I wondered who had murmured that.  
I must have been holding my breath, because the moment I opened my eyes,
there was a wheezing sound as I took a deep breath.  
My heart pounded, and my palms were drenched in cold sweat.  
And I… I…  
I sat up from where I was lying down and looked around.  
  
“My… room.”  
  
My bed, where I always slept. The comforter was on the floor, probably
kicked off.  
This is… yes. My room. The room where I, the hikikomori high school
girl, lived… The room where I slept on Christmas night, thinking I would
do lots of events tomorrow.  
  
“Oh, I see…”  
  
I clutched at my chest. I realized the possibility immediately.  
  
“I’m back… no, was everything before a dream?”  
  
I don't know. I don't know, but...  
Reni Shurm Guora. Level capped, carrying over items, reincarnated. The
four-year-old who had traveled the world.  
  
―Has become a simple hikikomori high school girl.
