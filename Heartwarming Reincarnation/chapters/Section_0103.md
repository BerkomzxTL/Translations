# Chapter 103・I Got a Jewel

After Samyu regained her senses, I explained to everyone about my past
life and this world.  
Everyone tilted their heads at the "game world" part. According to Hamu,
there might be many worlds connected to each other in this way.  
Samyu, Hamu, and Karigano all listened seriously to my story and said
that if I was born into this world and we're together, then it's fine.  
  
And so, the four of us set off for \[The Wandering Capital,
Riwander\].  
Now that I possess Hamu's three treasures, have acquired the \[Mana
Manipulation\] skill, and overcome my past life, I have no blind
spots!  
Once I finished the purification, all the undead-type monsters
disappeared.  
The creatures that had existed even after losing their physical bodies
due to the power of the jewel returned home.  
  
"Purification, complete."  
  
The buildings were dilapidated because they hadn't been touched for many
years, and it was undoubtedly a ruined capital.  
But the stagnant air was gone, and the beautiful blue traces on the
houses' outer walls and the white castle walls of the royal palace shone
brightly.  
Now that the monsters are gone, with human intervention it should be
possible to revive the area.  
  
"As expected of the young elf... To perform a purification of this scale
without even changing your expression. Your power is overflowing."  
"Lady Reni, how is your body?"  
"Mhm, I'm fine. Same as always."  
  
When I purified the Gaillard capital, I went into a state of \[Mana
Rampage\].  
But I don’t feel any fatigue, drowsiness, or have a fever. Mhm. I'm
definitely getting stronger.  
  
"Little Reni! Look! Something shiny is flying towards us!"  
  
Just as Karigano said, I saw something in the direction she was
pointing.  
Yes. It’s very bright. And this light is—  
  
"It's a jewel!!"  
  
Hamu exclaimed.  
Come to think of it, Riwander had become an undead-type monster dungeon
because the king who sought immortality had wished upon a jewel.  
Perhaps that was that jewel. Maybe it had finished its role in Riwander
and become free after I purified it.  
The jewel floated gently and came towards us…or rather, towards me.  
  
"No way! Is this young elf planning to get her hands on a second jewel?!
Isn't that a bit too much power?!"  
  
Hamu said that and tried to grab the jewel that flew towards me. But the
jewel swayed left and right, avoiding her.  
Hamu repeated this several times... then gave up.  
  
"Alright, I get it... do as you please."  
  
The jewel, addressed by Hamu, floated gently in front of me.  
Its shape is different from the jewel I possessed. It looks like
something you’d find on top of a Christmas tree.  
The jewel shone brightly for a moment. I closed my eyes because it was
dazzling.  
After the light disappeared, I opened my eyes, and the jewel was gone—  
  
"It went into your body. …To obtain two jewels is quite
unprecedented."  
"As expected of Lady Reni…!"  
"Little Reni, amazing!"  
  
There were no particular changes to my body. But the second jewel, like
the first, will probably stay with me. We'll travel together. That's
what it must mean.  
  
"Riwander… is it okay to leave it like this?"  
  
Although I purified it, is it okay to leave this place like this?  
Until now, it had been a dungeon, so no kingdom claimed it as territory,
but now that there are no more monsters, it feels like it would be best
for someone to manage it.  
So when I said that, Samyu nodded.  
  
"After the purification here is complete, we are supposed to report to
the Langirosa Kingdom."  
"Langirosa. That's Carrie's kingdom."  
"Yes. So, I think it would be best to go meet the King of Langirosa."  
"Mhm. I want to see Carrie and Pio."  
  
I nodded at Samyu's words.  
I’d be very happy to see Carrie and Pio while reporting on the
purification of Riwander.  
I hope we can talk about a lot of things.  
  
"I want to talk to Papa and Mama, too."  
  
Even knowing that I was different, they always loved me just the way I
was.  
Since leaving on my journey, I've been reporting through Samyu, but I
really want to meet them and talk in person.  
About meeting Hasano in the Elven Forest, that everyone in the Elven
Forest is doing well. About my past life and this world.  
I don't know how the average father and mother would react to their
child having a past life, but I feel like those two will laugh and
accept it.  
  
"That’s right. After reporting on the purification in the Langirosa
Kingdom, it would be nice to visit Lady Reni's mother."  
"Mhm."  
  
And—  
  
"Let's go on another adventure!"  
"Yes!"  
  
I will enjoy this world to the fullest.  
There are still many sights I haven't seen. I'll experience them with
all my senses.  
  
"The world is still full of wonders."  
  
Hamu chuckled.  
Nodding "Mhm," my heart fluttered with excitement.  
  
"There are also strong enemies as well. …You're bound to encounter
unpleasant people and troublesome things."  
"Mhm."  
"It's okay! Karigano is coming too!"  
"But even with a rabbit beast person, I don't feel reassured at all."  
"That's mean!"  
  
Yes. I’m sure it won't be all fun and games.  
There will be difficult and painful things. But…  
  
"Don't worry."  
  
—Because I'm the strongest four-year-old!  
  
"Leave it to Reni!"

This concludes the story.  
Thank you very much for reading.  
The third volume of the novel is now available. I would be happy if you
could pick it up. Wishing that your every day will be filled with
sparkles.

TN: Thanks for reading :)  
  
Some rough edges that get smoothed out in the manga (and probably the
LN), and to be honest I found the MC's tendency to treat everything like
a video game to be somewhat detached and messed up, but still mostly
fun.  
  
My next (current) project is [Liberation of the Demon Kingdom \~The Tale
of Two Girls\~ ※The Adventure of Two Girls Who Are Unrivaled With Swords
and
Magic](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/liberation-of-the-demon-kingdom-the-tale-of-two-girls-%E2%80%BBthe-adventure-of-two-girls-who-are-unrivaled-with-swords-and-magic/).
It's a little shallow, but it's a chill yuri adventure so that makes it
okay. Check it out if it seems interesting.
