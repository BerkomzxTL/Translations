# Chapter 97・I Got the \[Poisonous Chicken\] Treasure

Twinkle, twinkle. The world began to shine.  
The miasma was transforming into particles of light.  
And the \[Cockatrice\] itself started to shine. Its purple feathers
changed—  
  
“A-Amazing! The miasma’s gone…! And the chicken is sparkling so
much…!”  
“As expected of Lady Reni. I knew you possessed a recovery potion with
strong effects, but to think you could use it in this way… Not only is
your ingenuity amazing, but the execution that made it possible is
impressive."  
“Such a recovery potion exists! And there’s enough to sprinkle on a
chicken! Little Reni is amazing…!”  
  
—Pure white feathers. A healthy-red comb. Cute, round eyes.  
The Poisonous Chicken, whose status effect \[Miasma\] had been removed
by the \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\], tilted its head and let out a,
‘Bwuk?’ while still buried in the sand.  
Yep. Now it’s just a big chicken.  
Samyu and Karigano, who arrived immediately after the miasma
disappeared, widened their eyes in surprise at its appearance.  
I let out a fufu.  
  
“Next is the treasure.”  
  
I’ve caught it and removed the miasma.  
I don’t know how effective the \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\] is, and
the \[Poisonous Chicken\] might release miasma again at some point, but
for now, I should be able to get the treasure.  
  
“In the case of the \[Naga\], it was inside its body. If we assume it’s
the same, the \[Poisonous Chicken\] should also have the treasure inside
its body.”  
“Will it give it to us if we ask?”  
  
The \[Naga\] gave it to us when Hamu instructed it to.  
So, expecting the same, I tried talking to it.  
  
“Cockatrice, treasure, give?”  
*‘…Bwuk!’*  
  
Upon hearing my request, the \[Poisonous Chicken\] turned its face away
with a ‘Hmph!’ It’s defiant even though it's buried up to its neck in
sand.  
Instantly, a murderous aura crackled from beside me.  
  
“Let’s shoot it.”  
  
Samyu said simply, nocked an arrow, and drew her bow.  
Of course, her blue eyes glittered. It’s a mana-infused arrow.  
  
“To refuse Lady Reni’s request is worthy of a thousand deaths. Let’s
fire the world’s most powerful arrow into its soul.”  
“Samyu, wait!”  
  
No good. The \[Poisonous Chicken\] will turn into a porcupine.  
In a panic, I hurriedly hugged her knees, and Samyu’s rolled back and
she lost all her strength. Good.  
  
“Little Reni, do you want something from the chicken?”  
“Reni wants an item. I think it’s inside the Cockatrice.”  
“There’s an item hidden in the chicken’s body, and we just need to take
it out? Little Reni, you want to get it without killing the chicken?”  
“Mhm.”  
“Then leave it to Karigano! Karigano often butchers chickens in the
village! Even though its body is big, I think the structure is probably
the same. Chickens have a place in their stomach where they swallow and
store rocks to help with digestion. I think it's there!"  
  
I nodded in agreement at Karigano’s words.  
It’s probably what’s called the gizzard. It certainly looks like it's
there.  
  
“Little Reni, could you… remove some of the sand?”  
“Can.”  
  
I nodded confidently at Karigano’s words. Then Karigano let out an
“Eeeh” sound.  
  
“Amazing… I was just talking, but it's amazing that you can actually do
it! Then, please remove the sand just below the neck, around the
chest!”  
“Understood.”  
  
Following Karigano’s instructions, I dug there with the \[Pickaxe
(Exceptional)\]. I was careful not to dig too deep, since the
\[Poisonous Chicken\] would be able to escape.  
And when I successfully created a space, Karigano descended into it.
And—  
  
“The gizzard is here!”  
  
—Rolling Kick…!  
She spun sideways and kicked the area between the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]’s neck and chest with the sole of her foot with all her
might.  
There was a loud bang. The impact was strong, and the place where it had
been kicked was left with a large dent.  
…Amazing. Strong. High physical ability…  
Such an amazing technique came from Karigano with her pink hair, round
pink eyes, and long fluffy ears…  
The kicked \[Poisonous Chicken\] tried to hold its breath. But it
couldn’t hold it in…  
  
*‘Oeeeee!’*  
  
It vomited violently towards the sky.  
…Mhm. I think this needs some mosaic processing.  
  
“Lady Reni!”  
  
As if sensing something, Samyu, having recovered from her rolled eyes
state, lifted me up and flew away from the spot.  
Just then, the \[Poisonous Chicken\]’s vomit began falling down, plop
plop plop.  
  
“Rabbit beast person! What are you doing!? Lady Reni was in great danger
just now!?”  
“S-sorry! I didn’t think it would vomit in that direction! Little Reni,
are you alright!?”  
"Don't worry."  
  
I nodded in response to Karigano’s worried face as she hopped out of the
hole.  
Samyu set me down on the ground and approached the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]’s vomit. Then, skillfully using two arrows, she grabbed
something and lifted it up.  
  
“Lady Reni, I found it! This appears to be the treasure! Due to the
effect of Lady Reni’s recovery potion, there’s no miasma, but…”  
Samyu trailed off. Then, Karigano raised her hand, “Yes sir!”  
  
“Then Karigano can be of use! I smell water over there. There’s probably
an oasis!”  
“Then let’s wash it there.”  
“Mhm. Cockatrice, here you go.”  
  
I stared at the \[Poisonous Chicken\] still buried in the sand.  
Its eyes have lost their light, appearing vacant. Since it’s lost its
fighting spirit, it should be fine to remove the sand.  
I used the \[Pickaxe (Exceptional)\] to chip away at the sand. Once I’ve
done it to a certain extent, the \[Poisonous Chicken\] flapped its wings
and jumped to the surface. Then, with a dododo sound, it kicked up a
cloud of sand and ran away.  
  
“Bye bye.”  
  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\] seemed to want to leave as quickly as
possible, and left without looking back even once.  
After seeing it off, we headed to the oasis with Karigano’s guidance.
Samyu washed the item in the gushing spring water.  
And…  
  
“Lady Reni, this is it.”  
“Beautiful…”  
  
What Samyu handed me was a rainbow-colored magatama. (TN: a curved,
comma-shaped bead)  
It’s about the size of a mandarin orange. Made of a mysterious material,
it changed color depending on the angle of the light.  
When I checked my item box, this is what was displayed:  
  
\* \[Cockatrice’s Magatama\]  
\* One of the treasures of \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]. It was created
to save the world from peril when \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] fell into
slumber.  
\* Always: All attribute attacks +200%, environmental change resistance
+200%  
\* When used: A spell will grant an elemental weakness to any target of
the user’s choice.  
  
“Waoow…!”  
  
T-this is a cheat attribute accessory…! Since it makes elemental attacks
incredibly powerful, it’s a very useful item in boss battles.  
Typically, the stronger the boss, the less effective elemental attacks
become. They often have no elemental weaknesses. In the end,
non-attribute attacks are stronger, and weapons that are not affected by
elements become easier to use.  
But this accessory seems to be able to inflict an attribute weakness on
the opponent… Inflict a weakness on the opponent and attack them with
attribute attacks +200%. It's literally cheating!  
  
“Lady Reni, how are you feeling? How’s your body…?”  
  
As I was rejoicing over the item’s effects, Samyu looked at me
worriedly.  
That’s right. I was looking for this treasure to prevent myself from
suffering a \[Mana Rampage\].  
If what Hamu says is true, equipping this should help me until I grow
up…  
  
“Ah, my body feels light!”  
  
Just like when I equipped the \[Naga\]’s dagger, I felt my body become
lighter than before.  
I took off the \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\] and the \[Winged Rabbit Boots\] and
tried hopping around on the spot.  
Mhm! My body feels so light!  
The increase in ‘environmental change resistance’ is probably a good
thing.  
  
“Samyu, look! Reni can jump higher than before!”  
“Yes! You’re practically flying through the air!”  
“Karigano will jump too!”  
  
As I hopped around, Karigano hopped around next to me.  
Although Karigano could jump much higher, Samyu was very happy to see
me.  
  
“Then, next is the last one!”  
  
—Let’s get the third treasure!
