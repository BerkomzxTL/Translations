# Chapter 55・I Understand the Purpose of the Church

The church floor between the children and me closed completely.  
A moment ago, there was light in the hallway, but now it's pitch
black.  
This darkness is where a cat's eyes come in handy!  
Looking around, I could see the walls collapsing towards me with a
rumbling sound.  
Mhm. At this rate, I'll become a fossil.  
  
"Lady Reni!!"  
  
At that moment, a ray of light flew straight ahead, piercing the
ceiling. The sound of Samyu's voice came from the direction the arrow
came from.  
It seems Samyu broke down the door to the priest's room with an arrow.  
The collapsing passage made it hard to tell front, back, left, and
right, so the destination was unclear, but thanks to Samyu, I'm able to
see clearly where to go.  
  
"This way!!"  
  
About 20 meters ahead? Samyu called out to me.  
But as she spoke, the corridor wall completely collapsed.  
This is a life-threatening fossil crisis!  
But it's okay. Because I'm the strongest four-year-old.  
  
"I'll blow away the obstacles!"  
  
I extend my claws and swiped them from bottom to top.  
  
"Cat's claws!"  
  
The resulting slash blew away the collapsed corridor wall.  
  
"When you see the path, follow it."  
  
The path was about to close again.  
I put force into my legs and leaped through the gap.  
  
"Jump!"  
  
Straight toward Samyu.  
The passage forcibly opened by me completely closed with a \*Bang!\*
sound the moment I went through.  
  
"Safe."  
  
This time, I didn't overshoot and successfully reached my destination.  
I laughed softly.  
Then, Samyu immediately came beside me and knelt on one knee.  
  
"Lady Reni, I must apologize. This has become…"  
"No, it's okay. The children went home."  
  
…I think. I didn't see it through to the very end, but they made it to
the surface, and all the thugs are down.  
  
"More importantly, Samyu, are you alright?"  
"Yes. Upon arriving in this room, I immediately captured the priest.
However, when he saw me and laughed in a sickening way, that monster
appeared."  
"Monster?"  
  
I raise my face at Samyu's words.  
In front of me was the priest and—  
  
"…Living Mail."  
  
The empty full-body armor that came to the tea party with Carrie.
\[Living Mail\]. It stood there as if protecting the priest.  
  
"After the Living Mail slashed at me, it immediately untied the priest's
ropes. I distanced myself and attacked it, but my arrows alone were not
enough to stop its movements… Then the priest suddenly set a red crystal
into a device, moving to destroy and seal the basement."  
  
While listening to Samyu’s story, I observed the priest and the Living
Mail.  
The Living Mail has places where arrows have been lodged and other
places where holes have been drilled into it.  
She probably shot the Living Mail with mana-imbued arrows, just like at
the tea party with Carrie. Unlike then, the knight Pio isn't here, so
she couldn’t physically stop it, and the priest used the device.  
  
"That monster seems to be controlled by the priest…"  
"Monsters, friends with humans?"  
"Normally impossible. Monsters aren't capable of intellectual activity.
Each has its own territory, and they usually attack when they see living
beings. It's unthinkable for one to act like it's protecting a human."  
  
I nodded in understanding to what Samyu said. Normally, it seems like
it’d be impossible to control monsters.  
But the priest before me actually has the Living Mail under his
command—  
  
"This is the power of God."  
  
In the face of our confusion, the priest spoke with an ecstatic
expression.  
  
"We have obtained the power of God. This armor is borrowed from the
Bishop. It's a power entrusted to me because of the Bishop's deep
trust."  
"Bishop?"  
"Those who preach to believers in the church, like us, are priests. And
the one who leads them is the Bishop. The Bishop has obtained the power
of God and bestowed it upon us."  
  
After hearing the priest's explanation, Samyu and I exchanged glances.  
This is a branch church of a new religious group. The priest in front of
us is the head. Above him is the Bishop who leads the priests. And, if
the priest's words are true, it’s the Bishop who can use the power of
monsters.  
  
"You seem to respect the Bishop, so why did you go to such lengths as to
destroy the basement?"  
  
At Samyu's words, the priest, who had been entranced until now, suddenly
lost his expression.  
Then, he muttered softly.  
  
"Because it's no longer needed."  
"Not needed?"  
"Yes. The Bishop has obtained what he aimed for. This church was built
for the Bishop to obtain his objective. A church above ground. A
facility underground. And the underground facilities are no longer
needed."  
"What was the objective?"  
  
The priest raised the corners of his mouth with a smirk.  
  
"–A child."  
  
His dim eyes twisted into a crescent shape.  
  
"A child who possesses the power of God. That was our goal."  
"…But hasn't the sect already obtained the power of God?"  
"No. Our power is not yet perfect. However, if we obtain the prophesied
child, we will obtain the complete power of God. That's why we have been
moving for so long."  
"The children being sold and going missing all over the place was the
sect's doing, wasn't it?"  
"That's right. And this place functioned as a central hub for gathering
children. It's a rural village, but we let the children gathered here
stay for a while. Then, we carefully transported them to headquarters so
that they wouldn't be traced. This is the base for communication with
headquarters. Being entrusted with this was a great honor, and my
achievements here were supposed to allow me to move to headquarters.
There, I was supposed to become a chosen priest who would assist the
Bishop."  
  
The priest's dim eyes became darker.  
  
"But, it seems the objective was obtained through a different route. And
now, there is no longer a need to gather children."  
"You mean the child with the power of God has been obtained?"  
"Yes, that's right. And so, I'll continue as a priest in this rural
village…Unbelievable. It's wrong…After working so hard for the Bishop,
I'll end up in this rural village…it's wrong!"  
  
The priest said this while scratching his head.  
  
"See how much scheming I did to gather these children…! I even locked up
the children of this village so it wouldn’t be made public. Everything
was for the Bishop's sake…!!"  
  
The excited priest's breathing grew heavy.  
  
"But, the Goddess didn't abandon me after all!!"  
  
With ragged breathing, he stared dreamily at Samyu.  
  
"It's you. The elf, you came to this village…! I'm about to rot here, so
I want to spend my last moments with you, who is closest to the
Goddess."  
  
Flushed cheeks, but dim eyes.  
Ah, I see. I understand.  
  
"Selfish."  
  
He sacrificed many children for his own advancement, and when he
realized that he couldn't advance, he destroyed everything and tried to
take Samyu, who appeared before him. He's talking so freely because he
thinks both he and Samyu are going to die. There's no need to hide
anything.  
  
"Shut up! You beast-person! I'll start with you!!"  
  
The priest pointed at me.  
Then, with a creaking sound, the Living Mail began to move.  
But—  
  
"The Living Mail doesn’t want to."  
  
—I can hear a voice.  
I hear it saying, 'I want to go home.'  
  
"…Gather the heat in my chest."  
  
The churning feeling in my chest.  
I kneaded the overflowing heat into one.  
And—  
  
"Become light!"  
  
—I released the heat in my chest toward the Living Mail!  
The light emitted from me hit the Living Mail and enveloped it.  
Then, it fell to the ground with a crash.  
  
"Wh…What is this…? What's happening…? Why…? How can a beast-person child
do such a thing?! Beast-people are the furthest from the Goddess! In the
first place, it's unforgivable that you're even with this elf! You
should be ashamed of yourself!"  
  
The priest, driven by panic, flew into a rage.  
Samyu, watching, coldly retorted.  
  
"The one who should know their place is you."  
  
Then, she drew her bow.  
  
"Don't you understand Lady Reni's brilliance?"  
  
The arrow shot at him hit near his right shoulder, tearing his white
robes.  
Samyu could have hit him, but she probably missed on purpose.  
  
"It's foolish to say things like, 'because you're a beast-person,'
'because you're an elf.' The idea that elves are closest to the Goddess
and beast-people are the furthest is nothing more than an illusion
humans made up. And what is this Goddess, who may not even exist?"  
  
Samyu stared coldly at the priest.  
  
"–Even when Lady Reni is right here in front of you."  
  
The priest, as if he had just noticed my presence, widened his eyes.  
  
"…That's right…No, but…Still…Yes, certainly…"  
  
He mumbled.  
Then he shuddered and cried out.  
  
"I see, it's you…!! Your age, your power…!! That power is
undoubtedly…God's…!!"  
  
There’s no longer any mockery in the way he looks at me.  
Well, it doesn't matter. I only have one thing to do!  
  
"Cat punch!"  
  
I rushed towards the priest's chest.  
Clenched fist, strike his lower abdomen! Shoot at a 45 degree angle!  
  
"Become a star!!"  
"Uwaaaaaaaa!!"  
  
—Twinkle  
  
"Okay."  
  
A hole in the basement ceiling for the priest's body.  
Mhm. I just saw a beautiful shooting star.  
  
"Samyu, let's get out of here."  
"Yes!"  
  
We jumped out of the hole to the surface.  
The shooting angle was perfect, the hole was in a position where there
were no buildings, so it wasn't causing any trouble to anyone.  
And, it seems the children safely returned home, and the adults of the
village were gathered around the church.  
They noticed me and Samyu emerging from the hole, and cheers erupted.  
They seemed to have been worried about me.  
I can see the children running towards us. I waved to them, saying "It's
okay"—  
  
"Samyu, I want to go to the headquarters."  
"Yes, that's right. It seems they’ve stopped collecting children, but
they haven't been returned yet. I'm also curious about the child they
were after."  
"Right."  
"I'll investigate the room a bit."  
"Mhm. Please."  
  
Samyu returned to the basement through the hole.  
I’m sure she’ll probably find something that leads to the sect's
headquarters.  
As I was thinking this, the villagers surrounded me, and one after
another, they thanked me.  
There were many people crying, and everyone's been reunited with their
families, so it's all good. As I was thinking that, I heard
\[Telepathy\]—  
  
*'Lady Reni! I need to tell you something urgently!'*  
*'What?'*  
  
A more anxious voice than the usual Samyu.  
What is it? I concentrated on the telepathy, and what I heard was—  
  
*'The Bishop's name is Galim Gaillard. —He is the lord of this
domain.'*  
  
—Bad news.  
  
Count Gaillard is the person who took Carrie from the royal capital and
welcomed her to his domain.  
He had gray hair slicked back, a gentle demeanor, and a soft smile.  
That's the…Bishop?  
If so, the person in the most danger right now is—  
  
"Carrie."
