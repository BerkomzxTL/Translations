# Chapter 94・Please Guide Me

According to Hamu, there's a risk not only of me disappearing along with
the \[Jewel (Legendary)\] due to a \[Mana Rampage\], but also some
unforeseen event occurring.  
My first priority was to learn \[Mana Manipulation\] and prevent a
\[Mana Rampage\]. Furthermore, while I wait for my body to grow, I’ll
rely on Hamu's three sacred treasures.  
Hamu is planning to go into a slumber to gather strength in case an
unforeseen situation comes up.  
If nothing happens, I may have to say goodbye to Hamu.  
Hamu is \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]. It’s a miracle that we even met,
talked, and traveled together.  
It was Karigano who volunteered to be my guide in place of Hamu.  
  
"\[The Ever-Shifting Desert\] is right next to the village where
Karigano lived! I know all about the chicken!"  
"Chicken?"  
"I’m talking about the \[Poisonous Chicken (Cockatrice)\]! It's huge,
poisonous, and surrounded by miasma, but it's still basically a
chicken!"  
"To call my familiar a chicken... It might be stronger than a
\[Naga\]!"  
"Fwaaa!"  
  
Listening to Karigano and Hamu's conversation got me excited.  
A Cockatrice is a creature that looks like a mix between a chicken and a
lizard. Most of them are poisonous.  
The game's \[Ever-Shifting Desert\] had lizard monsters, but no
\[Cockatrice\]. \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\] changes its terrain each
time you enter, and rather than being a dungeon with a boss, it was more
of a transit point between villages.  
Once I could teleport between cities, it was a map I only went through
if I needed monster materials from the desert area.  
To think there would be a boss-level monster there…!  
  
"Karigano can be of use! Karigano has amazing hearing and a great nose!
Little Reni is a member of the Beast-People Image-Up Club! That's why
Karigano will help!"  
  
Saying that, Karigano quickly got up from her kneeling position and
hugged me tightly.  
It looked like Samyu was about to reach out, but Karigano was faster.  
Karigano rubbed her fluffy cheeks against my cheek. It tickled, and I
couldn't help but laugh.  
  
"Kuh, let go… let go… you're too strong…!"  
"There’s no way an elf can match the strength of a beast person~♪"  
"Ugh, kuu!!"  
"Little Reni, you should touch Karigano's ears. They're fluffy!"  
  
Samyu seemed to be trying hard, but Karigano didn’t budge at all.
Amazing. This is the power of a beast person!  
My head tilted as her charming fluffy ears swayed.  
  
"Reni can touch them?"  
"Of course!"  
"Samyu, it's okay."  
"Kuh… yes, I understand."  
  
Samyu let go of Karigano after hearing my words.  
Then I gently reached out to Karigano's ears. The soft, dense fur felt
fluffy against my palm. When I moved my fingertips around, the tips of
the fur brushed smoothly against the pads of my fingers. Amazing. It
feels so good!  
  
"Fwaaa…"  
  
Karigano's ears have a very nice texture. I carefully touched them so as
not to hurt Karigano, but it was a great experience.  
When I took my hand away, satisfied, Karigano's cheeks were red, but she
was smiling happily.  
  
"Karigano still doesn't know Little Reni's circumstances, so just
explain what you can tell Karigano. Karigano will be useful! Chicken is
incredibly smelly, so I can find them anywhere. I'll guide Little Reni
properly, so leave it to me!"  
"I don't trust you at all."  
  
As Samyu said this, she rubbed the wrinkles between her eyebrows with
her fingers. There were deep, deep wrinkles etched there.  
However, the fact that we just had this conversation in Karigano's
presence suggests that both Samyu and Hamu trust Karigano to some
degree.  
…Perhaps they thought she wouldn't understand anything from just
listening to the conversation.  
I stared at Karigano in front of me.  
Pink hair and matching eyes. Right now, her cheeks are pink as well. …I
don't think she has any ill intentions. But…  
  
"Karigano, is it okay to be with Reni?"  
  
That's the problem.  
Until now, I've traveled with Samyu, Carrie, Pio, and Hamu. Samyu is my
guardian, and also a protector entrusted with my care by my father and
mother.  
And with Carrie, it all started with saving her from a dragon attack,
and there was a necessity to travel together to solve the incident.  
Hamu, as \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\], was watching over me, guiding me,
and making sure the world didn't end.  
But Karigano has no reason to be with me.  
  
"It's okay if you go somewhere else, you know?"  
"Won't Karigano be useless?"  
"It's not that…"  
  
Karigano's pink eyes shimmered with tears.  
I let my eyes wander.  
  
"It won’t be good for Karigano."  
"Feh?"  
"Because… Reni makes mistakes."  
  
No one wants to make mistakes, but we do. And I'm someone who makes a
lot of mistakes.  
Samyu always smiles at me, even knowing that I’m like that. That's why I
feel safe being with her  
But I don't have that same sense of security with Karigano yet.  
  
*'Don't cause trouble.'*  
  
Those are the words my mother said to me many times before my
reincarnation.  
My classmates in the same group also looked annoyed when they saw me
flustered.  
I'm scared that those cute, round pink eyes will look at me the same
way. Because Karigano has no benefit in being with me. So…  
  
"Then there's no problem at all!"  
  
Karigano spoke in a bright voice, as if to catch my attention.  
  
"Karigano said she wants to be useful to Little Reni. That's Karigano's
own will! Being together is a good thing!"  
"...It is?"  
"It is! Besides, what Karigano just said was Little Reni's words."  
"Mine?"  
  
I blinked rapidly.  
My words…?  
  
"Little Reni said that Karigano making a big mistake isn't a problem at
all! Karigano found that incredibly reassuring."  
  
Karigano smiled brightly after saying that.  
  
"Karigano is okay with Little Reni making mistakes. Because Karigano
makes mistakes too!"  
"...You are?"  
"That’s right!"  
  
When Karigano says it so enthusiastically, it really does start to feel
that way.  
I couldn't help but laugh, and Karigano hugged me tightly and leaned her
cheek against mine.  
  
"Karigano will be useful to Little Reni! Leave it to me!"  
"Mhm."  
  
Fluffy ears wiggling. I nodded involuntarily at the warmth and softness,
and heard a groaning sound coming from behind.  
  
"Kuh… how cunning… to soothe Lady Reni's anxieties with fur… Looking at
it now, even the fur color is cunning…. Get away… get away from her!"  
  
Samyu started trying to pull her away. This time, Karigano easily
separated from me and smiled happily.  
  
"Little Reni entrusted Karigano with the task of guiding her! Karigano
will do her best!"  
"Guh… Lady Reni, are you alright? You seemed anxious a moment ago…"  
  
Samyu took my hand and softened her gaze.  
  
"Lady Reni doesn't need to worry about anything. In the first place,
this rabbit beast person attacked Lady Reni and apologized, saying it
was a misunderstanding. Then, the village was taken advantage of by
greedy people and was in a difficult situation, but Lady Reni saved it.
Whether this rabbit beast person will be useful is unknown, but Lady
Reni just has to use her chin to boss her around."  
  
After sniffing, she continued.  
  
"I believe even just the two of us, myself and Lady Reni, can reach
\[The Ever-Shifting Desert\] without issue. However, it’s true that
finding the \[Cockatrice\] in the vast desert with its changing terrain
may take considerable time… In that case, it might be better than
nothing."  
"Mhm."  
"As Lady Reni wishes."  
"Reni… Mmn …I'll ask Karigano."  
  
When I looked up at Karigano, her face lit up.  
  
"Leave it to me! I'll show you how useful Karigano is!"  
  
Samyu made a very displeased face at that smile and pointed sharply.  
  
"Keep physical contact with Lady Reni to a minimum. Don't get close,
don't touch, don't seduce with fur. Just do your best to work hard for
Lady Reni."  
"Little Reni, Karigano will do her best!"  
  
Karigano said that and, slipping past Samyu, hugged me tightly.  
Samyu is desperately trying to stop it.  
  
"You're not listening at all! I was just warning you about that right
now!?"  
"Little Reni~♪"  
"Ah, again, this… kuh…"  
  
Samyu was trying hard to pull Karigano away.  
Hamu nodded, watching them.  
  
"Beast people have high abilities. I'm relieved."  
"Hamu, thank you."  
"Hmm? It's too early for thanks! I'll come see you again when nothing
happens and the young elf's body has stabilized. Then…"  
"Mhm."  
  
And so, I parted ways with Hamu and set off on a new journey with
Karigano.  
So.  
  
"Let's go!"  
  
Let’s go to \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\]!
