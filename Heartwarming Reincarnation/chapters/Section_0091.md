# Chapter 91・A Rabbit Beastkin

"Bwuh, killing intent! Lady Reni!"  
  
Samyu, who had been submerged in water until just now, abruptly raised
her upper body to a right angle.  
It seems she's trying to protect me from the girl with a knife.  
  
"Who are you?!"  
  
Samyu hugged me and leaped high.  
After putting distance between herself and the girl with the knife,
Samyu looked at the source of the killing intent with a sharp
expression.  
  
"...Are you okay?"  
  
Cool. Samyu is really cool.  
But, her face is soaking wet, and water is dripping from her mouth and
nose... clearly the look of someone who had just been drowning... While
looking up at Samyu, I asked, and Samyu nodded, saying, "Yes."  
  
"It's no problem. I overreacted. I apologize for making Lady Reni feel
threatened."  
"Mhm, that's good."  
"Lady Reni, please wait here. I'll subdue her."  
  
With that said, Samyu put me down on the ground and closed the distance
with the girl.  
The girl was captured in an instant, and Samyu bound her with rope.  
The knife was taken away, and the girl was thrown to the ground. She
seemed to be straining with all her might, but the rope didn't budge.  
  
"T-this is impossible! As a beast person, a rope like this should break
easily!"  
"Impossible. No matter how strong a beast person you are, it's
impossible for you to break through a rope made of magic silk thread
strengthened by the mana of an elf."  
"Mmghhhh!"  
  
The girl was wriggling, but the rope was firmly secured. It seems the
danger is over.  
Confirming this, I walked towards them slowly.  
  
"Approaching."  
"Yes, Lady Reni. It should be safe now."  
  
I stood beside Samyu and looked at the girl right next to me.  
As the girl had called herself a "beast person," it seems she wasn't
human. She had fluffy, long pink ears on her head. She had a pink, round
tail on her rear. In other words, this was—  
  
"It's a rabbit."  
  
A gasp escaped my lips.  
Because I know Hamu, I've seen species with horns, wings, and tails in
human form. However, this is the first time I've seen a fluffy beastkin
like this in real life.  
I have the \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\], which make me look like a beast person,
but seeing a real beast person like this made me involuntarily let out a
cry of admiration. So fluffy...!  
Her pink hair was tied in braids on both sides, and her eyes of the same
color were round and very cute.  
  
"Why did you target Lady Reni?"  
  
Samyu looked down at the cute rabbit beast girl with cold eyes.  
The rabbit beast girl seems to have given up on escaping the ropes for
the time being; she relaxed her strength and glared at me sharply.  
  
"I don't know who Reni is! That child was pretending to be a beast
person! It's terrible to pretend to be a beast person when you're human!
She must have been trying to damage the image of beast people!"  
"Beast person?"  
"Image damage?"  
  
I tilted my head, questioning the rabbit beast girl's words and
exchanging glances with Samyu.  
Earlier, I had removed my \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\] equipment, so my cat ears
and tail were gone. She probably saw that and thought I was "pretending
to be a beast person."  
However, I don't understand the meaning of "damaging the image of beast
people."  
Samyu seems to have come to a similar conclusion and looked down at the
rabbit beast girl with cold eyes again.  
  
"What do you mean by image damage?"  
"Exactly what it means! ...Beast people are said to do bad things.
Because beast people have high physical abilities, they can do whatever
they want in the human world. That child was probably pretending to be a
beast person to exploit that and bully the village!!"  
  
The beast girl said, "Unforgivable!" and started straining her body
again with a "Mmghhhh" sound.  
Seeing that, I pondered, "hmm”.  
It’s been four years since I was reincarnated in this world. It hasn't
been long since I started traveling, but as the rabbit beast girl says,
I feel there's prejudice against beast people in the human world.  
I felt it especially strongly during the Gaillard incident.  
I thought it was due to the newly established religious sect's belief in
the creation myth that "elves are closest to the goddess, and beast
people are the furthest."  
However, according to the beast girl, beast people, due to their high
physical abilities, are more likely to attack humans or steal from them.
This may further strengthen the prejudice against them.  
And, it seems the beast girl jumped to the conclusion that I was using
this to harm the village at the foot of the mountain.  
  
"Reni wouldn't do such a thing."  
  
I shook my head firmly from side to side.  
As Samyu listened, she seemed to realize that it was just the beast
girl's misunderstanding that had caused her to attack me, and her eyes
were fixed on her.  
  
"The problems in the village at the foot of the mountain were caused by
pointless and petty greed among humans. Lady Reni saved the village with
her generous heart, even though it could have been left alone. ...For
someone to attack Lady Reni out of a misunderstanding after only
witnessing this from the sidelines..."  
  
Samyu grabbed the rabbit beast girl's rope tightly.  
Then she started walking towards the lake.  
  
"Let's sink her in the lake."  
"W-wait! Even a beast person would die if they were thrown into a lake
while tied up with an unbreakable rope!"  
"Repent for your foolishness."  
"Hyaaaaa!!"  
  
Samyu stood by the edge of the lake with the screaming beast girl.  
Up in the sky, Hamu was looking down with her arms crossed, and in the
lake, the \[Water Serpent\] was looking at me worriedly.  
It seems no one was planning on stopping her.  
I quickly called out to Samyu.  
  
"The lake is beautiful, I like it."  
  
That's right. I've loved the CG-rendered lake surface since before my
reincarnation. After destroying the reservoir and restoring the water, I
finally got to see it with my own eyes.  
But it would be a shame for it to become a cursed lake... \[The Lake of
Refreshing Rain\] becoming \[The Lake of Tragedy\]...  
  
"It's better to keep it clean."  
  
The water quality... the legend...  
So when I said that, Samyu, who was about to throw the girl into the
lake, stopped abruptly.  
Then she smiled at me.  
  
"That’s right! It would be unthinkable to pollute the lake with the
corpse of a rabbit! Let's bury her!"  
  
Burying her is also... a little...  
I somehow managed to stop the hasty Samyu.  
And, we decided to move first.  
Our destination was the village inn.  
After saying goodbye to the \[Water Serpent\], it rubbed its head
against me as if to say thank you, then dove back into the lake.  
And, when we arrived at the inn...  
  
"I'm really, really sorry! It was a misunderstanding...!!"  
  
Seeing me being called "Lady Cat," "Lady Cat" by the villagers along the
way, she seemed to have realized her terrible misunderstanding.  
The rabbit beast girl performed a very beautiful dogeza on the floor of
the inn.
