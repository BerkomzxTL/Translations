# Chapter 20・The Safe Is Here

Now that the leader has become a star, I can't ask him about the
location of the safe.  
But continuing the conversation would have been pointless, and I
actually figured something out from my interaction with him earlier.  
It was―  
  
"He kept looking here."  
  
―Right around the center of the pile of rubble.  
  
Every time the word "safe" came up, his gaze always went there.  
Whenever that topic came up, he'd speak over me, his voice getting
louder.  
I think he was trying to distract me, pretending to be malicious or
mocking, because he didn't want me to know about the safe.  
  
"Obvious."  
  
The eyes speak volumes.  
While words are important for gathering information, nonverbal cues like
facial expressions, eye movements, and trembling hands are also crucial.
The leader was incredibly easy to read.  
So then.  
  
"Is it here?"  
  
I used my \[Cat's Claws\] to carefully move aside the rubble.  
A wooden floor quickly appeared. At first glance, it looked no different
from the surrounding floor, but...  
  
\*Knock knock\*  
  
When I tapped it lightly, it sounded hollow, unlike the other parts.  
There's a space here. No doubt about it.  
On closer inspection, it looks like a storage compartment in a kitchen,
with a square section of floorboard that looks like it could be
lifted.  
I inserted my claw into the gap, and with a heave, the floorboard easily
came loose.  
  
What appeared was a gaping darkness.  
That's right. If this were a game, it would be the type where you
investigate each square one by one, and when you reach a certain point,
the status would say something like, "There seems to be something
here."  
In a game, you'd have to do it painstakingly, but in reality,
observation is key.  
I nodded knowingly and used the ladder to descend.  
I could have jumped down thanks to my \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], but I
wasn't sure what the ground was like, so I played it safe.  
The ladder was a little over one meter, and I quickly reached the
bottom.  
  
"So dark."  
  
I landed on both feet and looked around, but there was no light, only
darkness.  
A normal person probably wouldn't be able to see anything, but...  
  
"Lots of food."  
  
I could see shelves with food lined up in the dark room.  
The room is about six tatami mats in size. Surprisingly spacious.  
  
"...Cat eyes are handy."  
  
The reason I can see in the dark is because I'm using the \[Cat's Paw
Gloves\], which give me \[Cat's Eyes\].  
I wonder if real cats see like this? I looked around curiously.  
But I never thought \[Cat's Eyes\] would be this useful.  
In the game, there was an item called \[Fairy's Lantern\] that
illuminated the darkness, and it was much easier to use. If you leveled
it up, using it before entering a dungeon kept you bright until the
end.  
Of course, I could use it now, but I can see perfectly well, and using a
\[Fairy's Lantern\] in reality would benefit everyone, not just me.  
That would make it easier to be detected.  
I'm currently operating in secrecy.  
  
"Suspicious... something suspicious..."  
  
The shelves were lined with canned goods and dried foods, the kind you'd
stock up on for long-term storage.  
But that's exactly what's suspicious.  
If it was truly a food storage room, they could have made the entrance
easily accessible, but the entrance here was cleverly hidden behind a
normal-looking floorboard.  
There's definitely something here.  
Certain of this, I went to the back of the basement. And then―  
  
"Here it is."  
  
Underneath a simple wooden shelf, on the bottom level.  
There were paper bags of flour lined up.  
It looked normal at first glance. But something black and silver was
glinting at the back.  
I went closer and moved the bags aside.  
The flour bags were probably about 30 kg each, big bags. If I didn't
have the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\], they would have been too heavy to move.  
With the \[Recovery Potion\] and \[Fertilizer\] too, if I had worn the
\[Cat's Paw Gloves\], I wouldn't have failed because of the weight.  
...But I can't wear the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] in front of my mom and dad.
I'd turn into a cat.  
It's perfect for disguise, but not for everyday use.  
While thinking that, I moved all the large bags of flour to the side.  
After moving the bags, I could see that the wall behind was recessed,
and a black square object fit snugly into it.  
It was...  
  
"Safe, found."  
  
The safe had a silver handle, and it seemed to have a dial lock. The
type where you turn it to the right 5, left 20, click click click.  
You need a passcode to open it.  
Of course, I don't know it. The leader is also a star.  
But don't worry! I have the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\]!  
  
"Unlock!"  
  
I brought my right-hand claw close to the silver handle.  
This effect, \[Unlock\], is something that gets added when repeating the
synthesis process.  
  
\*Click\*  
  
A dry sound, and the lock opened.  
When I opened the safe, I found a huge amount of documents inside.  
  
"Loan documents, loan documents...more loan documents."  
  
I'll take them out and check them one by one, starting with the most
noticeable ones.  
Most of them seem to be IOUs, but that's not what I’m looking for.  
There must be something more important.  
So I didn't give up, and as I checked each document I took out of the
safe...  
  
"...Found it."  
  
I couldn't help but chuckle.  
It was there. It really was there.  
In my hands was a document proving the misdeeds of the mayor, Shultem.  
  
...A hidden ledger.  
  
I don't know the details, but it's probably about embezzlement, fraud,
and things like that.  
There was also something that looked like human trafficking.  
If my mother had been caught by the debt collectors, her name would have
been in the copy of this human trafficking contract.  
For the time being, I’ll hold on to all the shady documents.  
Then I went back to the basement entrance.  
Unlike when I came in, my hands were full, so I couldn't use the
ladder.  
So, I decided to use the power of my \[Winged Rabbit Boots\].  
  
"Jump!"  
  
I carefully eyed the entrance in the basement ceiling and kicked off the
floor.  
The entrance isn't very big, and I didn't want to misjudge and hit my
head, but as expected of me, I managed to escape through the entrance.  
  
"―Whoa!"  
  
Oops…! I may have gotten a little too carried away!  
I jumped higher than I thought I would.  
I only needed to land on the first floor, but before I knew it, I found
myself on what was originally the second floor.  
Because of the momentum, the wind pressure increased, and some of the
documents I was holding flew out of my hands.  
Distracted by the fluttering papers, I reached out for them.  
My posture became unsteady...  
  
"That’s dangerous–!"  
  
I heard a bell-like, beautiful voice.  
Someone's here?! I looked down in surprise, and there was a girl with
shiny golden hair and bright blue eyes...  
  
"Over here!"  
  
I lost my balance and floated down softly.  
The girl caught me securely.
