# Chapter 46・I Can Hear a Voice

Once upon a time, there was a powerful kingdom. This kingdom was
renowned for its magical research, said to have enabled even humans to
wield powerful magic.  
The king, who had conquered the world with his magical power, harbored a
single ambition.  
  
―Immortality  
  
He desired this to preserve his hard-earned honor and wealth.  
The research, undertaken as a national project, was finally completed
just before the king's death.  
It involved a magic circle encompassing the entire capital city,
funneling all its power into the royal castle at its center.  
The king, on the verge of death, rejoiced at the magic circle's
completion and immediately activated it.  
The result—  
  
"He just turned into a monster."  
  
What a mess.  
It became a dungeon called the \[The Wandering Capital, Riwander\] in
the game, teeming with undead-type monsters.  
As you progress through the game's scenario, it’s revealed that the
magic circle was beyond human control. The mages' plan was to separate
body and soul, then affix the soul to an object. This would achieve
immortality. However, the human soul can’t withstand the power and will
shatter.  
The city-wide magic circle was incredibly powerful, engulfing the
capital's citizens and royal castle staff. Everyone lost their physical
bodies; their broken souls attaching to other things.  
\[Living Mail\], for example, is a monster formed from a knight's soul
inhabiting armor.  
In the game, they never leave the capital… but.  
  
"I'll shoot!"  
  
While I was pondering, Samyu's resolute voice rang out.  
Samyu, drawing her bow, loosed an arrow at the Living Mail.  
Her blue eyes gleamed, so they must be infused with mana.  
The arrow, glowing with light, pierced the armor's torso.  
  
"Giiigiig…"  
  
The Living Mail emitted a strange sound like scraping metal and took a
step back.  
It was strong against physical attacks, but magic seems to work.  
The Living Mail pulled out the embedded arrow, crushed it, and the
broken pieces scattered on the ground.  
  
"No way…"  
"It's… empty…!"  
"A monster…"  
  
The soldiers' faces fell as they noticed the large hole and empty space
inside—no one was inside the full-body armor. Then Samyu's firm voice
echoed again.  
  
"If you're afraid, back off. You're in the way."  
  
She loosed another arrow.  
However, the Living Mail seemed to notice and deflected it with its
sword.  
The mana-imbued arrow fell to the ground.  
The Living Mail, realizing its strong opponent possessed mana, groaned
metallically and advanced towards Samyu.  
  
"I won't back down! Sword!"  
  
With a shout, the red-haired knight lunged at the Living Mail.  
Instead of her initial \[rapier\], she wielded one of the soldier's
one-handed swords.  
  
"Hah!"  
  
The red-haired knight quickly moved to the Living Mail's flank,
thrusting the tip of her blade towards its right shoulder. This is the
same attack she'd made earlier, aimed at the Living Mail's throat. This
time, she was slicing the blade into the seam of the armor.  
But unlike before—  
  
"Hah!"  
  
The red-haired knight body-slammed and pinned the Living Mail.  
Normally, Living Mail wouldn't lose its balance from something like
that, but Samyu's arrow had left it weakened.  
  
"I'll shoot!"  
  
The arrow struck the Living Mail's left knee, creating a large hole  
Becoming unstable, the Living Mail collapsed backward.  
The red-haired knight, still holding her sword in the right shoulder,
plunged it into the ground—  
  
"I see."  
  
Apparently, the red-haired knight planned to take advantage of the fact
that Living Mail is full body armor to anchor it to the ground.  
…It's amazing how hard the ground is.  
I got exhausted after digging about 10 centimeters with a small ladle,
yet the red-haired knight casually plunged her sword in.  
Even considering the force of the fall, it shows how strong the
red-haired knight is.  
She must have switched from the \[rapier\] to the one-handed sword for
this very purpose.  
  
"Sword!"  
"Y-yes!"  
  
At the red-haired knight's shout, a soldier hurriedly tossed her his
sword.  
The red-haired knight took it and plunged it into the hole in the
torso.  
In the end, the Living Mail was pinned to the ground with swords in the
right shoulder seam, the torso hole, and the left knee hole.  
  
"Giiiigiii"  
  
The Living Mail groaned, its metal parts grinding together, struggling
to rise.  
However, the red-haired knight's swords were firmly planted, making
movement difficult. Though the Living Mail has no concept of stamina or
day/night cycles, it might eventually break free if it keeps
struggling…  
  
"Movement restricted. Now all we need to do is destroy the core—"  
"That monster doesn't have a core or anything like that."  
  
The red-haired knight distanced herself from the Living Mail and gave
instructions to the soldiers. However, Samyu interrupted her midway.  
  
"You can only erase something with an embedded soul using mana. In this
case, you need enough power to instantly destroy this armor."  
"I see…"  
"And while I can imbue arrows with mana, I don't have the power to
completely erase it."  
  
The red-haired knight frowned at Samyu's words.  
There are probably no mages present. The only one who could use mana
here is Samyu, but even she can't completely erase it.  
So, the Living Mail will remain as it is… or maybe Samyu could shoot
more arrows to make it smaller…  
The red-haired knight is likely thinking the same thing I am.  
After a moment of hesitation… she approached Samyu. Then—  
  
"Pio! Behind you!!"  
  
A loud voice suddenly erupted from the mansion—Carrie.  
Carrie was looking at the Living Mail, which was supposed to be
immobile, behind the red-haired knight.  
  
"Gii…"  
*'Re…t…'*  
  
Its right arm, where the sword was planted, came loose.  
  
"I…gii…"  
*'Re…tur…'*  
  
Its left knee also came out of place, and the Living Mail, using the
sword in its torso as support, stood on one leg.  
It clumsily approached the red-haired knight.  
  
"Gii, i"  
*'Return.’*  
  
Seeing this, the red-haired knight spun around, drawing her sword. Samyu
also nocked an arrow.  
And I—  
  
"…I hear it."  
  
...I don't know why.  
But I understand the meaning of the scraping sound of metal.  
It's different from \[Telepathy\]… or maybe it's similar. It's probably
only audible to me.  
  
"Gii, i…gii…"  
'I…want…to…return……'  
  
Go home, return, revert.  
What does the Living Mail…a being with an affixed soul…mean by that? I
don't know their true feelings.  
But I have to free it from this full-body armor…  
  
"Go home."  
  
My chest burns.  
I gathered that heat into my right hand…and thrust it towards the Living
Mail.  
  
"Become light!"  
  
Light from my right hand shot straight towards the Living Mail.  
The white light, upon impact, spread around the armor.  
And then, shining brightly—  
  
*'Tha…nk…'*  
  
—ascending light.  
  
When the brilliance faded, the full-body armor clattered and collapsed
on the spot.
