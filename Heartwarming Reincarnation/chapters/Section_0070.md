# Chapter 70・I’ll Receive a \[Mana Appraisal\]

My shoulders jumped at the loud voice.  
Then, Samyu patted my back soothingly.  
  
"Queen Hasano, I understand your joy, but Lady Reni is startled."  
"Haa… Right. I'm sorry."  
  
Upon hearing Samyu's dignified voice, the bespectacled intellectual
beauty who had been clenching her fists and roaring returned to a calm
expression as if snapping back to reality.  
Then, she slowly met my eyes.  
  
"Thank you for that very cute greeting. My name is Hasano. I'm Reni's
mother's older sister. I'm the current Queen of the Elves."  
  
She introduced herself with a small smile.  
At first glance, you wouldn't know she and my mother were sisters. But
seeing her smile, her eyes were exactly like my mother's. Although her
hair color, eye color, and overall atmosphere were different, I can
definitely feel the blood connection between them.  
Seeing my mother's features, the tension left my body.  
That’s good. My greeting hadn't been taken badly. This means my parents
won't be spoken ill of because of me.  
Then there's something I need to tell her.  
  
"Um, Mama is okay."  
  
—I'm sure she's worried.  
  
"Papa and Mama seem happy together."  
  
From my perspective, anyway.  
My mother went through a lot of hardships after leaving the Elven
Forest, but she never once said she regretted it.  
It's possible she couldn't say it in front of me, her child, but no
matter how difficult things were, she remained positive and always
worked towards living with my father.  
I think that's amazing about her.  
My father also supported my mother, and because of the two of them, they
were able to overcome so much.  
  
"Mama's okay."  
  
The matching headbands the elves were wearing and the branches from the
rare \[Shining Tree\] that only grows in the Elven Forest. The fact that
they prepared those means they truly welcome me.  
Samyu told me that elves cherish children and that the entire elven
community is like a family. But, to prepare so much for a child they’ve
never even met must have been difficult.  
They prepared all of this because… they care about my mother.  
My mother, who lived in the Elven Forest until she met my father. My
mother, who existed as the Queen. I feel that she's cherished and loved
by everyone.  
So, when I told her what she was probably most worried about, the
current Queen looked like she was about to cry—  
  
"We elves… we have always regretted what happened to Sonya and our
actions."  
  
It was only for a moment. She quickly closed her eyes as if hiding that
expression.  
  
"But… well… if she's happy, that's good."  
  
A voice as if she was savoring the words.  
And when she opened her eyes again, she smiled with the same gentle eyes
as my mother.  
  
"Reni seems young, but you're a very intelligent child."  
"Yes! Lady Reni is special!"  
  
Samyu exclaimed happily at those words.  
The current Queen chuckled in response, then gently stroked my head.  
  
"Reni. I want to hold you too, is that alright?"  
"Mhm."  
  
A gentle hand stroking my head. I'm sure it's safe to leave myself in
her care.  
  
"Samyu, is it okay?"  
"Yes."  
  
After confirming with Samyu, the current Queen reached for me.  
I reached out too, moving from Samyu's arms.  
When she hugged me tightly, I felt her warm body temperature.  
  
"Reni. Call me by that cute voice of yours?"  
"Call you?"  
"Yes. I'm your aunt, so 'Auntie' is fine."  
  
At those words, I furrowed my brow in thought.  
It's not that I dislike the idea of calling her "Auntie," but I feel
uncomfortable calling a beautiful, intelligent woman with glasses
that.  
So, after thinking for a moment, I quietly opened my mouth.  
  
“...Hasano~”  
  
Is it rude to call an older woman by just her first name?  
When I peered at her inquiringly, the current Queen—Hasano—turned away,
letting out a gasp.  
  
"Fuh…"  
  
And then, again—  
  
"Adorable!! I love you!!"  
  
—A roar.  
Her voice echoed in the night sky that was shifting from purple to
black.  
  
"Please refrain from shouting. Lady Reni will be startled."  
  
And then, Samyu's calm voice stopped her.  
Hasano seemed to regain her composure at those words and she took
several shallow breaths.  
  
"Fuh… kuh… uh. Right… fuh… Reni, I'm sorry. I haven't lived 300 years as
an elf for nothing. If I can’t withstand this much, then what kind of
Elf Queen would I be…"  
  
Hasano said that and wiped the sweat from her forehead.  
  
"…Mhm."  
  
I don't quite understand.  
Upon closer inspection, it seems like some of the elves are having
trouble breathing as well.  
For now, is this way of calling her okay?  
  
"Hasano, don’t like it?"  
"Of course not. You're so, so adorable, I'm really happy."  
  
Hasano laughed softly.  
  
"Anyway."  
  
Then, she cleared her throat.  
  
"Reni, thank you for coming all the way to the Elven Forest. I've heard
about your body's condition through Sonya's \[Telepathy\]."  
  
She gently stroked me.  
  
"Thank you for reconnecting us with her."  
  
Her green eyes were kind—  
  
"Thank you for being born."  
  
The words spoken directly to me tickled my heart—  
  
"I won't just stand by and watch you suffer like we did before. Never
again. We elves have worked hard so that we won’t have days of lamenting
our immaturity. Reni, your body is still hurting, isn't it? I can feel
the heat from your body. First, we'll perform a \[Mana Appraisal\], is
that alright?"  
"Mana Appraisal?"  
  
I tilted my head at the strange phrase, and Samyu explained it.  
  
"\[Mana Appraisal\] is, as its name suggests, a technique to appraise
the mana in one's body. Elves each possess mana, and its quantity, type,
and strength can be determined."  
"Samyu can do that too?"  
"Yes. However, I'm just a novice, and I can only tell if there's mana
and roughly how much."  
"I see."  
  
I nodded at Samyu's words.  
When I defeated the dragon, I did a double jump. At that time, Samyu
said she sensed mana. She also told me about mana when I purified the
Gaillard Capital and during the subsequent \[Mana Rampage\].  
It seems that the elves have a technique to sense mana, and she used
that. But it was just a rough estimate, and Hasano can sense mana in
much more detail. She seems to call that technique \[Mana Appraisal\].  
  
"Queen Hasano is an expert in \[Mana Manipulation\] and \[Mana
Appraisal\]. She is one of the most knowledgeable and skilled elves not
only among the currently living, but of all the elves of all time."  
"Amazing."  
  
At Samyu's words, I involuntarily looked up at Hasano. She laughed
softly.  
  
"Then, I'll let my mana flow now. It might feel strange, but please bear
with it."  
"Mhm."  
  
\[Mana Appraisal\] didn't exist in the game world. The fact that I can
receive it now made me excited.  
As I remained still while being held by Hasano, I suddenly felt a
strange sensation around my forehead…  
  
"The magic circle is slowly descending. Does it feel unpleasant?"  
"I'm okay."  
"I'll use this to see the mana paths and mana sources flowing within
Reni."  
"Mhm."  
  
I nodded at Hasano's words.  
Apparently, Hasano is creating a magic circle and passing it through my
body.  
First, the head. It feels like a round circle slowly descending.  
A medical checkup at the hospital. It's like a magical version of the
large machine that can see your body from top to bottom. Hasano must be
looking at the mana flowing inside me.  
The strange sensation that descended from my head passed through my
chest.  
For a moment, I felt that sensation intensify.  
  
"Hasano…?"  
"…Sorry, I put in a little too much force. …I'll keep going like this
until I reach your feet."  
"Mhm."  
  
Once the intense sensation returned to normal, it continued towards my
abdomen.  
Finally, it reached my feet, and the sensation slowly disappeared.  
The \[Mana Appraisal\] probably went well.  
It was a new sensation, but I'm glad I experienced it.  
I looked at Hasano, excited to hear the results.  
But unlike my eyes, Hasano looked extremely distressed—  
  
"Reni, could it be—"  
  
Hasano squeezed out a pained voice.  
  
"Were you born with not only your own mana, but inherited all of Sonya's
mana…?"
