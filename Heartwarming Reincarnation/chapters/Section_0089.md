# Chapter 89・Versus \[Water Serpent\]!

A week has passed since then.  
The lake safely returned to its normal water level, and the village's
water channels are now flowing smoothly.  
When the large water wheel started turning, the villagers and I were
incredibly excited; it was like a festival.  
The villagers now call me "Lady Cat," and they avert their gaze whenever
they pass me. It seems that Samyu told them "it's disrespectful to look
directly at my form."  
While walking through the village, I used \[Telepathy\] with Samyu.  
  
*'Samyu, isn't this a bit weird?'*  
*'It would be troublesome if Lady Reni's face were to be remembered and
depicted in pictures, etc. Since we've successfully instilled faith, we
shouldn't miss this opportunity to utilize it.'*  
*'Reni's image... depicted...? '*  
*'That is correct. In fact, it's being done over there right now.'*  
*'Mmn?'*  
  
I looked in the direction Samyu indicated.  
There, a villager was working on something with stones they've dug up.  
  
"...Statue?"  
"Yes. That's a statue of Lady Reni."  
"Reni's... statue...?"  
  
I was surprised by the unexpected words. My statue? Really?  
I approached and watched the work intently.  
A stone about my size. It's being carved. It's not finished yet, but the
shape is almost complete.  
The triangles on top are... my cat ears. And the cloth draped over the
shoulders is the hood of my \[Hermit's Robe\]. Yes, and the hands are my
\[Cat’s Paw Gloves\].  
The face is blurry, but that's probably intentional.  
Samyu had told the villagers not to look at my face, so that part was
left uncarved.  
The stonemason was very skilled, and the details are very intricate.  
  
"It's me..."  
  
It’s definitely me. Every part except the face is me…  
I muttered in a daze, and Samyu nodded in satisfaction.  
  
"This statue only manages to express a tiny fraction of Lady Reni's
magnificence, holiness, and charm, but the spirit is admirable."  
  
Her gaze was from above, as usual.  
I was worried that the stonemason might be upset, but he didn’t seem to
mind, and he must be able to hear our conversation.  
  
"—That being, clad in white, descended upon this land. She shaded her
hands and created earth, clasped her hands and created water. Truly a
miraculous descent. Thanks to her divine work, we villagers escaped our
dire situation. We shall tell this tale to our descendants for
generations to come."  
  
The stonemason said this fervently and went back to being absorbed in
his work.  
It seems those are the words being carved onto the statue's base.  
  
"This is a big deal..."  
  
Indeed, a big deal. It's turning out to be quite big…  
As I trembled in fear, Samyu made various suggestions to the stonemason
from the side, such as "the hands should be fluffier" and "the ears are
more intellectual." And the stonemason was complying.  
And then—  
  
"Naga, let's battle!"  
  
Forget about statues!  
It's time for a battle against the \[Naga\]!  
  
"Fuhahahaha! The \[Naga\], who can manipulate water, is strong!"  
"Mhm!"  
  
We moved to the lake and confronted the \[Naga\].  
It's different from the \[Naga\] I saw before, which lacked vitality.
This \[Naga\] is staring straight at me, its eyes shining. Vitality!
Power!  
Hamu was floating in the air, watching us and the \[Naga\] with
amusement; she's in spectator mode.  
Samyu stood beside me, drawing her bow.  
  
"Samyu!"  
"Yes!"  
  
The moment I called out, Samyu released an arrow.  
A mana-imbued arrow flew towards the \[Naga\], but—  
  
"No way! The \[Naga\]’s water barrier will stop it from reaching!"  
  
The arrow was stopped by a wall of water before it reached the
\[Naga\]'s body. The mana-imbued arrow pierced the first water wall, but
it couldn't break through all the successive walls that continued to
appear, and was completely surrounded by the third wall before losing
its power.  
The arrow ended up being absorbed by the water and tossed back to the
shore.  
  
"Cool...!"  
  
This is the \[Naga\]. It can manipulate water and nullify attacks!  
I couldn’t help but look at the \[Naga\] with sparkling eyes, and it
raised the corners of its mouth in a proud smile.  
Yes! This is it! This is the \[Naga\] I wanted to fight!  
  
"Lady Reni! Next time we'll go together!"  
"Mhm! Reni’s coming!"  
  
With a feeling of excitement, I kicked off the shore, following Samyu's
arrow.  
  
"Jump!"  
  
First, head-on!  
  
"Cat Punch!"  
  
Put the momentum of \[Flight\] directly into your punch!  
The \[Naga\] let out a 'Shaa!' cry before my ultimate attack.  
In that instant, water rushed forward, engulfing me.  
  
"I won't lose!"  
  
But it's okay!  
It's not the kind of momentum that can be stopped just because I was
covered in water.  
Even while enveloped, I advanced towards the \[Naga\]. However, the
power of the water was strong and slowed me down, and then—  
  
*'Shashasha!'*  
  
—The \[Naga\] suddenly flipped its body.  
Its tail slams into me.  
  
"Lady Reni!?"  
  
I was sent flying by the force of the tail.  
Samyu hurriedly ran to where I was about to land, and thanks to the
effect of my \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], she caught me as I was falling
softly.  
  
"How are you? Are you okay?"  
"Mhm. The attack was ineffective because I used my paw pads."  
  
That’s right. The moment the \[Naga\]'s tail hit me, I stopped my Cat
Punch and used my paw pads to block the tail. However, while I managed
to defend against the attack, the momentum sent me flying backward.  
  
"It's strong...!"  
"Yes. All my arrows were neutralized."  
  
Samyu muttered in frustration.  
It seems that Samyu's successive attacks were all blocked by water
walls, just like before.  
  
"A \[Naga\] with water is almost invincible. Come on, an attack's
coming!"  
  
Following Hamu's voice, I looked at the \[Naga\], and several clumps of
water were floating in the air.  
And they're flying towards us.  
  
"Water bullets!?"  
"Samyu!"  
"Leave it to me!!"  
  
Samyu kicked the ground while still holding me in her arms.  
The water bullets hit the ground where we were just standing and burst.
The gouged ground was a testament to their power.  
If it hits, both Samyu and I will be finished.  
  
*'Shaaa!!'*  
  
The \[Naga\] let out a cry, and more clumps of water floated in the
air.  
It can use water as a defense and also as an attack with bullets.  
When the \[Naga\] saw that we weren't attacking, it again launched
clumps of water at us as bullets.  
  
"There's no way an attack like that could hit me when I'm with Lady
Reni!"  
  
Samyu said that and kicked off the ground again.  
There were more bullets than before. They're chasing us not only on the
ground but also in the air. It must have matched the timing of her jumps
and distance. The bullets were closing in on our landing spot. At this
rate, they'll hit us...! But—  
  
"Hah!"  
  
As Samyu shouted, her blue eyes shone.  
In that instant, Samyu kicked the air, changing her landing spot and
direction.  
The water bullets exploded in the spot where we were going to land. The
bullets in the air are still chasing us, but Samyu kicked off the air
again and leaped up high.  
The bullets, which were flying low, couldn’t keep up with the sudden
change in trajectory and landed on the ground.  
After confirming that all the bullets had disappeared, Samyu landed on a
large tree branch.  
  
"No matter how many you shoot, it'll be the same!"  
  
Samyu proudly declared this from the top of the tree. So cool...!  
  
"Samyu, you're amazing!"  
"Yes! This is my new technique, \[Lady Reni's Precious Form\]!"  
"...Eh?"  
  
Suddenly, I heard a strange term. I don't quite understand.  
When I asked in surprise, Samyu nodded with a smile.  
  
"It's the name of the technique!"  
"...Technique?"  
"Yes! I demonstrated this technique once, but I didn't tell you the
name. I got the inspiration from Lady Reni's double jump, so I named it
that."  
"Mmn..."  
  
A very cool technique of kicking the air and twisting the body. I think
it’s strange that the name of the technique is \[Lady Reni's Precious
Form\], but since it's Samyu's technique, and she decided on the name,
then that's what it is...  
  
*'Shaa!'*  
  
The \[Naga\] fired water bullets again.  
And again, Samyu twisted her body, kicked in midair, and dodged all of
them. Amazing. Now that Samyu is handling the evasion, I can focus on
the attack.  
  
"Cat’s Claws!"  
  
While being held by Samyu, I extended my claws and unleashed a whirlwind
towards the \[Naga\]. Usually, they're caught in this and sent flying,
and I win, but...  
  
*'Shashasha!'*  
  
As the \[Naga\] roared, a huge whirlpool formed in the lake.  
The whirlwind I created got sucked into the whirlpool. Then it pulled up
the lake water and...  
  
"It’s gone..."  
  
My whirlwind…  
What was that? Was it swallowed by the water? The whirlpool prevented
the whirlwind's advance, and it lost its power while drawing up water.
It seems that being unable to escape the whirlpool was a bad thing.  
  
"Samyu, Reni's going!"  
"Yes!"  
  
Because of the whirlpool, the \[Naga\] isn't able to release water
bullets right now.  
I didn’t miss that opening and asked Samyu to put me down on the
ground.  
Then, I kicked the ground and leaped toward the \[Naga\] again.  
  
"Jump!"  
  
However, the \[Naga\] seemed to have noticed me and immediately created
clumps of water in the air.  
  
"I won't let you shoot Lady Reni!"  
  
Samyu said that and fired off several arrows.  
The clumps of water turned into a water wall to block the arrows rather
than bullets to target me.  
The water rising from the lake is about to envelop me, so...  
  
"Cat Punch!"  
  
Punch the water to avoid being enveloped!  
The water was about to envelop me, but then it burst and fell. But soon
the water gathered again.  
  
"Cat Punch! Cat Punch! Cat Punch!!"  
  
But it's okay! I can punch as many times as needed! And when I
approached the \[Naga\]...  
  
"Microwave!"  
  
\[Microwave\] magic!  
I winked towards the lake, and for a moment, the lake began to bubble.  
  
"What? So in the end you’re going to dry up the lake? Then there was no
point in restoring the lake's water to fight."  
*'Sha?'*  
  
A disappointed-sounding voice came from the sky.  
She probably thought I was going to boil the water and deprive the
\[Naga\] of its power, like when I dried up the reservoir.  
The \[Naga\] also seemed to have noticed the change in the water. But—  
  
"Will use the water."  
  
That's right! I'm not going to fight a powerless \[Naga\] after removing
or neutralizing the water. I’ll use the water myself!  
  
"Samyu! Under the \[Naga\]'s body, shoot!"  
"Understood!!"  
  
While calling out to Samyu, I continued moving.  
  
"Hah!!"  
  
Along with Samyu's determined shout, several arrows were fired.  
Of course, the \[Naga\] tried to block them with a water wall.  
Most of the arrows were absorbed by the water wall, but one arrow
pierced the surface of the water near the \[Naga\]'s massive body.  
  
"Lady Reni, I apologize! Only one..."  
"One arrow can't do anything!"  
*'Shasha!'*  
  
A flustered voice, a disappointed voice, a relieved voice.  
Nobody thinks anything will happen because of this arrow. But—  
  
"It's enough."  
  
—All I needed was a tiny bit of shock!  
  
"Bubble!"  
  
At the sound of my voice, the lake suddenly bubbled up furiously.  
Then the bubbles got bigger and gathered together around the \[Naga\].
Then—  
  
"Blow it away!"  
  
—Bang!  
A giant bubble burst under the \[Naga\]'s body.  
  
*'Shaa...!!'*  
"Whaa!?"  
  
The surprised voices of the \[Naga\] and Hamu.  
The \[Naga\]'s huge body couldn’t withstand the force of the bursting
bubble and was sent flying into the air.  
  
"Double Jump!"  
  
I kicked off the air, chasing after it.  
Jump into the air, catch up to the \[Naga\]. Then, do a full rotation—  
  
"Cat’s Tail!"  
  
My spinning tail hit the \[Naga\]'s underbelly.  
The force was immense, and the \[Naga\] vanished into the sky—  
  
"Become a star!"  
  
—Twinkle  
  
"Okay."  
  
The \[Naga\] became a contrail!
