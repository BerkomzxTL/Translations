# Chapter 16・Let’s Do Some Remodeling

I followed the suspicious people leaving my house.  
We arrived at the town closest to the village, the one where my mother
worked when my father was too ill to move.  
The town is surrounded by a wall to protect against monsters, and
soldiers stand guard at the gate.  
My mother told me that the town basically doesn't allow entry or exit at
night.  
She said that while security is strict, exceptions are made for
emergencies or night jobs…  
  
So how will these suspicious people get into the town?  
  
Feeling puzzled, I continued to watch them.  
To my surprise, they attempted to enter the town through the main gate
without any precautions, even with the guards present.  
  
Surely they'll be caught.  
Or maybe they'll be taken to a separate room for questioning. But—  
  
“We’re coming in.”  
“Understood.”  
  
—They were completely ignored.  
The guards let this suspicious group pass without a second thought.  
  
The suspicious individuals confidently entered the town through the main
gate.  
Of course, since the guards didn't notice me, I easily followed them
in.  
They removed the cloth covering their mouths, but otherwise showed no
caution as they walked down the main street. They passed several people,
but they didn’t seem to care.  
Eventually, they came to a halt on a side street, one block from the
main street.  
While many buildings were tightly packed on the main street, those on
the side street are even closer together.  
It’s night, so I can’t really tell, but I can’t imagine there’d be much
light reaching here.  
The suspicious people entered one of these buildings.  
A three-story wooden structure. What made it stand out among the many
similar buildings was the sign above the door:  
  
*'Slanita Finance'*  
That's what it said on the sign.  
  
“Debt collectors, I guess.”  
  
Seeing this, I connected the suspicious individuals to debt
collection.  
'Slanita' is the name of this town. 'Finance' means money lending, so
it’s very easy to understand.  
My mother borrowed money here to cover living expenses and my father's
medical treatment.  
Even though it’s just a block from the main street, the building has a
nice appearance. I don't think my mother could have ever imagined
something like this to happen.  
Even so.  
  
“It's strange.”  
  
They didn't even try to hide their suspicious nature, entering the town
through the main gate.  
And heading straight back to their hideout (as their leader called it)
seems incredibly careless.  
Or rather, it seems the town tolerates this kind of behavior.  
  
“Their connection to the higher-ups… huh…”  
  
The leader's statement about strengthening their relationship with the
higher-ups is also concerning.  
Considering everything that’s happened up until now, it seems a little
overdone to just be a scheme to sell off my beautiful mother… but then
again, my mother is beautiful like a goddess, after all.  
Regardless, what I need to do now is…  
  
“Jump!”  
  
I kicked the ground hard and used \[Flight\].  
My body floated lightly, free from gravity, and I soared to the roof of
the three-story wooden building.  
  
“Safe.”  
  
Both feet planted firmly on the roof.  
I know there are at least six debt collectors in this building, maybe
more.  
I could confidently enter from the front door and take them down one by
one, but if there are too many of them, some might escape.  
Since they haven't noticed my presence and are off guard, I want to take
them all down at once.  
One option is to blow up the building, but I want to ask them
something.  
So I want to take out everyone inside without being noticed from the
outside.  
The strategy I came up with was—  
  
“Cat’s Claws!”  
  
As I spoke, I gestured towards the roof.  
The \[Cat's Claws\] activated, and five streaks raced forward.  
And then—  
  
CRASH!  
  
The roof of the three-story wooden building lost its support and
collapsed.  
The power of the \[Cat's Claws\] didn't stop with the roof; it reached
the ground floor.  
That was my plan.  
  
“Renovations complete.”  
  
What a surprise! The ground floor, which was poorly lit and had no hope
of natural light, is now filled with starlight.  
Thanks to the skilled hands of this strongest three-year-old, it's now
an open-plan space with a beautiful view of the starry sky, even from
the first floor!
