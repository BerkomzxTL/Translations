# Chapter 4・My Father Is Healthy Again

I'm so disappointed. Disappointed in myself.  
I was so proud of myself for retrieving the \[Recovery Potion
(Legendary)\] to help my father, but I spilled it all…  
Is this… is this level of despair even possible?  
All I’ve done is soak my father and increase my mother's workload…  
But I won’t be discouraged.  
Because this kind of thing happens all the time in games. Giving up
after one failure won't let you progress the main story. If there's a
boss you can't defeat, just level up and try again.  
Besides, I got an interesting insight out of this.  
  
"Yesterday was a surprise, but you seem to be feeling better today."  
“Yeah. I couldn’t stand getting splashed with water by Reni again.”  
  
Amazingly, my father, who was bedridden until yesterday, is now sitting
up in bed and talking to mother.  
How long has it been since father was able to sit up? I think I can see
tears in my mother's eyes.  
Watching the two of them, I hmm-ed and fell into thought.  
What's going on here?  
I guess it's right to assume the power of the \[Recovery Potion
(Legendary)\] worked after all.  
In other words, I think the potion is effective when administered
orally, but it also works to some extent through the skin.  
However, the effect was still weaker, so even something that should have
instantly restored full health probably only has this much effect.  
  
“This works.”  
  
This is useful.  
I was planning to secretly give it to my father while he was sleeping,
but on second thought, I think it’d be difficult to get him to take it
while he's asleep.  
Soaking him isn't an option, but if I apply it to his skin little by
little, I might be able to secretly heal him… ?  
I can't help but chuckle at my own brilliant idea.  
  
“Reni, did something good happen?”  
  
My always beautiful mother. Lately, she seems a little tired.  
She looked at me and gently stroked my head.  
Don’t worry. Leave it to me! I'll make my father healthy and blow away
my mother's fatigue!  
  
…I thought so, but…  
  
As a result, I ended up soaking my father about five more times.  
A one-year-old's lack of muscle strength is an insurmountable challenge.
It can’t be helped.  
My parents moved all sources of water out of my reach in order to keep
any water away from me. Even when I drink water, they stay by my side
and watch me intently.  
But my father still gets wet. Soaked every time.  
  
“I wonder where Reni gets the water from…”  
“It's so strange…”  
  
I've seen my father and mother tilt their heads like that after I soaked
him.  
Apparently, there's no concept of an item box. My parents didn't seem to
know where I was getting the \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\] from.  
I accidentally opened my status screen in front of my mother once, but
she didn't seem to see it, and didn't say anything to me. Incidentally,
I also opened my item box, but she didn't seem to see that either.  
As I thought, this status screen and item box are concepts only I, the
reincarnated person, possess – kind of like unique skills.  
From the standpoint of whether it's alright to use it in front of
people, that’s very good to know.  
  
“Maybe she’s a water-attribute mage, but maybe she only soaks me because
she hates me…”  
  
My father, completely recovered and able to eat breakfast at the table,
mourned. Mother looked at him and laughed.  
  
“She’s probably just playing a prank because she likes you.”  
“…Really?”  
"Yes, that's right."  
  
Encouraged by my mother’s words, he nodded, “I see.”  
Then, he lifted me, who had been sitting in a chair, onto his lap.  
  
“Reni has grown so much.”  
“Two!”  
  
Two years old, two years old.  
While I continued to splash Father with \[Recovery Potions
(Legendary)\], I turned two years old.  
Even so, my pronunciation of the "st" is still as weak as ever. Compared
to when I was one and said things like “shtatush!”, I think I've made
significant progress, but even at two, my pronunciation isn't great yet.
The "st" sound is formidable.  
  
"Well then, I’m off."  
  
Saying that, my father got up from his chair, firmly holding me in his
arms. Yes! Father has recovered enough to work.  
  
"Please be careful."  
  
My mother followed him anxiously as he headed to the entrance while
carrying me in his arms. Although his body has recovered, the whole
thing started with a failed monster hunt. His illness stemmed from that
injury, so my mother's concern is understandable.  
However, my father earning money as a hunter is better than mother
working from morning till late at night, so he decided to return to
hunting.  
  
“Reni, take care of Mama.”  
“It's awight! Weave it to me!”  
  
My father, entrusting my body to mother, spoke to me. So I nodded firmly
in reply. The strongest two-year-old is here, so there’s no need to
worry.  
  
“Mama, Papa is okay.”  
  
I also told my mother, who is hugging me, to rest assured.  
In fact, I've secretly given father accessories that nullify status
ailments and provide constant health recovery. He doesn't know, but the
decorative cord around his left arm is responsible for that. I also put
a wooden doll in his coat pocket that will substitute for him once if he
falls into a critical state.  
I secretly did both, so the effects haven't been noticed. I think it's
unlikely that father will end up in the same state as before, or face
life-threatening danger from monster attacks.  
  
“That’s right. Reni, let’s wait together with Mama.”  
“Ya”  
  
Mother and I waved at my father's back as he headed off to work. My
mother gently stroked my head and set me down. Then, she immediately
started on the housework.  
My mother’s current daily routine involves working at a bakery early in
the morning, followed by all the household chores. She also works in the
field and takes on sewing work that she got through a connection.  
Compared to when she was walking to town and working at an inn, it might
be a little easier, but it still seems like she’s working tirelessly
with little sleep.  
My father also leaves home in the morning and doesn't return until late
at night. It's not because he's out playing; he really hunts monsters
from morning till night.  
  
—It’s not easy to dig yourself out of poverty.  
  
I thought that if my father got better, things might improve… but it
seems that living in this world is surprisingly expensive.  
I thought I knew everything about this world from my past life, but I
didn't consider living expenses or food costs, so this is a new
discovery.  
In that case.  
  
“Mama, Reni go outside!”  
“Are you going to the garden?”  
“Ya”  
“Mama will go as soon as this is over, so can Reni be a good girl and
wait?”  
“Ya”  
“Keep the door open so you can call Mama right away if anything
happens.”  
“Awight! Weave it to me!”  
  
I nodded with a smile at my busy mother and toddled towards the
entrance. As mother instructed, I left the door open so she could sense
my presence from inside. However, while she can sense my presence, she
won't be able to see what I'm actually doing.  
  
“It’s chance!”  
  
It's my chance!  
I can launch Plan Two, which I devised for our poor and busy family!  
  
“Mama too, twying... but...”  
  
The small field right outside the entrance.  
That's our family's field, but somehow none of the plants look healthy.
I guess the soil’s been ruined because we've been growing vegetables
continuously on just this small plot of land.  
If I get a ton of S-grade materials here and have a bumper crop of
potatoes and carrots, our poverty problem should be solved.  
Leave it to me, the strongest two-year-old!  
  
—Let's spread \[Fertilizer (Legendary)\] on the field!
