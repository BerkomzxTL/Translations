# Chapter 64・I Am Me

For the fourth time today. Concentrating intensely, I enveloped the five
Living Mail that were heading towards Samyu.  
The metallic armor clattered against the stone tile floor, the sound
echoing.  
Taking advantage of the distraction, Samyu slipped out the door  
She'll surely go to help the children.  
  
"Hah!"  
  
Pio was sewing a Living Mail with a hole in its stomach to the floor.  
Leaving the immobilized Living Mail behind, Pio charged at Gaillard
again, but was blocked by a newly arrived Living Mail.  
  
"Ugh…"  
"Pio, over here!"  
"Got it!"  
  
There are twelve Living Mail that have been turned into light. However,
I sensed a massive number of Living Mail still lurking behind
Gaillard.  
I don't have the power to return all of them to light… not now.  
The heat in my chest, which had surged after seeing Carrie cry, is
barely there, and I can probably only do it once more.  
  
"Pio. Carrie, please."  
  
I entrusted Carrie to Pio, who came to my side.  
  
"Your Highness, I apologize for this."  
"Pio… I'm so glad you're alive."  
"I was saved by Her Highness and Reni."  
  
The two quickly exchange greetings, confirming each other's safety.  
Though their words were few, I could understand that they have a strong
connection.  
Then, an out-of-place sound of applause echoed.  
  
"What a wonderful bond between master and servant."  
  
It was Count Gaillard who clapped.  
He said this with a calm face and a calm voice.  
  
"However, I am interested in that beastkin child. I never would have
imagined that you were the one with such power..."  
  
Count Gaillard's grey eyes look at me.  
I met his gaze—  
  
"I see."  
  
I nodded to myself.  
It feels like the first time our eyes have met. And in that moment, my
chest felt a surge of anger.  
If Count Gaillard and I had met like this before, the \[Detection Bell\]
would have rung.  
Count Gaillard at the tea party truly had no interest in me.  
  
"Do you know anything about the dragon?"  
"By dragon, you mean the Earth Dragon that attacked the princess. The
dragon was supposed to be guarding a jewel underground, but when I
sought it out, it was already gone."  
"Did you steal it?"  
"No. I simply stated in front of the dragon that a child possessed the
jewel, and that it might be Princess Carrie, the Third Princess of our
kingdom. Dragons are highly intelligent for monsters. It's not
surprising that it thought to attack Her Highness."  
  
Count Gaillard spoke as if it was someone else’s problem.  
The dragon's jewel was obtained by my father and Samyu for my mother.  
The dragon likely came to the surface to retrieve the jewel after
hearing Gaillard's words.  
Count Gaillard didn't control the dragon, but he undoubtedly incited it
to attack Carrie.  
  
"It is said that the child of God becomes stronger through trials. If
the Princess is the child of God, I thought that an encounter with a
dragon would certainly be the trigger. Therefore, when I heard that the
Princess was attacked by the dragon and survived, my heart leaped with
joy."  
  
He spoke with a calm face.  
  
"After actually hearing the detailed story, I was deeply moved. An elf,
a descendant of the goddess, protected the child. This is precisely the
child of God as prophesied."  
  
Gaillard was was searching for the child of God.  
He must have been very happy upon hearing that a child capable of
defeating the dragon existed.  
And the one who appeared was me, wearing the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\].  
  
"However, contrary to my expectations, Her Highness the princess invited
a cat beastkin child. I was truly disappointed. There's no way a
beastkin child could be the child of God."  
  
Count Gaillard shrugged in exasperation.  
Then, he looked at me intently.  
  
"―Who are you?"  
  
His grey eyes probed me.  
  
"To find the child of God, I thoroughly investigated the records of
every child born at that time. There was no name like yours. I should
have investigated beastkin children as well."  
  
I tilted my head at that.  
  
"Reni isn’t registered."  
"What?"  
  
My reply caused Gaillard's calm face to crumble into a dumbfounded
expression.  
My father and mother had secretly hidden me.  
That's why Gaillard and the others never found me.  
  
"Race is irrelevant."  
  
The village priest also said it was because she's an elf, because I'm a
beastkin. But I don't think it has anything to do with me.  
My status shows my race as Elf. However it's currently sealed, and I'm
no different from a human. If I equip items, I'm the same as a cat
beastgirl. And above all—  
—Not of this world.  
  
As a reincarnated person, I'm a foreign body in this world.  
If asked who I am, I'd say I’m probably nothing.  
  
"Reni is Reni."  
  
Who am I?  
It's simply that I am me.  
Is there anything else that matters?  
  
"You're quite amusing."  
  
Gaillard laughed aloud.  
Then, returning to his calm expression, he extended his hand towards
me.  
  
"You are the child of God. You have power. Those with power should use
it meaningfully."  
  
His hand beckoned me.  
  
"Can you see the stained glass? That is the former royal capital,
Riwander. It was a very beautiful city. I am a descendant of the royal
family. With your power, let's purify the ghosts and rebuild the nation.
You can have the kingdom."  
  
Gaillard spoke eloquently, as if dreaming.  
  
"We don't need wandering ghouls or flying hellbirds. We don't need the
ghosts of commoners. The Living Mail are vessels for the souls of
knights, and fit for a king to command. With this power, we can take
back the kingdom once again."  
  
He smiled at me.  
It was a gentle and kind smile.  
  
"You will be the first queen."  
"Queen?"  
"Let's build it together."  
  
Seeing that smile, I—  
  
"I don't need it."  
  
I shook my head.  
  
"Reni doesn't like you."  
  
Making Carrie cry.  
The words he's been saying to me.  
None of it resonates in my heart.  
  
"Don't want a kingdom."  
  
I'm going to enjoy traveling in this world.  
I don't want to get a kingdom.  
  
"……I guess she’s just a child after all."  
  
At my words, Count Gaillard's eyes flashed briefly.  
The light quickly disappeared, and he sighed deeply.  
  
"It's a great pity."  
  
Then, he retracted his outstretched hand and gestured behind him.  
A large number of Living Mail began to move.  
The count is… 30?  
  
"There were this many…!"  
"They're increasing…"  
  
Pio and Carrie gasped.  
I nodded firmly to reassure them both.  
  
"It's okay. Reni is strong."  
  
And I then leaped forward.  
Now that it's come to this, there's no need to involve the two of
them.  
  
"I really wanted to turn them into light, but…"  
  
But, it seems impossible for me right now.  
So, I extended the claws of the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] with a snap.  
I have no choice but to blow them all away at once!  
  
"Reni! You can't! That's…!!"  
  
As soon as I landed, Carrie's voice echoed behind me.  
Then, as if to drown it out, Count Gaillard laughed.  
  
"To willingly jump in yourself! I don't need your body! The jewel is
mine!!"  
  
Along with his laughter, the floor began to glow.  
This is… a magic circle?  
  
"You're standing in the center of a magic circle that will erase your
body and leave only your soul! Now, jewel! Appear before me!"
