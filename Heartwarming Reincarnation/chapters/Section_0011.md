# Chapter 11・\[Cat's Paw Gloves\] Are Strong

"One down."  
  
I was worried about what would happen if the recoil from the shockwave
hit me, but thankfully, the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] worked perfectly. There
was no recoil, and I was completely unaffected.  
  
"Wh-what was that...?"  
"What the heck...?"  
  
The two remaining debt collectors, their eyes following the trajectory
of the star-bound debt collector, gaped in astonishment.  
I turned to face them, clasped my hands together, and squeezed.  
Depending on how much pressure I apply, a squeaky sound can be heard
from the cute pink paws.  
  
"Hey, what did you just do?"  
"A punch."  
"Huh?"  
"Please give me the IOU."  
"Damn it! Don't underestimate adults!!"  
  
Even though I answered properly and politely, the debt collector's
temples throbbed with anger.  
One of them shouted and ran towards me.  
While watching him, I calmly extended the claws on my left \[Cat's Paw
Glove\].  
You see, cats can extend and retract their claws, right? These \[Cat’s
Paw Gloves\] have that function too, and I can control the claws at
will.  
So...  
  
"Cat's Claws!"  
  
As I watched the debt collector, who seemed to be taking a while to get
to me, I raised my left hand. Then, even though he hadn't reached me, I
swung downwards in a diagonal slash, tearing through the space.  
At that moment, the space split into five, and the resulting attacks
headed straight for the debt collector—  
  
"Become a star!"  
"Gwaaaaaah!!!"  
  
—Twinkle!  
  
The debt collector charging towards me was swallowed by the slicing wind
and blown away into the sky.  
  
"That makes two."  
  
I looked up at the sky and nodded thoughtfully.  
\[Cat's Claws\] is a close-range attack. However, thanks to the added
stacked enhancements, I can create a wind current for a mid-range
attack. It worked perfectly again.  
  
"Y-you..."  
  
The last one. I looked at the remaining debt collector, clasped my hands
together, and squeezed. Again, the pink paw pads made a squeaky sound.  
  
"Give me the IOU."  
  
Just to be safe, I deliberately left the one who acted the most superior
for last.  
Hopefully, he has the IOU and will hand it over without a fight...  
He was sitting down, seemingly with his legs gone weak. As I approached
him, his face turned visibly pale.  
  
"O-okay, wait, I'll give it. ...I'll give it!!"  
  
He said that while raising his hands in surrender.  
Since all I wanted was the IOU, I obediently stopped exactly where I
was.  
He let out a relieved sigh and frantically searched around his chest. He
reached into his vest's inner pocket; that's where the IOU must be.  
  
"Here, look, is this it!? Or is it this one!?"  
  
He showed me two IOUs.  
I don’t understand the details, but they’re long documents, with names
and blood seals at the bottom. One was—my mother's name. The other
was—who is this?  
...Wait, could it be? The debt of the partner who sold out my father, as
the debt collectors mentioned?  
My father supported not only our family, but also the family of his
friend (who seems to be dead now), so I guess I should take this too.  
  
"Are these all the IOUs for this village?"  
"Eh, ah...the IOUs for this village...? No, there are still..."  
  
The debt collector mumbled in response to my question. Apparently,
there's more, but these two will do for now.  
  
"Look, here it is, I'll put them down."  
  
He placed the two IOUs on the ground and weighed them down with a stone
on top.  
Ah, I see. He's asking me to come and get them.  
As I took a step closer, the debt collector hurriedly stood up. His
wobbly legs were fine now. He slowly backed away, stopping about 1.5
meters from the IOUs.  
  
—A trap.  
  
By putting the IOUs on the ground, it forces me to bend down to pick
them up. Bending down makes it difficult to use the \[Cat Punch\] or
\[Cat's Claws\].  
He's probably planning to escape while I'm bending down... or maybe,
since he stopped at 1.5 meters, he's planning to jump and grab me.  
I could tell him to bring them to me, but...  
  
"I'll get them."  
  
Very well. Let's fall into his trap.  
After all, I'm only three. If he runs off with the IOUs, it'll be hard
to chase him.  
The \[Cat Claws\] might work, but if they hit, the IOUs might fly away
too. I want to keep them on hand.  
  
"Ah, there..."  
  
The debt collector indicated the IOUs with his chin.  
I nodded and approached. The moment I bent down to pick up them up—  
  
"Hehe!! You really are just a kid!!"  
  
I heard the debt collector's laughter and the sound of his feet kicking
the ground. He's probably jumping at me.  
Without even glancing at him, I moved something near my tailbone.  
  
"Cat's Tail!"  
  
Covered in fluffy fur, the smooth-moving, long, slender tail struck the
man who had jumped at me in the chest. And then――  
  
"Become a star!"  
"Hi-gyaaaaah!!!"  
  
—Twinkle  
  
The man, struck by the whip-like motion, was blown away into the sky.  
  
"Good. Last one."  
  
As expected of me. The strongest three-year-old.  
I puffed out my chest with satisfaction, and the triangular ears on top
of my head wiggled.
