# Chapter 42・The Red Haired Knight

"Wasn't that a bit too disrespectful towards Her Highness?"  
  
The princess—When I called out to Princess Carrie suddenly, words
descended from above. Then, I was pushed sharply backward.  
  
"Waaah…"  
"Lady Reni!"  
  
Because I was pushed, I stumbled backward.  
Samyu quickly lent me a hand and gently supported me.  
I lowered the hand that had become separated from Carrie and looked up
at the person in front of me.  
That figure—  
  
"A knight?"  
  
Dull gray yet gleaming light armor and a sword at her waist.  
A female knight with her red hair tied up high in a ponytail.  
I think she's a strikingly beautiful woman with a sharp face, but what's
with the suddenness?  
As I tilted my head, a voice echoed from behind the red-haired knight.  
  
"Stop it!"  
"But…"  
"I said it's fine. Step aside!"  
"……Yes!"  
  
Carrie spoke harshly to the red-haired knight. Anger tinged her
dignified voice.  
At that, the red-haired knight shifted to the side, seemingly
resigned.  
  
"Reni! Are you alright? My knight was rude…!"  
"No, I'm fine. Samyu was there for me."  
  
That's right. I was a little surprised, but Samyu supported me, so it
was nothing.  
So, I nodded to Carrie, who seemed flustered.  
As for Samyu, who supported me…  
  
"Who do you think you are, a mere human? You summoned her, and she could
have ignored you, yet Lady Reni came here with such a magnanimous heart.
It seems you were absent when she was attacked by a dragon. Who do you
think saved the princess? Her escort knights were all wiped out. The
carriage was broken, and the horses were injured. Who do you think saved
them all?"  
  
Standing in front of the red-haired knight, she directly confronted her.
The knight is taller. But Samyu didn't flinch at all, looking straight
into her eyes.  
And while keeping eye contact, she continued to speak dispassionately.
There was no intonation in her voice, but a cold aura emanated from her
body.  
…Yeah. She's really angry.  
  
"Who is being rude? I don't think you want your own knight to act like
this towards Lady Reni. Don't you understand your Lady’s wishes?"  
"……If you say any more, I'll have to retort."  
  
Ah, the red-haired knight is angry too….  
Her brows furrowed sharply, and her red eyes, the same color as her
hair, burned as she glared at Samyu. Samyu stared back impassively—  
Mmm. This atmosphere is bad.  
So.  
  
"Samyu. I, uh, want to hold hands."  
"——!? Yes! With pleasure!"  
  
Samyu, who had been glaring fiercely, immediately turned to me at my
request. Then, she clasped my hand tightly.  
  
"Samyu, calm down."  
"Yes!"  
  
With cat paws, I gently squeezed and released Samyu's hand. My paws must
feel soft and squishy.  
As expected, Samyu's coldness has disappeared, and she's breathing
deeply, going suu-haa, suu-haa. Yes, this is the usual, somewhat strange
Samyu. Her anger has subsided.  
I'm alright, but is the red-haired knight alright? Looking over there, I
could hear Carrie's anxious voice.  
  
"Pio, don't make me say it again! Step back!"  
"……Yes!"  
  
This time, the red-haired knight really did leave at Carrie’s words.  
And Carrie, her face pale, squeezed her hands tightly.  
  
"I'm truly sorry… I…"  
  
Her voice trailed off so much that I couldn't hear the end.  
  
"Calling you Carrie isn't okay?"  
"No! That's not true!!"  
"Great. Carrie, call me Reni too."  
"Yes…!"  
  
I don't understand about rudeness or not, but Carrie says it's okay, and
I said it's okay, so it's okay. No problem.  
Then, Carrie furrowed her brows, as if suppressing something.  
  
"A-and… R-Reni!"  
"Hm?"  
"Thank you…!"  
"Mhm."  
  
I don’t know what she was thanking me for, but I nodded and I said I
understood.  
Suddenly cheers rose from behind Carrie.  
  
"Amazing…! Even getting past Lady Pio’s overprotectiveness; finally
someone who can speak naturally to Her Highness…!”  
"That's wonderful, thank goodness! Your Highness!"  
"Finally, Your Highness…!"  
  
The women in uniform were very happy with my interaction with Carrie.  
And the two men next to Carrie spoke up, as if to change the
atmosphere.  
  
"Knights are serious people, you see!"  
"I don't think we should be interfering with the precious exchange
between Her Highness the Princess."  
"Exactly! We have something we prepared especially for today, come,
come!"  
  
Then we were led to a gazebo. It had white pillars and a white roof. The
floor seems paved with something like marble. Beautiful flowers bloomed
in the surrounding shrubs, and a sweet fragrance wafted around.  
Those who entered the gazebo were me, Samyu, Carrie, three women in
uniform, and two men. The red-haired knight stood outside the gazebo, as
if to guard it.  
In the center of the gazebo were a large table and five chairs. Samyu
and I sat side by side, with the two men in front of us. Carrie sat
diagonally across from me.  
And on the table was—  
  
"Lots of sweets."
