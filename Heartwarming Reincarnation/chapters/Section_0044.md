# Chapter 44・There Is Supposedly a Prophecy

“…I’ve been targeted by someone for a long time.”  
  
Carrie’s confession made Samyu and I exchange glances.  
So, was the reason the dragon attacked the carriage because of Carrie?  
  
“There have been a lot of accidents in the palace, and people around me
have been going missing. But I never imagined I’d be attacked by a
dragon…”  
  
I pondered Carrie’s words.  
  
“Carrie~, are you being targeted because you’re a princess?”  
  
I asked, thinking it might be because of her status as a princess. Then,
Thomas, the mayor, who had remained silent until now, shook his head.  
  
“She’s being targeted because of that prophecy!”  
“A prophecy?”  
“That’s right! It’s a complete nuisance…”  
  
What is this prophecy?  
I’d never heard of it and tilted my head. Then, Count Gaillard slowly
spoke.  
  
“*‘One who possesses the treasure of God shall appear.’*”  
  
A soft expression.  
His voice sounded entranced.  
  
“Five years ago, a religious order devoted to the goddess received a
divine revelation. Goddess worship is common in our kingdom, but this
newly formed organization seeks a stronger faith. That’s the
difference.”  
  
Count Gaillard, still with a gentle expression, shifted his gaze to
Carrie—  
  
“It is believed that Her Royal Highness is that person.”  
  
—He revealed that the prophecy refers to Carrie.  
Upon hearing that, Carrie furrowed her brows even tighter.  
  
“Because I was born around the time that religious order received the
prophecy. But unlike my older brother and sister, I possess nothing. My
hair and eyes are a plain brown. I don’t have any special powers.”  
  
Her voice trembled slightly.  
Carrie denied being the person in the prophecy.  
Then, as if in agreement, Mayor Thomas stroked his white beard and
nodded vigorously.  
  
“That revelation is utter nonsense! Your Highness has nothing to worry
about!”  
“I know. Not everyone believes in the prophecies of this new cult. But I
understand that some people are thinking, ‘Maybe…’ Those who meet me
look at me with curious, appraising eyes… And then, after seeing my
appearance and abilities, they leave disappointed.”  
  
Carrie looks distressed.  
Since we met, she’s seemed insecure, constantly denying herself. That’s
probably why. She’s been subjected to unwarranted expectations and
subsequent disappointment.  
Seeing people change their expressions and attitudes over something
beyond her control must be painful.  
  
“Furthermore, unnatural accidents have increased around me, and several
maids and knights have disappeared.”  
  
Her pained, trembling voice grew fainter…  
  
“I attract trouble, despite my unremarkable appearance and lack of
abilities. That’s who I am…”  
  
Her voice trailed off.  
Yet, Carrie still resolutely looked ahead.  
  
“That’s why I cherish my maids and my knight Pio, who have stayed by my
side. …Reni, I’m truly sorry about earlier.”  
  
Carrie is referring to when the red-haired knight pulled me away from
her while we were holding hands.  
I understand that it’s difficult to become close friends with Carrie. I
think her statement, “This is the first time I’ve had this much fun,” is
related to this.  
A normal four-year-old would be intimidated. She is a princess, after
all. But I—  
  
“Reni thinks it’ll be okay.”  
  
—am the strongest four-year-old.  
  
“And, I understand.”  
  
The reason the maids support Carrie.  
The reason the red-haired knight is wary of me.  
  
“Because Carrie is precious. I’m worried about her.”  
  
Everyone loves Carrie.  
  
“That’s wonderful.”  
  
I think Carrie has gone through a lot of hardship.  
It’s good that she has people who she can rely on.  
  
“Reni also loves Carrie.”  
“….!? Eh!?”  
  
Carrie’s cheeks flushed red at my words.  
  
“Carrie’s brown hair is cute, like chocolate.”  
  
Fluffy brown hair.  
The same color as the chocolate she treated me to today.  
I think it’s very cute.  
  
“Carrie’s brown eyes are beautiful, like black tea.”  
  
Clear brown eyes.  
The same color as the rose-scented tea she prepared today.  
I think they’re very beautiful.  
  
“Carrie’s heart is pure and cool.”  
  
A proud spirit, her determination to persevere.  
Her beautiful curtsy when she greeted me today.  
She loses confidence because she strives to do her best. I think that’s
really cool.  
  
“I… I… that’s not true…!”  
“You don’t believe what Reni says?”  
"T-That's not it!"  
“Reni loves Carrie.”  
“B-but… !?”  
"...You can't believe it?"  
"T-That's not the point...!?"  
“Reni loves Carrie.”  
  
Since she kept denying what I said, I’ll repeat it until she believes
me.  
Then, Carrie blushed crimson, her eyes welling up, and she shouted,
“Enough!!”  
  
“I understand!! I understand! I understand, so…”  
“Really?”  
“Really!”  
  
Carrie has the most desperate expression I’d ever seen.  
Mhm. I'm glad I got my point across.  
  
“…Thank you, Reni.”  
  
Carrie tightly closed her tear-filled eyes.  
Tears threatened to spill.  
But she quickly opened her eyes, looking upward.  
And then―  
  
“What… is that?”  
  
Carrie’s brown eyes focused on a single point.  
Then, I heard it—the sound of a bell.  
  
“From the sky, an enemy.”  
  
The \[Detection Bell\] attached to my waist chimed.  
Everyone looked up, and there—  
  
“Armor.”  
  
—Something in full plate armor was descending from the sky.
