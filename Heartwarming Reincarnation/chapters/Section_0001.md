# Chapter 1・I Love Games

I'm a perfectly ordinary high school girl.  
  
...Or at least I wish I could say that. The truth is, I'm a
hikikomori.  
Ever since I was little, I always felt out of place when I was around
other people. I felt like I didn't quite fit in. That feeling only
resonated stronger as I grew older. By the time I was in junior high
school, I couldn't go to school anymore.  
Although I did take the high school entrance exam, I still couldn't fit
in, and now I'm just technically enrolled, with a failing grade meaning
I’ll have to redo the year. That means there's no point in going to
school.  
Instead of going to school, I immerse myself in games.  
  
I'm hooked on an online RPG.  
I chose an elf for my character, with silver hair and golden eyes. From
the moment I started the game, I poured all my spare time into it. Part
of it was because I had nothing else to do, but mostly because the game
was incredibly fun.  
  
I didn't join any specific teams, and barely ever used the chat
function. I prefer solo play.  
Defeat monsters, gather materials, craft equipment, raise my stats, and
clear main quests.  
I played almost non-stop, quickly reaching the maximum level, getting
the best equipment, and filling my item box to capacity.  
Even then, I never got bored of the game. The developers held lots of
events, and they weren't just simple time-wasters; they’re always clever
and engaging.  
  
One day, I logged in as usual and was mining in a map called the Spirit
Cave.  
In cave maps, if you have a pickaxe, you can mine minerals.  
Collecting these mineral materials is called "mining," and while the
minerals you find in the Spirit Cave are useful in the mid-game, I’ve
already maxed out on them.  
So why am I here?  
  
—Because I'd found information about a rare item online.  
  
But I don't think a normal person would have understood the information.
It was something only someone who knew a certain secret could decipher.
That's the kind of information it was.  
While watching a mid-level player mine at a material point in the cave,
I ventured deeper. I quickly defeated the cave boss and went even
further in.  
  
"After defeating the boss, follow the right wall without collecting the
materials..."  
  
—At first glance it just looks like a normal cave wall.  
But my character started phasing into the wall—  
  
"There's a hidden passage."  
  
I think only very few people know about this.  
As my character completely phased into the wall, the screen went dark
for a while. During that time, I couldn't see what my character is
doing, and it's unsettling, but I kept moving forward. Then, the light
returned to the screen—  
  
"I've arrived."  
  
The Spirit Cave. A small room in a hidden passage.  
This is the only room on the map.  
A wooden floor, white walls, and lamps with magical light.  
I don't know why a cave map would suddenly change like this. It's too
well-made to be a bug, so I think the developers did it intentionally.  
  
But there’s nothing here.  
  
When I first discovered it, I was excited, thinking there might be a
powerful boss, a treasure chest, or maybe a path to a different map, but
no matter how much I searched, I found nothing.  
I even spent a whole day in the room, thinking it might be time-related,
and I visited every day, thinking it might be day-related.  
A year went by.  
In the end, there was nothing there and I had given up, but it seems
there was something there after all.  
The online information was very brief:  
  
*'In the small cave room, mine on Christmas (Legendary)'*  
  
The information was too vague, and it was ignored.  
However, if you know that this is the "cave room," the story becomes
much more believable.  
  
"Mine with a pickaxe on Christmas..."  
  
I tried coming on Christmas, and I tried digging with a pickaxe, but I
might never have tried doing both at the same time. What a lapse of
judgement on my part.  
By the way, it's not just any pickaxe. It has to be a pickaxe
(Legendary).  
You gather materials and craft tools through item synthesis, and they
have ranks.  
There are five ranks: (Rag), (Average), (Superior), (Exceptional), and
(Legendary).  
Each has unique properties, but the pickaxe (Legendary) guarantees at
least SS-grade materials. However, it breaks after one use.  
Crafting a pickaxe (Legendary) requires a lot of S-grade materials, so
most people don't use them because it's not worth it.  
But I have plenty of S-grade materials, so I use them often.  
  
"Okay, let's try it."  
  
I swallowed hard.  
December 25th. Christmas. Endless mining in the small cave room!  
Even though it's a small room, there are many places to dig a hole. In
fact, the entire floor is a mining spot, so if I want to check
everything, I'll need to dig a hundred times. A pickaxe (Legendary)
breaks after one use, so I need a hundred of them, but that's fine with
me.  
So, I started in the center of the room and swung the pickaxe
(Legendary). It pierced the wooden floor.  
But—  
  
"...Nothing happened."  
  
I didn't expect it to work on the first try, but I’m still a little
disappointed.  
The status screen only said, 'The \[Pickaxe (Legendary)\] broke.' Just
like always. It’s supposed to guarantee SS-grade materials, but no
matter how much I mined here, I never got any items, and the pickaxe
just broke.  
  
"Next."  
  
But this kind of thing happens often when playing games.  
I quickly cheered myself up and started again, moving from the upper
right, slowly swinging the pickaxe. I don’t care if I break all one
hundred pickaxes.  
And so, time passed as the pickaxes just kept breaking. I had already
finished half of the room and was in the latter half. In the lower-right
area, slightly below the center, I swung my pickaxe down at a spot with
no particular markings, and then it happened.  
  
"W—! An original effect—!"  
  
It worked!  
The information was true—!  
  
"Amazing! I've never seen an effect like this!"  
  
Even after playing this game for so long, there's still a world I don't
know about.  
  
—That's why I can't stop.  
—That's why I love it so much.  
  
The wooden floor was cracked where the pickaxe struck, and light poured
out from the cracks. The light spread throughout the small room, and the
screen turned into a pure white space. There, my elf character with
silver hair and golden eyes stood, and in her hand was—  
  
"An orb...?"  
  
She’s holding something like a round crystal.  
Was there an item like that...?  
As I wondered, the screen changed, and I found myself back in the Spirit
Cave boss area.  
And a line of text was added to the status screen—  
  
*'You obtained the \[Jewel (Legendary)\].'*  
  
I did it...!  
I’m so happy.  
However, the item wasn't in my item box, and it’s not listed as
equipment or an accessory either. My stats haven’t changed, and I didn't
get any new titles.  
It doesn’t exist anywhere.  
But there was definitely an original effect, and it appeared in the
status screen.  
So there's no doubt I got it.  
  
—What kind of effect does it have?  
—Maybe there are more jewels sleeping in this world.  
  
Thinking about that, I felt excited.  
I was sure I could still enjoy this game for a long time, and for the
first time in a while, I decided to sleep in my bed.  
And then—  
  
—I apparently died in my sleep.  
  
That's just too messed up...!
