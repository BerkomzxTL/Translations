# Chapter 77・Reni Is a Genius 2

Samyu and Hasano. What happened before their eyes was terrifying.  
The Elven Forest was burning. Reni used her power to extinguish the
flames.  
…It was fine up to that point.  
But Reni's power continued to overflow even after she put out the fire.
The light emanating from Reni intensified, and her body began to fade.  
—Reni's body flickered, and her eyes remained closed.  
Samyu and Hasano desperately called out to her. Then, \[The Black
Bahamut Dragon\], who saw this, stepped forward and contained Reni's
light.  
  
"Reni, what happened?"  
  
Reni opened her eyes and looked up at Samyu and Hasano with a puzzled
expression.  
Then, after hearing about her condition, she closed her eyes again.  
  
"It's good that the Elven Forest is safe."  
  
Reni was primarily concerned with whether the flames had been
extinguished.  
Hasano, the Elf Queen, had already received a report from the Elves.
Reni's power had enveloped the entire Elven Forest, and the flames were
extinguished.  
Upon hearing this, Reni smiled with satisfaction...and perhaps a little
relief.  
  
"I did it…"  
  
And just like that, she began to doze off.  
This time, her body didn't flicker. It was the same state as before
Hasano narrowed her \[Mana Pathways\], a state of \[Mana Rampage\].
Despite putting so much effort to cast the spell, the \[Mana Pathways\]
had widened again immediately.  
  
"Samyu… I'll prepare the spell again."  
"…Has Lady Reni suffered another \[Mana Rampage\]?"  
"Yes… Reni used her power recklessly. The \[Mana Pathways\], which I
painstakingly narrowed, can't withstand the surging flow of mana. It's
back to its original state… maybe even worse than before. …Even if her
body feels better, it's not good to use a large amount of mana all at
once. I wanted to tell her that, but I couldn't get to her in time."  
  
Hasano sighed and looked at \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\].  
The spell was so effective that it only ended up putting a strain on
Reni's body.  
The promise Hasano wanted Reni to make was to "not use mana
carelessly."  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] was burning down the forest. Prioritizing
that, Reni used her power before Hasano could give her a warning,
causing another \[Mana Rampage\].  
  
"What's wrong with this vessel…? It's too unstable."  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] let out a weary sigh.  
Hasano's magic rings were removed so that she could teach Reni how to
control her power.  
The dragon released her hand from Reni’s chest, whom Samyu was holding,
and looked down at Reni with suspicion.  
  
"...To start with, it was because you burned down the forest..."  
  
Hasano raised her right index finger, creating a ring of mana around
her.  
She only released her because she said she could somehow save the fading
Reni; she hadn’t forgiven her.  
Looking at her with a suspicious expression, \[The Black Bahamut
Dragon\] held up her hands and shook her head.  
  
"Wait, wait, wait. This time, she didn't disappear, and the mana was
contained, but if things stay as they are, the same thing will happen
again. What would have happened if I hadn't been there? Is that okay?"  
"...It’s...not okay!"  
  
Samyu, still with tears streaming down her face, hugged Reni tightly.  
Her body was hot. Even though she was experiencing a \[Mana Rampage\],
her body was still there. But a moment ago, she had nearly vanished.  
Because she had been holding Reni all along, Samyu knew. Reni's weight
in her arms had been fading.  
  
If something like this were to happen again—  
If Reni were to disappear—  
  
Tears streamed down Samyu's face, and she hugged Reni even tighter,
seeking escape in the embrace.  
  
"Lady Reni… Lady Reni always tries her best!…Not for herself, but for
others, she gives her all…!"  
  
Samyu choked out the words and squeezed her eyes shut.  
Samyu had met Reni when she was three years old.  
Reni had single handedly destroyed a loan shark's hideout so her parents
could live safely and happily.  
Overflowing with talent, she could do everything herself. She was so
strong that Samyu wondered if she was even needed.  
But Reni said that Samyu was fine just as she was. Let's travel
together, she said.  
And as they traveled together, Samyu realized…  
Reni―  
  
"Lady Reni often says, 'I can do it.' To help others… to use her power
to help, she says. …But she always leaves herself behind. So… even if
she heard Queen Hasano's warning. Even if she were told that using her
power would cause her to disappear…"  
  
Surely, Reni—  
Reni would choose—  
  
"To use her power to save others, not herself. —Lady Reni will
definitely use her power."  
  
Even if Reni had heard Hasano's warning, she would have used her power
to extinguish the flames in the Elven Forest.  
And it's not just now.  
It will happen again in the future…. Reni will always use her power to
save others.  
Samyu understood this painfully well.  
  
"If that's the case… if that's the case, Lady Reni will disappear! Lady
Reni will definitely choose that option…!"  
  
Tears flowed endlessly from Samyu's eyes.  
Reni disappearing. It was something Samyu couldn't accept. She couldn't
allow such a future. But—  
  
"I can't stop her… Lady Reni's safety is the most important thing to me.
There's nothing more important than Lady Reni. …If Lady Reni wishes it…
then I have no choice but to watch her disappear."  
  
—She couldn't stop Reni herself.  
  
Samyu remembered what she had told Pio.  
Pio, even knowing her master's wishes, would not hesitate to stop her
master if she thought it was dangerous.  
But Samyu was different. Even if she thought it was dangerous, if it was
her master's wish, she believed she should fulfill it.  
But now, Samyu wished she could act and speak like Pio. If only she
could live in this small world within Samyu's reach…  
It was inevitable that Reni would take risks. But to just watch her
disappear…  
  
"Is there any need for someone like me, who can only watch as she
disappears just because it's my master's wish…? …I…"  
"Samyu…"  
  
Hasano searched for words to comfort Samyu.  
She had feelings she wanted to express.  
But those words…were words that Reni and Samyu should find together.  
  
"……I'm sorry. This isn't the time to be expressing my feelings. First,
we need to get Lady Reni to a place where she can rest."  
"Yes, that's right."  
  
Samyu said this, and, still holding Reni, stood up.  
They were heading to the room where Reni had been sleeping.  
  
"I'm coming too."  
"——Get lost."  
"This elf's response is quite something…"  
  
Samyu glared at \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] with resentment as she
tried to follow her.  
She wasn't attacking her only because she was holding Reni. But in truth
she wanted to shoot an arrow immediately.  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] is a precious dragon that supports the
world and is on the same level as a goddess. The black dragon, the
foundation of the world, had never expected to be treated like this, and
her face twitched.  
  
"In the first place, I originally came here to search for the \[Jewel\]
that the young elf possessed. The \[Jewels\] that support this world
are, after all, made from my body."  
  
That's right. \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]'s purpose was the Jewel that
Reni possessed.  
  
"Seven Jewels maintain the balance, yet one disappeared from this world.
Four years passed without knowing what happened. Finally, I felt its
power and came to investigate, only to find this."  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] stared at Reni in Samyu's arms.  
She was feverish, her cheeks flushed, her brows furrowed in pain.  
  
"This young elf is too intertwined with the \[Jewel\]. I thought it
would be fine if I could just retrieve the \[Jewel\], or even if I
didn't, as long as it existed in this world…"  
  
It was meant to be a simple investigation.  
To look for the lost \[Jewel\] and observe the current state of the
world.  
But now, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] felt a heavy responsibility.  
  
"If this young elf dies, the \[Jewel\] will be lost from this world
forever."  
  
Seven \[Jewels\].  
If even one were lost—  
  
"The world, with its balance shattered—will perish."
