# Chapter 60・Salmon Swimming Upstream

"Lady Reni, I'll prepare it right away!"  
"Reni, please wait a moment."  
  
They’re both so kind to me.  
The two who called out to me each began their preparations. Samyu took a
chair from the carriage and let me sit down.  
Then, Pio made a fire and seemed to be cooking something.  
There was a stream right next to where we stopped the carriage.  
Samyu prepared water for me to wash my face, let me rinse my mouth, and
helped me get ready.  
  
"Reni, it's ready."  
  
Pio called to me, and I turned to face her.  
A pot was hanging over the campfire, and Pio was stirring it slowly.  
  
"It smells good."  
"Ah. I'm sorry it's simple, but it's breakfast soup."  
  
Pio handed me some soup in a wooden bowl.  
I carefully took it with my cat paws and peeked inside. There was—  
  
"Looks delicious!"  
  
It’s an amber-colored soup. The ingredients were cabbage, dried
tomatoes, and dried meat, I think. The dried meat had absorbed the soup
and looked easy to eat.  
  
"Amazing! Pio, you're a great cook!"  
"Thank you, Reni. But this much is a matter of course for a knight who
regularly camps out."  
"Ideally, it would be best to go into town and have a meal…"  
  
Samyu said that as she held a plate with bread on it.  
  
"There's no table, so it might be difficult to eat, but please let me
know if you want to eat bread."  
"Mhm, thank you."  
  
Samyu said that and handed me a spoon, which I took with my cat paws.  
I ate stew in the village house before, and even with cat paws, I could
manage to hold a spoon.  
I scooped up the soup along with the dried meat. When I put it in my
mouth—  
  
"Delicious!"  
  
The warm soup had just the right amount of salt. The dried meat melted
in my mouth.  
  
"Isn't the dried meat too hard?"  
"The meat, it's not hard. And, it smells good."  
  
I told the worried Samyu, "It's okay."  
The soup was very delicious. The flavor of the dried meat was seeping
out. But, the dried meat wasn't dry or crumbly. There was also a
refreshing flavor, probably because herbs were used. The dried meat
itself was delicious. It was well utilized.  
  
"Amazing, Pio. It's so tasty!"  
  
Pio said it was a knight's skill, but being able to make such a
delicious meal in such a short time surpasses mere skill.  
As I looked at Pio in admiration, something seemed strange—  
  
"Pio…?"  
"Haa… Reni… eating… haa… aa…!"  
  
…Eh?  
  
"Aa… Reni…"  
  
Something is wrong. Something is very wrong.  
Where is the serious and sharp Pio…?  
Pio was breathing heavily, her face flushed red as she stared at me.  
Mmn, to be honest, I'm used to Samyu's heavy breathing. But Pio’s feels
different.  
How should I put it… Samyu's breathlessness is like she's worshipping
me. Pio is… writhing. Yes, writhing.  
  
"Haa… haa…"  
  
Her cheeks were flushed, her brows furrowed in a poignant way. And, she
looked like she might drool…  
I stopped eating the soup and stared at the transformed Pio.  
Then, Samyu shook her head.  
  
"Lady Reni, you mustn't look."  
  
She turned my body, hiding Pio from my view.  
And, with a strong look in her eyes, she declared.  
  
"That's a pervert."  
"Pervert."  
  
…I see?  
Following Samyu's words, I hid my face and slowly peeked at Pio.  
Pio's face was red and she was trembling. She seemed shocked by what
Samyu and I had said, and she was holding her head.  
  
"I, I… I…!!"  
  
A slightly sweaty body and tear-filled eyes. Pio hugged herself tightly,
as if restraining herself.  
  
"Uuu… I'm not… no, I am. I… uuugh…"  
  
Up to that point, Pio stared intently at me.  
Then, she threw off her armor with a clatter—  
  
"I was such a person...!!"  
  
And jumped into the nearby river…  
  
"Pio…"  
  
Why…?  
  
"Lady Reni, that was a salmon in heat."  
"Sal-mon…"  
"It went upstream."  
  
…Salmon die after going upstream to spawn.  
  
"Samyu, Samyu"  
  
It must be my fault that Pio has become so strange.  
  
"Reni did something wrong?"  
  
I think we were just eating, though…  
I became anxious, tugged on Samyu's sleeve, and looked up at her face.  
Then, Samyu stopped breathing—  
  
"Ah, impossible, so precious. Instant death."  
  
—And then her eyes rolled back.  
  
"…Everyone"  
  
…Rest.  
I came all the way here to rescue Carrie. And I'm trying to calm down
before entering the capital and infiltrating. But…  
An elf whose eyes roll back and she can't breathe, and a knight who
pants heavily before swimming upstream.  
I feel like I'm actually using up more energy.  
And I yearn. For someone who will react somewhat normally, no matter
what I do…  
  
"Carrie…"  
  
If I squint, I could see the large gates of the capital.  
I thought Reoliga City from before was pretty big, but this is even
bigger.  
As expected of the capital.  
Beyond the high walls, I saw many houses and a white castle. Is Carrie
in that castle?  
  
―I'm going there now!
