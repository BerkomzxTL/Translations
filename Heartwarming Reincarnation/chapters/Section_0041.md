# Chapter 41・Carrie Finè Langirosa

I decided to go to the tea party, so I wrote a response right away.  
Unlike the princess, I can't write elegant letters, so I simply conveyed
my gratitude and intention to participate.  
Samyu took it to the city hall for me, and she also inquired about the
location and time there.  
So...  
  
"Samyu, is this it?"  
"Yes. Today's tea party seems to be held at the mayor's house here."  
  
The day after arriving in Reoliga City.  
After spending the night at an inn, we found ourselves standing in front
of the mayor's house.  
I’ve already put on the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\], transforming into a cat
beastgirl. My disguise is perfect.  
However...  
  
"It's huge."  
  
I looked up at the mayor's house and let out a sigh.  
Reoliga itself is the largest among the villages and towns I know.
Naturally, the mayor must be rich.  
The entire grounds were surrounded by a high brick wall, with an elegant
wrought-iron gate. Peeking inside, I could see a beautifully landscaped
garden and a large three-story house beyond it. I thought the town
mayor's house in Slanita was big, but this... has a different kind of
quality? Presence? Even in the game, there were houses this large on the
town map that could be explored, but seeing it in reality…  
I was deeply moved and couldn’t help but chuckle.  
  
"This way."  
  
While I was laughing to myself, Samyu and the gatekeeper seemed to have
exchanged words, and one of the two people standing there guided us
inside.  
As we walked through the garden—  
  
"Ah!! O-over here!!!"  
  
A high-pitched voice, typical of a young child. Turning towards the
angry-sounding voice, I saw the person I had expected.  
A girl with fluffy brown hair tied in two pigtails. A red dress that
suited her perfectly.  
According to Samyu, she's the youngest princess of this kingdom.  
  
"I heard your story."  
"To think that it was such a small young lady who saved her from the
dragon!"  
  
Standing next to the princess were two men. One was a middle-aged man
with gray hair slicked back and a gentle expression. The other was an
elderly man with white hair and a white beard, like Santa Claus.  
One of these two must be the lord and the other the mayor.  
…My detection bell isn't ringing.  
For now, I guess it's okay?  
  
"Samyu."  
"Yes. …Then, let's go."  
  
Exchanging a glance with Samyu, we slowly approached.  
Just like yesterday, behind the princess were three women in uniform,
cheering words of encouragement like, "Do your best!"  
We arrived before the princess and the two men and faced each other.  
Then, the princess clenched her fist and took a step forward.  
  
"...Um, uh! I'm so glad you came today!"  
"Mhm."  
"I'm truly grateful for what happened yesterday... And I’m sorry that
the tea party had to be held today.”  
"No, it's okay. Because you sent me a letter."  
  
It was probably impossible to have the tea party yesterday. Considering
that she arrived in Reoliga City, was attacked by a dragon, I saved her,
and she wanted to invite me for tea, it makes sense. Rather, I think
it’s amazing that she was able to schedule it for today.  
Soldiers were already looking for us at the inn in the evening, too.  
So, when I conveyed that it was alright, the princess seemed relieved
and relaxed her clenched fist.  
  
"I’m glad…. I was afraid you might not want to see me again."  
"Reni was looking forward to the tea party."  
"Ah! I-I was too…!"  
  
When I said that, looking into the princess's brown eyes, her cheeks
flushed red.  
Then she clenched her fist again.  
Then, a voice came from behind—  
  
"Your Highness… here, do your self-introduction here!"  
"You can do it!"  
"Fight!"  
"I-I know!"  
  
The princess quickly turned to the women in uniform and nodded.  
Then, turning back to me, she held the hem of her skirt and lowered her
gaze slightly.  
  
"My name is Carrie Finè Langirosa. I am the third child and second
princess of Julius, the current King of the Langirosa Kingdom."  
  
The princess, having said that, lowered her body smoothly, as if in a
bow. But she didn't bend her waist and lower her head like a bow. Her
body's axis remained unbent, and her upper body maintained a beautiful
posture. She was probably skillfully controlling her movements so as not
to look flustered, even while bending her knees under her skirt.  
I've seen this in the game. It's the greeting that princesses and other
elegant people do… !  
Her brown hair fluttered, and the hem of her dress spread beautifully.  
  
"Amazing! Beautiful!"  
  
It was such a beautiful sight that I couldn't help but clap.  
Since I’m in my cat form, it made squeaky sounds.  
  
"I-I'm not beautiful!"  
  
Even though it was a heartfelt statement, the princess hurriedly denied
my words.  
It was such a beautiful greeting, but she stopped herself, which was a
little disappointing.  
  
"Reni thought you were very beautiful."  
"……!"  
"Well, I don't think it's something you can do without lots of practice.
I thought it was amazing."  
"Ah……!"  
  
When I said that, the princess widened her brown eyes and her cheeks
flushed red again.  
  
"Reni can’t do elegant greetings."  
"That doesn't matter at all! You are very, very beautiful!!"  
  
The princess said that, gracefully releasing her hands from her skirt,
and clasped them in front of her chest, shouting.  
She shouted so earnestly that it was funny, and I couldn’t help but
laugh.  
I approached the princess and placed my hands on top of hers, which were
clasped in front of her chest.  
  
"It's Reni. Nice to meet you."  
"Re-ni…. Ah, is it okay to call you by your name?"  
"Mhm."  
"Um, then… you may not want to call me… but…"  
  
The princess's brown eyes wavered with anxiety.  
This happened before. She seems so dignified and strong, but…  
So, I nodded reassuringly.  
  
"That's up to Reni to decide."  
"Yes, that’s right."  
  
Having said that, the princess’ eyes wandered around several times
before shouting resolutely.  
  
"U-um, well…! That! …Carrie!"  
"Mhm."  
"I want you to call me Carrie…!"  
  
The princess closed her eyes tightly after saying that.  
I could feel the tension in the princess's hands that I was holding.  
She must be very nervous.  
So, I gently tightened my grip on her hands to ease her tension.  
  
"Okay."  
  
At my action and words, the princess's brown eyes opened timidly.  
Looking straight into her eyes—  
  
"Let's have a fun tea party."  
  
Okay?  
  
"Carrie~"
