# Chapter 52・I Understand My Father’s Feelings

The priest introduced us to a family living in an ordinary house.  
We apologized for the unexpected visit.  
And yet, the family didn't seem displeased—or rather, it wasn't a matter
of displeasure. Their expressions were simply stiff. The tension is
palpable.  
We were shown into the house, offered a meal, and sat down, but…  
  
*‘Lady Reni, please don't touch any of the food served here.’*  
*‘Is there poison in it?’*  
*‘Well… it’s not necessarily poison, but it wouldn’t be strange if
something were added.’*  
  
In the dining room of the house, there was a large table with six
chairs. Samyu and I, sitting in two of them, were communicating through
\[Telepathy\].  
Something is clearly amiss…  
Samyu is sitting next to me. In front of us sat a middle-aged man. His
wife brought the meal.  
Though there are six chairs, it seems only the couple live here. It’s
already dinner time, yet there's no sign of anyone else in the house.  
  
“P-please,”  
“I-it’s a simple meal, I’m sorry…”  
  
The couple urged us to eat.  
The man’s face was pale, and the woman’s hands were shaking violently.  
…Hmm.  
Samyu told me not to eat. I also think it's better not to eat it. But—  
  
“Thank you for the stew.”  
  
It was a wonderfully appetizing white stew, steaming warmly.  
I suspected it wasn't made for us, but for the couple themselves.  
Then, a call from the priest arrived on short notice, and it was offered
to us. It would have been impossible to make a new one in time.  
  
“It looks delicious.”  
  
Saying this, I picked up the spoon.  
Then, a frantic voice echoed in my mind—  
  
*‘L-Lady Reni!?’*  
*"I think I'll try it."*  
*‘But this is clearly…’*  
*‘Mhm. But it wasn’t made for that.’*  
  
This meal was made to be enjoyed. Our arrival probably ruined that.  
When I think about it like that, I want to enjoy it…  
  
*‘Reni is strong. It’ll be okay if I take medicine right away.’*  
*‘….Lady Reni… understood. But please, use an item immediately if you
feel anything unusual.’*  
*'Mhm.’*  
  
Samyu furrowed her brow with worry.  
However, she didn’t stop me and just nodded.  
  
“Let’s eat.”  
  
It’s hard to hold the spoon with my cat paw, but I carefully grasped it.
When I scooped up the stew, the soup dripped from the spoon into the
bowl. Are these potatoes? I put a spoonful in my mouth—  
  
“It’s so delicious!”  
  
It’s the perfect temperature, not too hot. The fluffy potatoes were
enveloped in soup and went down smoothly.  
The gentle milky aroma, the saltiness, the faint sweetness—all
delicious!  
I put my left cat paw to my cheek. I laughed happily at the
deliciousness, when suddenly, the spoon was pulled from my right hand—  
  
“No…!! Don’t eat it…!!”  
  
The woman who had brought the stew stopped me.  
  
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry… what have I done…!!”  
“…I’m sorry… just get some water…”  
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."  
  
The woman snatched the spoon from me, covered her face with one hand,
and collapsed to the ground.  
The man sitting opposite us stood up and rushed to her side. He didn't
look at me or Samyu, only offering water.  
Yet, the woman didn't stop apologizing...  
  
“What’s in this stew?”  
  
Samyu moved the stew away from me, stood up, and walked toward the
couple.  
They flinched, then the woman whispered softly.  
  
“Sleeping pills… the priest gave them to us…”  
“It’s not a poison that would harm the body?”  
“We were told that. …Just to make you two fall asleep. That’s all they
said.”  
  
Apparently, the stew contains sleeping pills.  
Hearing this, Samyu moved away from the couple and turned to me.  
  
“Lady Reni, are you alright? How do you feel?”  
"Don't worry."  
  
It’s probably a drug with a mild effect; a small amount shouldn’t be a
problem.  
So—  
  
“Reni, eat.”  
  
I put the stew that Samyu had pushed away back in my hand, and grabbed
her spoon. Mine had been taken, after all.  
  
“L-Lady Reni!?”  
  
I heard Samyu's anxious voice, but I tried not to worry about it and ate
it all quickly. While it would have been difficult if it were very hot,
it wasn’t so hot as to burn me, so I gobbled it down. Of course, it was
very delicious.  
I wanted to savor it slowly, but taking too long would allow the
sleeping pills to take effect, which might be bad.  
As I finished the dish, my head began to feel hazy—  
  
“I… item… box…”  
  
…I’m sleepy. More sleepy than I expected…  
This is similar to the feeling when you've pulled consecutive
all-nighters and you're watching an unskippable cutscene for about 5
minutes. It's like my brain is shutting down….  
I managed to mutter the words, and items appeared before me. No good, I
can barely see… but, probably this…  
  
“Con… firm…”  
  
A heavy weight on my chest. Yes, this weight… It’s okay. This.  
My eyes threatened to close with each lapse in concentration. Or rather,
they’re probably already closed.  
So, mustering the last of my strength, I used my cat paw claw to stab
the tip of the heavy weight on my chest. Then, I pulled my paw away,
allowing my sleeping body to lean into the weight—  
  
—Splash!!  
  
“…Cold.”  
  
Cold.  
  
“Lady Reni…”  
“Are you alright!?”  
“Where did that water come from!? Did you spill it from the table!?”  
"Okay, I'll wipe it with something!"  
“R-right!”  
  
I'm soaking wet. Samyu was tearful with worry, and the couple,
forgetting their despair, ran to fetch a cloth to wipe down the soaked
floor and me.  
…Mhm.  
  
“Recovery medicine is amazing.”  
  
I'm no longer sleepy!  
I kept spilling \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\] on my father, and it
certainly worked. Drinking it is probably more effective, but I’ve
proven through personal experience that it works topically too.  
In game terms, it’d be like an instant cure for a status ailment.  
But you know, it’s cold when liquid is poured over your head.  
I’d spilled it on him many times, but I finally understand my father’s
feelings. Recovery medicine should be drunk, not poured. While I was
coming to terms with this, the couple returned with something to wipe me
down.  
Samyu wiped me off as I was soaking wet with tears in her eyes and
helped me get dressed.  
Meanwhile, the couple seemed to have calmed down and bowed to us.  
  
“We are truly sorry.”  
“We are truly, truly sorry.”  
“Mhm.”  
"...But even so, thank you for eating the stew."  
“Mhm. It was delicious.”  
  
When I answered, the woman furrowed her brow.  
  
"If you are sorry for your actions, will you tell us what happened?”  
“…Understood.”  
“Right…”  
  
The couple nodded at Samyu’s words.  
Then, they slowly began to speak.  
  
“This village… is controlled by that cult.”  
“Controlled?”  
“Literally. We have no freedom. If they order us to do something, we
have no choice.”  
  
The couple’s faces were somber.  
A table for six. Six chairs. ...Yet, only the couple live here. The
answer is―  
  
“Our children are being held hostage.”  
  
…The children who should have been there weren't.  
  
“We only see them during morning prayers at the church… So we know
they're there. But we can't do anything…”  
“Didn’t you think of fighting back as a village?”  
“The church outwardly only has one priest. But one day, over a dozen
strong men arrived. Some houses resisted…”  
“The children of those houses… haven’t been seen at prayer time anymore.
…They might not be here anymore…”  
“This village is finished.”  
“I think it's you, an elf, that the church wants to acquire. Escape
quickly. Leave this village…”  
“There's a back door… We’ll guide you.”  
  
The couple nodded at each other.  
They seemed willing to help us escape, but—  
  
“Won’t you get in trouble?”  
  
Helping us escape would mean rebelling against the church.  
  
“The children are at the church, right?”  
  
The couple gasped at my words.  
  
“It’s okay… No, it’s not okay. But I can’t forgive myself for deceiving
you…”  
“…I’m sorry. Please, before we change our minds…”  
“…Before I become a terrible person again, please escape.”  
  
The couple looked down.  
…Their children are being held hostage. How much internal conflict must
they have endured to try and help us escape.  
Samyu and I had noticed. It was a plan doomed to fail from the start.  
But, it would have been better for the couple if they had just left me
to eat the stew with the sleeping drug in it.  
  
“Thank you. For telling us.”  
  
But they stopped me after I took just one bite.  
And now, they had made the decision to help us escape.  
  
“I’ll help.”  
  
Because I’m the strongest four-year-old!  
  
“Leave it to Reni!”  
  
—Let's destroy the church and save the children!
