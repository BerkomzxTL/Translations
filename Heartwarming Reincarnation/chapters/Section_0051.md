# Chapter 51・It’s a Church

Saying goodbye to Carrie and the others, we headed towards the village.
To get some strength training in, I took off my equipment and walked.  
We left Reoliga in the morning and arrived in the evening. I guess it’s
just about time to start preparing for dinner.  
It's a small village compared to Reoliga City. A little bigger than my
parents' village, but not by much. There are houses scattered here and
there.  
  
"This is Niguru Village."  
"Mhm...it's strange."  
"Yes. Does Lady Reni feel it too?"  
  
At the village entrance, Samyu and I exchanged glances.  
At first glance, it's normal. But―  
  
"There's no one around."  
"Yes. At this time of day, there should be people returning home, there
should be children's voices, the sounds of preparing dinner..."  
"It's so quiet."  
  
What is this feeling? It doesn't seem problematic, yet it's eerily
quiet. Like something is hiding...  
  
"I'll become a cat."  
"Yes."  
  
Anyway, I equipped the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and \[Winged Rabbit Boots\].
And one more thing. With this, I'll be safe no matter what happens.  
And so, holding hands with Samyu, we entered the village. Our first
destination seems to be the church on the outskirts.  
In the end, we reached the church without encountering a single
villager.  
White walls and an orange roof. Part of it is tower-like, with a large
bell on top. It's no different from the churches I often saw before my
reincarnation.  
But one part is different...  
  
"Is that a flower crown?"  
"Yes. The symbol of this sect is a circle of flowers, just like that."  
  
It was painted on the tower; a wreath. What I usually saw is a cross, so
it feels a little strange. But, naturally, symbols would change if the
world is different.  
  
"I think it looks not much different from other religions."  
"Want to try going in?"  
"Yes, let's."  
  
After confirming with Samyu, I approached the church entrance. There’s a
decorated brown wooden door, with a flower-shaped door knocker. It's
made of metal. When Samyu used it, a clang-clang sound resonated. It's
certainly echoing inside as well.  
  
"Yes, how can I help you?"  
  
After a while, someone came out.  
The person was wearing a long, white robe with a green cloth draped over
their shoulder.  
A middle-aged man, giving off the impression of a clergyman.  
  
"May we have a look inside?"  
  
Samyu stated our purpose.  
Then, the man focused his gaze on Samyu—  
  
"Wh-what…! An elf…?!"  
"As you can see."  
"Ohh... What good fortune! Welcome to this humble village. It's a dream
come true. This is surely the Goddess's grace."  
  
The man dramatically expressed his surprise, clasped his hands, and
closed his eyes. He seems to be praying.  
Judging from his words, it seems to be more of an attitude towards the
Elf race as a whole rather than towards Samyu personally.  
Samyu didn’t react to the man's attitude and simply continued calmly as
usual.  
  
"So, is it possible to take a look around?"  
"Yes! Of course. Please, this way."  
  
Samyu's gaze caused the man to hastily move aside from the doorway.
Then, the inside of the church became clearly visible.  
  
"Wow... beautiful."  
"Indeed. This is a place of worship for the Goddess. We treasure
beautiful things."  
  
My involuntary exclamation of delight earned a nod from the man.  
True to his words, the church interior is incredibly beautiful. It's
about the size of a small auditorium. With pure white floors and walls,
the ceiling is higher than a normal house. Beautiful stained glass
windows were set high in the walls. The setting sun shone through the
stained glass on one side wall, casting slanted light. Various colors
were used in the stained glass, and the light was reflected beautifully
on the floor, creating vivid patterns.  
The benches, likely for prayer, were made of white stone, and they too
were hit with the filtered light through stained glass. Potted plants
were placed in various parts of the room, adding a touch of warmth to
the otherwise inorganic setting.  
  
"Lady Reni, let's go in."  
"Mhm."  
  
Prompted by Samyu, we proceeded down the central aisle.  
At the end was an altar, probably where prayers are offered. What was
displayed there was—  
  
"Mama?"  
  
A white statue. The statue, larger than me, has an incredibly beautiful
face.  
—Yes. It's my mother.  
  
"This is an image of the Goddess we worship."  
"She has pointy ears."  
"The Goddess has a similar appearance to modern-day elves. This is
because it is said that the elves were the first beings created by the
Goddess."  
  
I nodded thoughtfully at the man's words.  
I think my mother is as beautiful as a goddess, but maybe the Goddess
really does look like that. My mother is human now, so her ears are
round, but when she was the Elf Queen, her ears would have been pointy
like this statue.  
  
"Elves have inherited the Goddess's appearance and power. Unlike us
humans, their mana is strong and they have long lifespans, which we
consider proof. We revere the elves."  
"That's quite troublesome."  
  
Samyu bluntly cut off the man's wistful words.  
I’m sure that not only Samyu, but for all elves, being worshipped by
humans is not particularly pleasant.  
It wouldn’t be surprising if the man were to be shocked to hear the
object of his faith say that his devotion is a nuisance. But the man
nodded, saying, "I understand."  
  
"We understand that the feelings of beings like us are unnecessary to
the noble elves. Even now, being able to talk to you like this feels
like a dream."  
  
The man, his cheeks flushed, gazed at Samyu.  
He seemed genuinely happy. And Samyu's eyes were cold as she looked
back. ...Mhm.  
  
"More importantly, do you know that there have been a lot of cases of
children going missing recently?"  
  
Samyu went immediately to the heart of the issue. There shouldn't be any
rumors circulating in this village...  
  
"Yes. We know that such things are happening outside the village. It's a
very sad thing. Fortunately, this village has not been affected. Perhaps
this is also thanks to the Goddess's grace."  
  
After saying this, the man clasped his hands together as if offering a
prayer and closed his eyes.  
Samyu and I looked at him—  
  
*'This man knows about the incidents.'*  
*'Yes. It seems he’s well-informed, even though there were no rumors
circulating.'*  
*'He's suspicious.'*  
*'…Yes.'*  
  
I secretly conversed with Samyu using \[Telepathy\].  
If we believe the man, then it's all unrelated to this village, and
nothing has happened here. That's what it seems to be. But—  
  
*'There's a hidden room here.'*  
*'A hidden room?'*  
*'Mhm.'*  
  
While communicating through \[Telepathy\], I showed Samyu my right
hand.  
There—  
  
*'Is that a new item?'*  
*'It glows when there's something suspicious.'*  
  
A silver bracelet I've put on my right wrist. The gold magic stone in
its center is glowing faintly.  
This is the \[Exploration Bracelet\]. It shows an indication on the game
screen when there's a hidden room or item.  
I gave the \[Detection Bell\] to Carrie, so I equipped myself with a new
accessory.  
  
"Reaction detected."  
  
Perfect.  
There's something here.  
  
"Is this the only room in this church? Are there any other connecting
rooms?"  
"This is a small village church, so there's only this prayer hall."  
"...Is that so."  
  
The man smiled gently and replied.  
I can’t sense any ill intent from him, and he doesn't seem to be lying.
But—  
  
*'That's a lie.'*  
*'Yes.'*  
  
Before me, the strongest four-year-old, that lie is completely
transparent.  
My item is seeing through the man's lie!  
  
"By the way, what are your plans for today?"  
"The church was our objective, so we don't have any plans after this."  
"Is that so! It’s truly fortuitous that you came. If you haven't decided
on a place to stay, please stay in this village. I'll ask the
villagers!"  
  
The man looked at Samyu and his eyes lit up.  
Apparently, he wants us to stay in this village.  
  
*'Lady Reni, what should we do? We could defeat the man and search for
the hidden room...but...'*  
*‘Mhm. But since we're here...'*  
*'...Yes. He looks like he'll try something.'*  
  
Samyu and I nodded in agreement.  
We could make the first move, but if he does something, we could wait to
see what it is.  
So that’s why.  
  
"Father."  
"Then, I'll leave them to you."  
  
The man seems to have entrusted me and Samyu’s care to a family. The
villager family we met for the first time had stern faces and called the
man "Father."  
  
The man—Father—smiled gently after leaving us with them.
