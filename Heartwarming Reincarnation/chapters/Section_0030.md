# Chapter 30・Building an Underground Passage

So, I waited until night and then headed towards the town of Slanita
with Samyu.  
Equipped with the \[Hermit's Robe\], \[Cat's Paw Gloves\], \[Winged
Rabbit Boots\], and \[Detection Bell\], I was ready to deal with any
rough business.  
We arrived at the edge of town, in a space enclosed by trees along the
outer wall.  
  
"Is this alright?"  
"Yes, Lady Reni. Here, no one will see us, I think..."  
"Then, let's dig."  
"……Really, are you going to dig an underground passage from here to
Shultem's mansion?"  
"Mhm. I want to go to the cellar."  
  
That's right! I intend to dig underground to create a passage leading to
Shultem's mansion.  
  
"Shultem's mansion has a suspicious basement. Calculations indicate it's
a direct path from here, but wouldn't it take too long to build an
underground passage? Of course, I'll help, but…"  
"Leave it to Reni."  
  
I puffed out my chest and answered the worried-looking Samyu. Then, I
took out a \[Pickaxe (Exceptional)\]. Speaking of pickaxes, there's the
\[Pickaxe (Legendary)\] that I used to dig up a Jewel, but that one
breaks after a single use, making it not very practical. In comparison,
this one has a faster digging speed and higher durability—a very
user-friendly item, and the main pickaxe used in the game.  
It’s too big for a three-year-old. But, because I’m wearing the Cat's
Paw Gloves, I'm stronger than usual. I was able to lift it easily.  
I gripped the handle firmly and thrust it into the ground with a "Eiya!"
Then, a chunk of earth disappeared, creating a passage sloping
downwards.  
  
"……Amazing…"  
  
Witnessing that, Samyu uttered in astonishment.  
She continued to speak.  
  
"As expected of Lady Reni… amazing strength. Truly extraordinary… I had
resolved to believe in your power, but I'm ashamed of myself for
doubting you even for a moment."  
"Samyu, are you okay?"  
"I apologize. I was ashamed of myself. In any case, with this, we'll
have a path to the mansion quickly. I will take care of rearguard
vigilance and direction."  
"Mhm. Please."  
"Yes. Lady Reni, please dig a little further downwards."  
"Understood."  
  
Following Samyu's instructions, I thrust the pickaxe into the ground
again with a "Eiya!" And again, a chunk of earth disappeared.  
  
"Next, straight ahead, please."  
"Mhm."  
  
The underground passage created by digging diagonally downwards twice is
about 4 meters long. The diameter is just enough for an adult to walk
through without bending over. It’s not very large, but it should be
sufficient for Samyu and I to get through.  
Going through the underground passage, I thrust the pickaxe into the
earthen wall in front of me with a "Eiya!" Just like when I thrust it
into the ground, the earthen wall in front of me disappeared with a
pop.  
Following Samyu’s directions, I repeated the digging process over a
dozen times. The moment another chunk of earth disappeared, there was a
rattling sound. Then, instead of an earthen wall, a room appeared—  
  
"Arrived. Good."  
  
Samyu's precise measurement skills and my \[Pickaxe (Exceptional)\]'s
power were perfect. Entering the room that appeared, I checked front,
back, left, and right; there were several women inside. They were
probably women forcibly bought by Shultem.  
  
"What!?"  
"What happened!?"  
  
Everyone is looking at me in surprise. Mhm. That's right. You would be
surprised if a hole suddenly appeared in the wall. I hadn't considered
that.  
  
"Excuse me."  
  
It's nothing suspicious, so I quickly removed the \[Pickaxe
(Exceptional)\] and took off the hood of the \[Hermit's Robe\]. I also
greeted them politely. Since I'm wearing the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\], I
have cat ears, so they must see me as a cat beastgirl. My disguise is
perfect. It doesn’t matter if they see my appearance.  
  
"Eh?"  
"Ah… a child?"  
"What's wrong?"  
  
Seeing my young appearance, the women seemed relieved. But, their faces
immediately changed to anxious ones.  
  
"No, you shouldn't be here."  
"It's dangerous, you should go back."  
"Before you're found…"  
  
One woman approached me, trying to drive me away.  
Then, Samyu, who had been waiting behind me, swiftly stepped in front.  
  
"It's alright. We came to save you."  
"Save us?"  
"Yes. We have the documents and promissory notes Shultem used to buy
you. We will return them one by one, so please come and get them. The
underground passage continues to the outside of Slanita, so you can
return to your village or town."  
"That… but…"  
"Don't worry. Leave Shultem to us. Also, we've already told your
families about you. You can return home safely."  
  
Samyu's calm words. Yes. Samyu had identified the abducted people,
spoken to their families, and prepared a place for the women here to
return to.  
Even if we got the women bought by Shultem out of this mansion, it would
be meaningless if they didn't have a place to stay. As expected of
Samyu.  
  
"Really…to think that's possible…"  
"Then, I'll call your names—"  
  
The women still weren't sure if it was real. Samyu didn't mind; she
called each woman's name one by one. Then, she returned their documents
and IOUs.  
The women, upon actually receiving them, seemed to be able to believe
that what was happening to them was real, and their faces lit up
visibly.  
  
"I'll give you this too."  
  
I gave each woman a cloth bag big enough to hold with both hands.  
  
"What's this?"  
"Inside, there are potatoes, meat, and bread. Eat if you're hungry."  
"Is it alright?"  
"Mhm. It's delicious."  
  
Inside was a little bit of food and a few silver coins.  
Some people would have to travel by carriage from this town to reach
their homes. Samyu and I decided on the contents and amount that we
thought would be enough to get them home. I got the money by selling the
medicinal herbs I had at the tool shop.  
  
"Mama made the potatoes. Papa made the meat."  
  
My mother made dried sweet potatoes and my father made dried meat.
They're very delicious, so I recommend them. When I asked my father and
mother if I could have a little, they shared some with me.  
So, I handed them out, saying, "Please eat them," and they all accepted
them. Then, thanking me, they left the room through the underground
passage.  
Only Samyu and I were left.  
I put my hood back on before speaking to Samyu.  
  
"Samyu, is Shultem upstairs?"  
"Yes. This is where the women slept and basically lived. However, going
out of this room, there's a shower and toilet, and going up the stairs
leads to the master bedroom."  
"I see."  
  
Strange. A passage that leads directly from the master bedroom to the
basement… A basement that can only be accessed from the master bedroom.
The women who ran away were all truly beautiful.  
I clenched both hands. Then, I squeezed and loosened my fists several
times, and my paw pads squeaked.  
Then, a man's voice echoed—  
  
"Who should I choose today? That rebellious girl who just joined us
recently, perhaps!"  
  
Sticky, unnecessarily high-pitched, and above all, unrefined.  
There was a door in the room. I stared straight at it as it slid open
with a click.  
  
"It’s your turn today! —What!? Gone!?"  
  
The man who entered widened his eyes in surprise.  
A flabby body and a flabby spirit. Needs retraining.  
  
"Everyone went home."  
"……!? Where!? Where are you!?"  
"Anywhere you like, Town Mayor Shultem."  
"Wha—!? Who are you…!?"  
  
My figure wasn't visible, but Samyu's was.  
Upon seeing Samyu emerge from behind the furniture, the man was
surprised again. But, he quickly changed his expression to a lecherous
one.—This is Shultem.  
  
"……No, but, this is a beautiful elf… I must somehow make her mine…"  
  
That won't happen, will it?  
While Samyu distracted him, I quickly approached Shultem.  
And then a right straight to that flabby belly!  
  
"Cat punch!"  
  
It's underground, so there are no stars.  
  
"Become a fossil!"
