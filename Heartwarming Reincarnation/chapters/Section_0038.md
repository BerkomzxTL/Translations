# Chapter 38・I Arrived at Reoliga City

After parting ways with the girl, I walked with Samyu and finally
arrived in Reoliga City.  
Although there had been a commotion with a dragon, Reoliga seemed to be
completely unharmed and very peaceful.  
The girl probably arrived in the city safely as well.  
  
“…It’s big.”  
  
Reoliga City is surrounded by stone walls, and the gate to enter is
incredibly large.  
I unintentionally let out a gasp upon seeing the gate from a distance.  
  
“This is the most prosperous place around here. Many of the houses are
made of stone.”  
“Exciting!”  
  
Samyu’s words made my chest flutter with excitement.  
Leaving the village where I lived with my father and mother, I visited
towns and villages along the way, and that was also very fun.  
I’ve been reincarnated into a game world, and I’ve actually seen, heard,
smelled, and touched things… and eaten delicious food.  
I’m glad that I decided to go on this journey!  
  
“Lady Reni, to enter Reoliga City, you need to undergo an inspection at
the gate. I have a certificate from the Elf Kingdom, but…”  
  
Samyu said this and took a stone out of her bag.  
It’s a bluish-green stone about the size of her palm.  
  
“This is the certificate?”  
“Yes. It’s imbued with mana, and if there’s a magical tool to examine
it, my name, my parents’ names, and the seal of the current Elf Queen,
proving my identity, will be revealed.”  
“I see.”  
  
In the game, there wasn’t such an inspection to enter towns or cities.  
Thinking about the world before my reincarnation, it’s like a family
registration, isn’t it?  
  
“The issuing authority for certificates is usually the town, city, or
capital where you were born. Because elves have a small population and
are long-lived, the entire kingdom keeps track of them.”  
“I see.”  
“The larger the city or capital, the stricter the inspection. Some towns
tried to develop by foregoing inspections and allowing free entry, but
the security worsened, and I haven’t heard much good about them.”  
“What about Reoliga?”  
“It seems that gate inspections are carried out, so compared to the
villages and towns we’ve passed through, they’re taking precautions.”  
  
I nodded in agreement at what Samyu said.  
There’s a gate in the town of Slanita, but you essentially just have to
show your face to get in.  
I went shopping with my father and mother, but we were never stopped.  
None of the villages and towns along the way refused entry to Samyu and
me.  
  
“Given the scale of this city, I don’t think they’ll have magical tools,
as they’re expensive. Humans mostly use paper or plate certificates, so
visual confirmation would be the main method. I doubt they can read
elven certificates, but if I show my appearance and this stone, no one
will refuse me entry.”  
  
Having said that, Samyu’s expression clouded over.  
  
“However… Lady Reni doesn’t have a certificate, so if you undergo the
inspection, you won’t be allowed to enter.”  
“Reni, no certificate?”  
“Yes…. I’m sorry. When Lady Reni was born, your mother… the Queen,
decided not to create one... She thought it would be better for Lady
Reni’s protection…”  
  
I thought about the situation back then based on what Samyu said.  
My father was injured and bedridden. My mother was working tirelessly
and in debt.  
I was born, an unlikely child, between my mother, the Elf Queen, and my
human father.  
It was probably better not to create a certificate, both to hide me from
the world and to prevent debt collectors from forcibly taking me away.  
In fact, the debt collectors thought I was dead.  
  
“I guess we should get a proper certificate for Lady Reni as well…”  
  
Should I make one or not? How should I make one?  
I guess Samyu is thinking about it.  
  
“When will we use the certificate?”  
“Well… At the moment, I think we'll only be checked at the gate."  
“Then it’s okay.”  
  
I puffed out my chest confidently.  
  
“Reni has a hood.”  
  
That’s right! With the \[Hermit’s Robe\], the gate inspection is
meaningless.  
  
“I’ll walk close to Samyu and bypass the inspection.”  
  
I’ll use concealment to avoid being noticed and enter.  
I think Samyu intended to do that from the beginning.  
So, I nodded, indicating that it was fine, and Samyu let out a relieved
sigh.  
  
“If it becomes necessary in the future, I will obtain one for you
whatever it takes.”  
“…Mhm.”  
  
Samyu’s beautiful blue eyes gleamed.  
But I don’t think it will be necessary that often….  
  
“Then, let’s go.”  
“I’ll use the hood.”  
  
I tightly put on the hood of the \[Hermit’s Robe\].  
I walked hand-in-hand with Samyu for a while, and during the gate
inspection, I quietly waited in a place where I wouldn't bump into
anyone.  
Just as Samyu said, the inspection ended as soon as she showed the
stone.  
Since I’m concealed, no one noticed me.  
And then—  
  
“Amazing!”  
“Yes. It’s quite different from what we’ve seen before.”  
  
—Reoliga City is completely unlike anything I’ve seen before.  
  
Most of the houses made of grey stone are square, and some are four or
even five stories tall.  
Until now, the villages and towns we passed through were mostly made of
wood, many of which were two-story or single-story.  
The walls are grey instead of brown, and huge! The roads are properly
paved, and all the roads are beautifully paved with stone. The main
street is wide enough for carriages to pass each other, with space for
pedestrians to walk on either side.  
Colorful awnings were attached to the stone walls, adding splashes of
color to the grey landscape.  
  
“Samyu, it smells good!”  
“There seem to be food stalls. Would you like to eat something?”  
“Mhm!”  
  
—I want to eat meat!
