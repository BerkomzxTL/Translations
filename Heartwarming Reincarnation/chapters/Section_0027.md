# Chapter 27・It Seems To Be Sealed

Yesterday was quite a day.  
I followed some suspicious men, renovated Slanita Finance, and made
everyone there a star—all according to plan. I even got the hidden
ledger and other documents from the basement safe.  
But, the amount of information afterwards was unbelievable…  
  
\* I met Samyu, a cute and cool elf girl.  
\* My mother is actually the Elf Queen.  
\* I learned that my father is considered to have kidnapped her.  
\* Samyu and my father had obtained a \[Jewel\].  
\* My mother used it to change from an elf to human.  
  
“A jewel, huh…”  
  
I never imagined that the \[Jewel (Legendary)\] I obtained in the game
before my reincarnation would be used in this world to save my mother's
life and transform her from an elf to a human.  
Maybe it has something to do with my birth.  
I mean, they say elves and humans can't have children, yet here I am.  
So…  
  
“Status”  
  
There should be new information, so I’ll check it out!  
As expected, a new notation that hadn't been there before was added—  
  
\* Name: Reni Shurm Guora  
\* Race: Elf (Sealed)  
\* Age: 3  
\* Level: 999 (-97%)  
  
“Sealed…”  
  
Before, it just said Elf. Now it says (Sealed).  
In other words, my race is Elf, but because my power is sealed, I have a
human appearance.  
  
“Mama too…?”  
  
My mother wished for the \[Jewel\] to make her human.  
As a result, she’s living as a human now, but from what I’ve heard, the
difference between elves and humans is whether or not mana circulates
within their bodies.  
My mother couldn't control the mana in her body and was in danger.  
The \[Jewel\] likely removed or sealed her mana, making her
indistinguishable from a human.  
It didn’t change her race to human; she remains an elf, but with
human-level abilities.  
And I inherited that.  
  
“Mana manipulation…I might not be able to…"  
  
My race is Elf, but my inner mana is sealed.  
Considering that, it’s unlikely I can use magic.  
I saw the cool Samyu and I thought it would be nice if I could do it
too, but it seems I have to break the seal first...  
  
“Should I look for the jewel?”  
  
They said there are seven Jewels in this world.  
Maybe I should look for them and try to unseal my powers.  
My mother regaining her elf powers would likely lead to her death, and
since she’s living with my father, that’s not an option.  
But I should be able return to being an elf.  
And―  
  
“I want to see it.”  
  
What color is the actual \[Jewel\]?  
How big is it?  
How bright is it?  
  
Just thinking about it makes my heart race.  
The \[Jewels\] I was planning to search for before in my previous life.
There are seven of them in this world.  
It’s not that I want to get them; unsealing my powers isn’t the top
priority either.  
  
—My heart says, 'I want to see them.'  
  
“Okay!”  
  
I stood up from the bed where I was lying down.  
I was up late last night, so I completely overslept.  
I'm three years old, after all. After hearing my parents' story and
saying I wanted to travel, I must have gotten really sleepy from the
relief.  
So, I think Samyu told them about what I did in Slanita.  
I quickly changed clothes and went downstairs, where my mother was
working in the kitchen.  
  
"Mama."  
"Oh, Reni, you’re awake. Good morning."  
"Good morning."  
"You were up late yesterday, so I thought you might still be sleepy."  
"No, I'm fine. But I'm hungry."  
  
My stomach was rumbling because I slept through breakfast.  
My mother laughed and quickly prepared some soup.  
As I sat down and ate with a wooden spoon, my mother sat down in front
of me.  
Usually, she’s busy working or anxiously looking out the window.  
My mother's behavior is unusual, so I looked up and saw her smiling.  
  
"Mama, aren't you busy?"  
"Well, thanks to a cute and strong girl, not only do I no longer have to
work so hard, but it seems like the danger has also disappeared."  
  
Her eyes are so kind…  
Although she was once the Queen of the Elves, my mother has had nothing
but a hard time living as a human.  
I’m so glad things are getting easier for her, even if only a little.  
I was so happy that I couldn’t help but smile while eating my soup.  
Then, my mother stroked my head.  
  
“Yesterday, Samyu kept saying that Reni has incredible power. So, Papa,
Mama, and Samyu talked, but could you give Papa and Mama a little
time?”  
"Time?"  
"Yes. Reni wants to travel soon, but we'd like you to live with us until
you're four."  
  
I think there's about six months left until my fourth birthday.  
I’ll think about what I’ve done so far and what I can do in the next six
months.  
  
I healed my father's body and made the field prosperous.  
I defeated the debt collectors who broke into our house and got back the
IOUs.  
And then, I destroyed Slanita Finance, which was still targeting my
mother.  
  
And then…  
  
"Okay. I'll stay until I'm four."  
“…Good.”  
  
When I nodded, my mother smiled happily.  
  
"Mama and Papa have so much they want to do with Reni. We'll have
picnics with packed lunches and go shopping in town. Things we haven't
been able to do before."  
"That sounds fun."  
"We'll make lots of memories with Reni."  
"Mhm."  
  
My father and mother were doing their best to survive and hide me.  
Hearing about my decision to travel and my abilities from Samyu must
have given them peace of mind.  
I also want to make memories with my father and mother in places other
than just inside our home.  
  
"Mama, where's Samyu?"  
"Samyu said she was going into the forest."  
"Forest."  
"If Reni calls her, she’ll probably come right away."  
  
Mother laughed softly  
I looked at her smile and took another spoonful of soup.  
  
"Reni loves mama's smile."  
  
Looking at it makes me feel very happy.  
Therefore—  
  
"I want to talk to Samyu."  
  
To protect my father and mother.  
I still have something left to do.  
  
—Mayor Shultem.  
  
The person believed to be behind Slanita Finance.  
Samyu said she would investigate.  
  
—Let's settle this before I go on my journey!
