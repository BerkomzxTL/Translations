# Chapter 80・Let's talk

After hearing the story from \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\], I got a
clearer picture of what to do next.  
  
\* Recast the spell to narrow the \[Mana Pathways\].  
\* Train in \[Mana Manipulation\].  
\* Search for \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]'s treasure.  
  
By doing these three things, I can suppress my current \[Mana Rampage\].
That means I won't disappear, and the world's destruction (game over)
will be avoided.  
After finishing her story, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] said, "I'm going
to take a look around the world for a bit," and flew out the window.  
Only Samyu and I were left in the room.  
Samyu picked up the comforter and urged me to sleep.  
  
"Lady Reni, I’m sure you're tired. Queen Hasano has started preparing
the spell to narrow the \[Mana Pathways\]. Please rest until it's ready.
She said it would be sometime tomorrow morning or afternoon."  
"Okay."  
  
My body does feel hot and heavy.  
But…  
  
"Samyu. Over here."  
  
I got up from the bed and walked to the sofa.  
I patted the seat of the sofa.  
A gesture of 'come here'.  
  
"Sit here. I want to talk."  
"B-but, Lady Reni…"  
  
Samyu looked back and forth between the bed and me.  
She frowned, looking troubled, and remained where she was.  
  
"Lady Reni. I think you need to rest right now. There will be other
opportunities to talk later."  
"Mhm."  
"I think you should prioritize your health over talking to me…"  
"Mhm."  
  
Samyu is right. It doesn't have to be now.  
But…still, I―  
  
"Reni, Samyu, worried."  
"Eh…?"  
"Samyu, not well. Worried, can't rest."  
"Lady… Reni…"  
  
I know I shouldn't push myself to avoid the world's destruction.  
But I'm worried about Samyu.  
  
"Samyu, are you anxious? Troubled?"  
  
Before I was reincarnated, I was a hikikomori high school girl.  
The kind of person who couldn’t fit in well with others and couldn't
even go to school normally.  
A normal person… how would they have a conversation like this? Could
that past me handle it better…?  
Casually asking the reason, inviting them to a nice meal…? But I’m not
that tactful.  
If I were to say something, it’d seem unusual and make me stand out. If
I stayed silent to avoid that, it irritated the people around me.  
No matter which I chose, I couldn’t do anything well. I couldn’t say
anything other than "I'm sorry"...  
  
"…Reni is, failing."  
  
Before my reincarnation, what did I accomplish? I died without being
able to do anything.  
And then, I was reincarnated into this world and gained a lot of
powerful abilities.  
  
"Reni, strong but… can't do a lot of things."  
  
I decided to save my father and mother and see the world. Because I
thought I had power.  
And yet, I still mess up sometimes…  
  
"Thanks to Papa and Mama, I realized it’s okay."  
  
My father and mother accepted me with a smile. They hugged me tightly,
even when I failed, not just when I succeeded.  
That's why… Now I can say many words other than "I'm sorry," and I can
convey what I want to do.  
And the reason I can laugh here now is―  
  
"Samyu, helped me a lot."  
  
―because Samyu was there.  
She believed in me completely. She looked at me, the me who can do it.
Whenever I look up at her, she always smiles happily.  
…And that makes me really happy.  
Her smile always makes my heart flutter.  
But now, Samyu's beloved smile. Her sparkling blue eyes. They’re
clouded…  
  
"…Maybe Reni… did something."  
  
…Maybe it's my fault.  
Just now, I finally thought of one possibility.  
Samyu isn’t feeling well… Maybe I've worn out her patience.  
I was a hikikomori who stood out from others before my reincarnation. My
communication skills didn't improve just because I was reincarnated.  
So… maybe something I did made Samyu lose her energy.  
Thinking about that, my chest ached, and I looked down involuntarily.  
Then—  
  
"That’s not true! Lady Reni…!"  
  
A panicked voice and the sound of footsteps approaching.  
I found myself being embraced by something warm.  
  
"Sam…yu?"  
"I'm sorry, Lady Reni! I, I didn't mean to make you sad…!"  
  
Samyu knelt in front of the sofa and hugged me tightly.  
  
"I… when I was told you might disappear, I thought I absolutely didn’t
want that to happen. I was scared. …And I thought, if only Lady Reni
would just stay in the Elven Forest. Such a shameless thought crossed my
mind…"  
  
Samyu's voice is trembling.  
I’m sure she’s making a very painful confession right now…  
  
"When the Queen… Lady Reni’s mother… eloped with a human man, I…
realized my love for her was wrong. Binding someone out of love,
imposing my hopes, ignoring their will—it's wrong. …That's why we elves
lost Lady Reni’s mother, I thought…"  
"…Mhm."  
"The human man… your father… loved the Queen as she was. …I envied that,
resented it… I was jealous. I thought that was the right way to love
someone…"  
  
Samyu's story was about my father and mother.  
The elves here tried to quietly accept death with my mother, while my
father didn't give up on living with her.  
As a result, my mother became human and left this place, but the regrets
have been lingering in Samyu's heart ever since.  
  
"I was wrong. That's why… I felt deep despair when my dream of becoming
the guardian of the Queen's child vanished."  
  
The Elven Forest after my mother disappeared. Samyu, who had worked hard
to be the guardian of my mother’s child, had resolved herself to it.
That dream disappeared, and she must have suffered greatly.  
  
"But my dream continued… I've always been thinking about how I could
support Lady Reni, so I wouldn't make the same mistake again. I was
determined not to love you in a way that tied you down, forced you, or
ignored your will."  
  
From the time we met… Samyu never stopped me. She explained things to me
and supported me in doing whatever I wanted.  
That was… because of her past suffering and sadness.  
It wasn't like that from the beginning. Samyu must have been thinking
hard about it.  
  
"But… I'm still a useless elf. Right now, all I can think about is how
to get Lady Reni to stay here. Even when \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]
suggested you look for her treasure, I couldn't be happy about it… Even
though Lady Reni wants to do it."  
  
She didn't make eye contact earlier because she was struggling with
conflicting feelings of wanting to stop me and knowing she shouldn't.  
After saying that, Samyu slightly distanced herself from me.  
I could only see a little of her profile. Samyu had her eyes closed…  
  
"When I saw the human female knight, I felt like I was seeing my former
self and despised her."  
"Pio?"  
"Yes… Saying she wants to protect someone, while locking them up in a
small world. Saying she'll remove danger, while cutting off all
friendships… That's not the right way to love someone. I arrogantly
thought I would never do that again."  
  
Samyu and Pio. They didn't get along.  
I thought it was because of Pio's cold attitude at their first meeting,
but it seems there was more to it.  
Samyu must have seen her past self reflected in Pio, and lashed out as a
result.  
  
"But I… I’m the same as that human female knight. Pathetic and weak.
That's who I am."  
  
After saying that, Samyu hugged me tightly again, hiding her face.  
  
"Lady Reni will surely go on a journey to avoid the world's destruction.
And you will certainly succeed. That's why… I can't stop you… Because
Lady Reni is the kind of person who runs for the sake of others…"  
  
Samyu let out a long, deep sigh.  
I can't see her expression, but from her trembling body and breath, I
know she's sad.  
But I… I…  
  
"Samyu."  
  
I hugged Samyu tightly in return.  
  
"Reni… is happy."  
  
What should I do…? I'm happy.  
Samyu's confession is heavy, she's struggling with how to love me. She's
mourning and sad that I might disappear, yet I feel this way.  
It's strange. But…  
  
"Reni will use her strength for the world."  
  
It never even crossed Samyu's mind that I would cower and hide away in
the Elven Forest.  
She didn’t give it a second thought.  
  
"Reni will do it."  
  
—She believes in me.  
Because she believes, she's struggling because she can't stop me.  
"Reni doesn't know about love."  
  
Was Samyu wrong, and my father right?  
But I don't think that's the case.  
There are many different ways to love, and many different relationships.
My father and mother happened to get along well, and Samyu had a sad
experience.  
That's in the past. I don’t know what the future holds, and there's no
guarantee it will last forever. I'm sure my parents will change the
shape of their love again, and Carrie and Pio are also struggling and
trying their best.  
And now, Samyu and I are together. I want to be with Samyu.  
  
"Reni loves Samyu."  
“Lady… Reni…"  
"Reni loves Samyu."  
  
Even though she's a very cute and beautiful girl, she has trouble
breathing…  
She's very strong, but sometimes she loses confidence.  
That's what I like about Samyu.  
  
"Samyu, believe more."  
"Believe more…?"  
"Mhm. In Reni, more, more."  
  
She always believes in me. That makes me so happy…  
  
"If it's Reni, I'll definitely win."  
"Win…?"  
"Mhm."  
  
I can do more.  
Believe in me.  
  
"Won't let the world be destroyed."  
"…Yes."  
"Reni won't disappear."  
"Y-yes!"  
"Will explore the world with Samyu."  
"Yes!!!…"  
  
After saying that, Samyu cried out loudly, "Waaah!".  
I just hugged her tightly until she calmed down.  
After a while, Samyu gently pulled away from me.  
Her blue eyes were sparkling…  
  
"Even if the jewel is gone and the world is about to be destroyed, I'm
sure Lady Reni will do something amazing!"  
"Mhm."  
"Even if Lady Reni disappears from this world, I'll go get you!"  
"Go get me?"  
"Yes! Even if I have to cross the world! I'll definitely find Lady Reni!
And we'll travel together forever!"  
  
Samyu clenched her right fist tightly and declared loudly.  
She looked so serious… so I couldn't help but laugh.  
  
"Mhm, that's good."  
"Yes! There’s no problem!!"  
"Mhm. It's the best."  
"Yes! It's the best!!"  
  
Ah. As expected, my heart flutters when Samyu is happy.  
  
"Will work hard on training."  
"Yes!! I will also work harder to become a better elf!"  
  
We nodded at each other.  
Yes. If it's the two of us, things will definitely be okay!  
  
—Now then! Let's become even stronger!
