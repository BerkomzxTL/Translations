# Chapter 40・She’s a Princess

"Princess…"  
  
The girl I rescued from the dragon. Fluffy brown hair, a very pretty
dress. And she was called "Your Highness."  
I had a feeling she was of high standing, but it turns out she's a
princess.  
  
"I have heard that this kingdom has a king, queen, and three children.
She's likely the youngest princess."  
  
I nodded in agreement with Samyu's explanation.  
She spoke more maturely than she looked, and if you told me she was a
young princess, I'd believe it. But I also had a question.  
  
"Would a princess really come all this way alone?"  
  
Assuming that girl is a princess, would a princess around my age have
any reason to come to Reoliga City by herself?  
Samyu nodded at my question, saying, "That's right."  
  
"The royal capital is south of here, and it's not close. I can't imagine
anything important enough in this area for a princess to visit in
person…"  
"She was attacked by a dragon. Maybe there’s a connection."  
  
A young princess traveling alone far from the capital, being chased by a
dragon. I don't know anything yet, but I have a feeling something's up.
If it were just a trip, that would be fine, but…  
  
"Samyu, sit here and let's read the letter together."  
  
For now, I want to know what's in this letter.  
So, I patted the space next to me on the sofa, inviting Samyu, who was
kneeling on the floor, to sit.  
But she seemed hesitant…  
  
"But…"  
  
She looked troubled.  
She's probably hesitant to sit next to me.  
Samyu treats me very carefully, but I’m sure it’s tiring to stay in that
position. I really want her to sit on the sofa.  
So I looked Samyu in the eye, tilted my head slightly, and spoke.  
  
"Reni wants Samyu to come over here."  
"Y-yes, with pleasure!!"  
  
Samyu, who had been kneeling, made an izakaya-like noise and quickly
settled next to me.  
Good, good. Samyu's cheeks are red, but I think it’ll be alright.  
I opened the envelope I was holding and handed the paper to Samyu.  
She then read it slowly, making sure it was easy for me to follow.  
The handwriting on the letter is very beautiful. Unlike mine, it feels
refined and cultured.  
After a proper greeting, the main subject was written. It was—  
  
"It's a tea party invitation."  
  
A promise with the princess.  
After arriving in Reoliga City, the princess apparently wanted to hold a
tea party immediately and wrote this letter.  
  
"I feel that a great deal of care has been taken with the contents. It
follows the etiquette of someone connected to the royal family of this
kingdom."  
"A formal invitation?"  
"Yes. Normally, a member of the royal family wouldn't show this much
respect to a random passerby… She must be very grateful for being saved
by Lady Reni."  
"Mhm."  
"It says the mayor of Reoliga and the lord will also be attending."  
"Is that amazing?"  
"Yes… The mayor is understandable, but the lord too…"  
  
Samyu has been making a troubled face for a while now.  
  
"The lord is a hereditary high-ranking noble. The royal family entrusts
them with domains. Count Gaillard is the name of the lord who governs
this area."  
"So, Count Gaillard will be at the tea party."  
"Yes. I think it's connected to the Princess, but..."  
  
Samyu was being vague with her words, so I pondered, hmm.  
She doesn't seem to have a good feeling about this tea party.  
  
"Samyu, are you against the tea party?"  
"It's not that I'm against it, but…"  
"Is their social standing too high for us?"  
  
Judging from Samyu's tone and expression, it might be better not to
go.  
I thought it was just a tea party, but I don't know etiquette, and I
don't think I can be with a princess.  
When I asked that, Samyu shook her head.  
Then, she looked at me with a serious expression.  
  
"Lady Reni. Even though you're currently hiding your identity and have
no status, if you were to return to the Elf Kingdom, you would be able
to live as a princess yourself. You yourself are a noble."  
"Ah… mmn."  
  
Come to think of it, that's right. My mother is the queen, so I'm a
princess. That’s true.  
  
"Therefore, I don't think there's a problem with having tea with a human
princess. I don't think Lady Reni should be concerned about the other
person's status, so there's no need to worry about their social
standing. The other party shouldn’t know about elven matters, so the
fact that they've shown such respect to Lady Reni is admirable.
However…"  
  
Samyu bit her lip tightly once.  
  
"I'm worried that getting too close would become a shackle."  
"A shackle?"  
"Yes. If you keep power in one place, and if you want to rise in status,
it can be useful. However, I feel that Lady Reni already has enough
power. If the human authorities find out, it could become
troublesome…"  
"I won't be able to travel anymore?"  
  
That would be a problem.  
I frowned, and Samyu closed her mouth.  
After a short pause, she slowly began to speak again—  
  
"…Lady Reni, I apologize. I've lived as an elf for a long time. So, I
think it's partly due to me not having very good feelings toward humans.
There's nothing wrong with Lady Reni interacting with the human world
and gaining status. And if Lady Reni deems it necessary, it will be
useful for traveling."  
  
Samyu looked at me straight in the eyes after saying that.  
  
"As Lady Reni wishes."  
  
Samyu's eyes are always a beautiful blue.  
There's no lie or hesitation in them, and she’ll truly respect whatever
decision I make.  
Samyu gave me plenty of information. On top of that, she's also told me
that her decision was influenced by her elf status.  
This is what I like about Samyu.  
Thanks to Samyu, I can think and decide for myself.  
So I—  
  
"Reni made a promise, so Reni will go to the tea party."  
  
The princess looked happy about the tea party promise. I don't want to
cloud her smile.  
  
"But Reni doesn't want to be with important people."  
  
I just want to keep the promise we made, the two of us.  
I'm not interested in the princess's status, or the power of the lord or
mayor.  
To achieve my goal of traveling and seeing the world with my own eyes, I
don't need power at all right now.  
  
"―So, Reni will go as a cat."  
  
The princess only knows me as a cat beastgirl. I'll just wear my \[Cat's
Paw Gloves\].  
  
"If anything happens, Reni will run away immediately. It's perfect
because it's a cat disguise."  
  
If the "troublesome things" Samyu mentioned happen, let’s run away
immediately!  
So, I smiled, saying it would be okay, and Samyu softly narrowed her
eyes.  
  
"Yes. I will accompany you."  
"Mhm! Then, let's write a reply."  
  
—Let's go to a tea party!
