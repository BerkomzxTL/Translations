# Chapter 6・This Is My Scoop

"Shkoop, shkoop..."  
  
Muttering to myself, I ran here and there, my eyes searching for an
item.  
Something I could scoop up soil with, something a toddler could hold,
and something that wouldn't look too out of place if it was lying around
here.  
It was quite a difficult set of conditions, but my maxed-out item box
had just the thing—  
  
"Reni!"  
  
My mother, having spotted me after I'd circled the house, beckoned me
over.  
I approached her, holding the item I'd retrieved from my item box.  
She looked relieved to see me return so quickly, then tilted her head,
noticing what I was holding.  
  
"A ladle?"  
"Ya."  
"Where did you...?"  
"It fell down."  
  
My mother furrowed her brow suspiciously at my answer.  
  
"Around the house?"  
"Ya."  
"A ladle?"  
"Ya."  
" ...Why was there a ladle in our yard...? And it looks really
nice..."  
  
My mother pondered, tilting her head.  
I silently applauded her in my heart. Her comment about it "looking
really nice" is completely accurate.  
  
This ladle is actually a weapon, classified as a dagger.  
It was incredibly valuable, requiring several SS-grade materials and a
large quantity of S-grade materials in order to craft it.  
Her ability to recognize that shows she has quite discerning taste.  
Incidentally, despite being so valuable, this ladle is incredibly weak
as a weapon. Its only advantage is that its attack power doesn’t
decrease even if you don’t sharpen it.  
So why does such a weapon exist?  
In the game, it was mainly seen as a fashion item for cosplay.  
Similarly, I think many people wore the chef’s hat and coat, which have
low defense power despite the difficulty of their creation, and gathered
with their close friends to have fun role-playing together.  
There's no way a ladle like this would just be lying around our house.  
My mother's suspicion is natural, but she didn't have time to dwell on
it—  
  
\* If the owner appears, return it properly.  
\* Use it carefully.  
\* You can touch the soil in the garden, but don't mess with the
vegetables.  
  
She told me these things and then quickly got to work in the field.  
Don't worry, leave it to me!  
I'll use this \[Fertilizer (Legendary)\]-enriched soil and this ladle to
spread it carefully!  
And so, I squatted down, scooping up the fluffy soil with the ladle. I
carefully carried it without spilling, and approached the rows of sweet
potato. Then, avoiding the potato leaves and vines, I succeeded in
firmly covering the roots with soil...!  
  
"Fuwaa..."  
  
I did it...!  
I think this is the first time something’s gone well on the first
attempt...!  
The ladle is harder to use than a shovel, but it fulfilled its purpose
exactly as I’d imagined it would. Now, all I have to do is repeat this
for the whole field...!  
...The whole field? No way...  
  
"So far away..."  
  
The future is so far away…  
I was happy with the first one, but no matter how I think about it, I
think I have to do this at least two hundred more times. No, maybe even
more than that…  
...But I have no choice but to do it.  
That's right. This kind of thing happens all the time in games. Leveling
up involves repeating simple tasks until, before you know it, you’ve
gotten stronger. It's not like one big success is the end of it all.
It’s about repeating little successes. That's what matters.  
  
"Okay!"  
  
I re-grasped the ladle again and heaved myself to my feet. My mother
seems to be continuing her fieldwork, so I'll continue this work too!  
And I want to check on something that's been on my mind.  
  
—This lack of money.  
  
If I steadily work on the garden, I think we'll soon have a bountiful
harvest, and my parents will be relieved... or so I thought. But is that
really the case? Will everything be solved if father's body recovers and
we can earn a living from the field?  
Right now, my parents work from morning till late at night, and yet we
have so little money... something's wrong. I feel like something is
going on.  
  
—From now on, it's an investigative mission.
