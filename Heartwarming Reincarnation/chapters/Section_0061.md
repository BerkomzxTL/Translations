# Chapter 61・Reni Is a Genius 3 (1)

Carrie, who had been placed in a carriage, arrived at the capital.  
The carriage was pulled by \[Death Horses\], capable of running
continuously through the night. Their speed and stamina were
extraordinary, making the journey incredibly fast.  
Carrie had considered escaping on the way, but it proved impossible.  
She was taken to the basement of the lord's castle. Beneath the large
white castle lay a vast facility.  
  
"This is…"  
"You wouldn't have thought there was such a facility beneath my castle,
would you? This is the headquarters of the \[Tears of the Goddess\]
sect."  
"\[Tears of the Goddess\]… That's the cult that made the prophecy about
a child with the powers of a god, isn't it?"  
"That’s right. I am the supreme leader of that sect, the Bishop."  
"……Gaillard is the Bishop?"  
  
Carrie was speechless at Gaillard's words.  
Gaillard, whom she trusted. To think he was the Bishop of a sect that
made the prophecy...  
  
"Where are we going?"  
"To the center of the underground facility. The chapel."  
  
Walking down the corridor, she asked Gaillard their destination.  
  
"What are all these doors?"  
"There are three children in each room. They're getting along well."  
"All these doors… imprisoning children…"  
"We're not imprisoning them. We're protecting children with talent."  
  
There were at least twenty doors. That meant sixty children.  
Carrie clenched her fists at the scale of it.  
So many children had been abducted…  
She racked her brain for a way to save them.  
Rebelling here and now would be pointless. Letting someone know was the
best option.  
She slipped her left hand into her pocket.  
She touched two stones, a \[Flash Stone\] and a \[Fireworks Stone\].
Gifts from Reni; if only she could contact the outside somehow…  
  
"We've arrived."  
  
As Gaillard said, they arrived at the chapel.  
He'd called it the center of the facility, and it was the only area with
a high ceiling.  
Despite being underground, light streamed in through stained-glass
windows, creating a mystical atmosphere.  
At the far end of the room was an altar with a statue of a goddess.
Behind the altar were three passageways leading further into the
depths.  
And on her left was a spiral staircase leading to the upper part of the
chapel's high ceiling, seemingly a narrow passageway for cleaning the
stained-glass windows.  
Carrie gazed at the stained glass.  
Since light was coming through, that part of the stained glass must
connect to the surface. Gaillard, noticing her, chuckled.  
  
"What do you think, Your Highness? Beautiful stained glass, isn't it?"  
"……Yes, it is."  
"I had it made. It depicts the former royal capital, Riwander."  
"Riwander…? The city overflowing with undead?"  
"That’s right. Now it's called the Wandering Capital, but it was
supposedly a very beautiful city."  
  
Carrie frowned, suspicious of this sudden turn in the conversation.  
Gaillard continued calmly.  
  
"I am a descendant of the royal family who lived in the capital of
Riwander."  
"Gaillard is?"  
"Yes. In Riwander's past, there was a large-scale magical ritual,
resulting in the deaths of both the royal family and the people. My
ancestor happened to be outside the range and survived."  
  
\[The Wandering Capital, Riwander\]. A city destroyed by a king who
sought immortality.  
Gaillard was his descendant.  
  
"Having lost their home and kingdom, my ancestors came to this kingdom
and survived. I am former royalty. Using my abilities, I rose to the
rank of Count."  
Gaillard looked at Carrie.  
  
"I want you to marry me, Your Highness."  
"Me and Gaillard? Why?"  
"Because the power of the goddess will be inherited. If you bear a
child, it will pass to that child, and then to the next. It is a
wonderful thing for the royal family to possess the power of the
goddess."  
"……Why does Gaillard know such things?"  
  
Carrie was perplexed by how Gaillard spoke as if he knew everything.  
Why did he have such blind faith in the prophecy of the \[Tears of the
Goddess\] cult? And why did he speak of the transfer of the goddess's
power as if it were common knowledge, something she'd never even heard
of?  
Gaillard smiled calmly at her question.  
  
"Because we royals possess the power of the Jewel."  
  
The reason Gaillard was so knowledgeable about the goddess's power.  
It was because he possessed a \[Jewel (Legendary)\].  
  
"The magical activity in Riwander. A Jewel was used. The Jewel was fixed
into a magic circle and activated by the king seeking immortality…
However, it failed, the knights became Living Mail, and the people
became ghouls."  
  
There was no lie in his eloquent words.  
  
"I secretly visited Riwander many times, and I discovered that I could
manipulate the monsters wandering there. This was the power given to us,
the royal family. The Jewel granted not only immortality but also the
ability to manipulate the people. However, the ruler who should have
controlled them was caught up in the magic circle, and the monsters lost
their will. That was Riwander up until now."  
  
Gaillard looked up at the stained-glass window dreamily.  
  
"I read the literature of Riwander. Before it was overrun with monsters,
it seems it was a city with advanced modernization, replete with clean
water and sewage systems; a white palace surrounded by rows of houses
made of blue stone."  
  
The stained-glass window was made based on the literature.  
The city depicted there was very beautiful.  
  
"I just want to reclaim my kingdom."  
  
Gaillard looked intently at Carrie.  
  
"To purify Riwander, to return the dead to the earth. And to call upon
new people and establish a kingdom. As the Bishop of the \[Tears of the
Goddess\], I have already gathered believers. I intend to relocate them.
And the children I've gathered, the children of God, are all brimming
with talent. I will take them too."  
  
He smiled calmly.  
  
"A city populated with talented people I've gathered for my sake.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?"  
  
Carrie gasped at Gaillard's words.  
  
"……The people are not tools for the royal family's games."  
  
She gripped the stones in her left pocket.  
The slightly rough one was the \[Flash Stone\].  
  
"Everyone has their own will, lives their own life, and decides their
own place!!"  
  
She threw it at Gaillard without hesitation.  
  
"Ugh!!"  
  
In the brightly lit world, Carrie kicked off the ground, slipping
through the light.  
She aimed for the spiral staircase.  
She ran up quickly, towards the stained glass.  
Then she threw a vase that was decorating the area with all her might.  
With a tremendous crash, both the stained-glass window and the vase
shattered. Then, she threw the \[Fireworks Stone\] out through the gap
in the stained-glass window.  
This would be a signal to Reni.  
  
"The royal family respects that, and continues to strive so that they
may live better lives. It is not that the people exist because the royal
family exists; it is because the people acknowledge us that we are in
this position!"  
  
That's what her father and mother, who were royals, had taught her.  
And she'd seen her older brother and sister follow those teachings and
strive.  
Standing before the shattered stained-glass window, she looked down at
Gaillard and shouted,  
  
"The people do not exist for the king! The king exists for the
people!"
