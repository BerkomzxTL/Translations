# Chapter 15・They’re Bad at Giving Up

I checked my equipment, left a note, and hoisted myself from the bed to
the windowsill.  
Pushing open one side of the double-hung window produced a scraping
sound of wood before swinging outward.  
My bedroom is on the second floor, so it's quite high when you look
down, but with my \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], I’ll be fine.  
Without any particular fear, I hopped off the windowsill and jumped
down.  
  
“Jump!”  
  
A momentary feeling of floating.  
My body, which should have immediately fallen according to gravity,
descended softly and slowly thanks to the effect of \[Flight (Jump)\].  
  
“Safe.”  
  
After making sure that the hood of my \[Hermit's Robe\] hadn't come off,
I started walking.  
The second-floor window was left slightly ajar, but it can’t be
helped.  
My parents seem to have a habit of talking late at night, so they
shouldn’t notice my absence for a while. Even if they do notice, there's
the note I left behind, so it's no problem.  
The \[Detection Bell\] is still ringing, so there should be an enemy
nearby, but―  
  
“…There.”  
  
Using the starlight, I circled the house and found several men lurking
around.  
All of them were dressed in black, with black cloth covering their
mouths.  
Yes. Extremely ominous attire. Overwhelmingly suspicious.  
  
"Hey… what's going on?"  
"I don't understand… a house should be here in this part of the
village…?"  
"What's happening…"  
  
The suspicious people looked confused. There are six of them in total.  
About twice the number that came before, but they seem unable to find my
house.  
After observing them for a while, I realized that my \[Evasion Talisman
(Special)\] might be performing mental interference.  
  
\* The suspicious men approach my house.  
\* However, they stop abruptly near where I buried the talisman.  
\* For some reason, they turn their attention elsewhere.  
  
They’ve been repeating this for a while now.  
They’re desperately searching, but their appearance… is pathetic. My
house is right in front of them, yet six grown men can't find a single
clue.  
As expected from the \[Evasion Talisman (Special)\], it’s doing a great
job.  
I couldn’t help but chuckle, and one of the suspicious men reacted to my
laughter and looked around sharply.  
  
"W-what?! Hey, was someone there just now?"  
"No… uh… what?"  
"I can't see anyone but us…"  
  
The house they're searching for is right in front of them. And I, who
let out a laugh, am standing right behind them.  
Yet, nothing is reflected in their eyes—  
  
"Damn it, there's nothing we can do here. Let's go back."  
  
The largest among the suspicious men gestured with his hand, gathering
everyone. Is he the leader? He's different from the one who came to my
house before.  
The leader-like man gave instructions to the other five, and it seems
they're retreating for now.  
Well, it’d be a problem if the villagers saw them wandering around
dressed like that and called the guards.  
  
“…Man,… I’m getting a little scared…”  
  
One of the six people gathered muttered softly.  
This prompted the others to start whispering to each other as well.  
  
"This is strange…"  
"Yeah… how is this possible?"  
"I…I heard a laugh…"  
  
The suspicious men seemed to have been suppressing their fear, but it
leaked out after one of them mumbled.  
From my perspective, their appearance is laughable, but for them, they
must feel like they've just encountered a paranormal phenomenon.  
With only starlight and their mouths hidden by black cloth, I couldn't
see their expressions clearly, but they all seemed pale.  
  
“…Should we just give up?”  
"That's right…it's just one woman."  
"We've already earned enough, let's just call it quits…"  
"...Maybe it's best not to get involved?"  
"Man, no more―"  
  
Five of the suspicious men pleaded with the leader.  
But the leader-like man lowered his voice and told the five, “…Shut
up.”  
  
"It's not just our problem. If we want to keep working in the town, we
have no choice but to do this, we can't back out now."  
  
The strong tone and forcefulness silenced the other five.  
Seeing them like that, the leader-like man spoke in a brighter voice
than before.  
  
"And if this succeeds, our relationship with the higher-ups will become
stronger. We won't have to worry about money for the rest of our
lives."  
  
The leader's mouth is hidden by cloth. I can’t see it, but I can sense a
smirk from his atmosphere.  
For the five who had fallen silent, those words seemed attractive, and
they exchanged glances.  
Then, they nodded in agreement and said, "That's right."  
  
"We can come back during the day."  
"Yeah. I don't understand why this is happening, but I’m sure it'll work
out somehow."  
"Even if we can't find the house, the woman will eventually go out.
She's definitely in this village, so all we have to do is catch her."  
"We've seen the man many times. If we catch the man, the woman will have
no choice but to come out."  
"Even if he's strong, if we take the people of this village hostage, we
should be able to catch him."  
  
The suspicious men, who had been afraid of my house, began to put
together their nasty thoughts one after another.  
  
"Let's discuss this back at the hideout. Let's go."  
  
The leader stopped them and walked away from my house.  
The other five stopped talking and followed him.  
  
"Haa~…"  
  
I couldn’t help but sigh.  
Suddenly, the suspicious person walking at the back flinched and turned
around.  
  
"...Hey, did you hear anything just now?"  
"No?"  
"I see…no, it’s nothing."  
  
The effect of the \[Hermit's Robe\] is outstanding.  
The suspicious man who looked back at my location did look in my general
direction, but our eyes didn’t meet. If I hadn’t made a sound, he
wouldn't have even sensed my presence.  
As I kicked the ground to chase after the swiftly departing suspicious
men, my body felt lighter thanks to the \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], and no
matter how much I walk it doesn’t seem like I’ll get tired.  
  
Let's have you guide me to the hideout.
