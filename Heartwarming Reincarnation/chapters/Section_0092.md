# Chapter 92・Memories Resurfacing

I sat on the sofa, with Samyu standing next to the rabbit girl who was
doing a dogeza, and we conducted the questioning. The beast girl no
longer showed any hostility towards me, so I had untied her.  
I asked her why she was there and what she had been doing. To summarise
the story of the beast girl...  
  
“So, you left the beastkin village and have been traveling around, doing
‘good deeds’?”  
“That’s right! It’s a beast-people image-up operation!”  
  
That’s what she said.  
  
“And, of all things, you were helping those who dried up the lake and
sold water at exorbitant prices.”  
“….Uuu. I’m really, really sorry! I didn’t understand…! They said they
were looking for a water source for a village in need, and because I
have good hearing, they asked me to help, so I told them the location of
the water.”  
  
Her pink rabbit ears drooped sadly.  
It seems that those men were able to tap into the water source upstream
of the lake thanks to the rabbit beast girl’s hearing.  
  
“They said that because there was a \[Water Serpent\], they couldn’t get
water. They said they wanted to create a new reservoir upstream. I was
praised, saying ‘As expected of a beast person!'… I was so happy
thinking, ‘Beast-people image-up, a great success!’… Since I’m strong,
they asked me to help, and I diligently dug the reservoir…”  
“And so the lake dried up, the \[Water Serpent\] lost its energy, and
the village was on the verge of being abandoned. What you did only
damaged the image of beast people.”  
“Uuu…”  
  
Her round pink eyes welled up.  
She had acted with good intentions.  
  
“Well, no wonder. It’d be impossible for people who seem to lack any
knowledge or skills to pinpoint a water source with such accuracy, or to
build such a reservoir by hand.”  
  
Hamu, sitting on the windowsill, shrugged wearily.  
Indeed, Hamu had been suspicious from the beginning. Could humans really
do something like that?  
  
“Stealing water resources and extorting money from a village sounds like
something humans would do, but it’s not something an ordinary human
could do. The \[Water Serpent\] probably didn’t expect the water source
to dry up, so it let humans into the forest. The beast person was an
unexpected factor.”  
  
I nodded in agreement with Hamu.  
Since the \[Water Serpent\] made its home in that lake, it must be
protecting it at all times. That's why the village at the foot of the
mountain always had plenty of water.  
The fact that a reservoir was built upstream this time is because it
wouldn’t have been a problem if an ordinary human had left it alone.  
Hearing that, Samyu snorted, "Hmph."  
  
“It’s all your own fault. Shouldn't you direct your self-reproach at
yourself rather than at Lady Reni?”  
“That’s right. I’m truly, truly sorry…”  
“Because of your thoughtless actions, many people suffered. But Lady
Reni saved everyone in the end. So, what should you do now?”  
“Thank you. Thank you.”  
  
The beast girl, still in a dogeza, repeatedly bowed her head towards me.
Samyu looked down at her with cold eyes.  
Seeing her go this far makes my back tingly.  
I wanted to go over and stop her by saying, "That's enough," but Samyu
told me not to get close in case something happens.  
So, I tried to at least change the subject.  
  
“What’s your name?”  
  
My words made the rabbit's ears pop up.  
  
“My name is Karigano.”  
“Karigano~”  
  
I nodded and called her name.  
Karigano, a cute pink rabbit beast girl. She’s currently doing a
beautiful dogeza. And I introduced myself.  
  
“I’m Reni.”  
“Little Reni!”  
  
Karigano raised her head and giggled.  
Instantly, Samyu quickly pressed Karigano’s forehead to the floor.  
  
“Too arrogant.”  
“I’m sorry!”  
  
Samyu…  
  
“Karigano isn’t very clever…. I’m really sorry for causing trouble to
Little Reni and everyone. It’s really good that Little Reni helped make
up for Karigano’s mistake. Thank you so much.”  
  
She pressed her hands and forehead deeply to the floor.  
Seeing that, my back started to tingle again...  
  
“Karigano, you thought you were doing it for the village, right?”  
“I might have been deceived...no. It was Karigano’s fault for not
thinking deeply.”  
"...You wanted to help someone, and you thought you'd try your best. And
it's sad that it all ended in failure."  
  
…I always make mistakes too.  
I tend to act impulsively when I get an idea, and I’m rather similar to
Karigano in that way. Therefore—  
  
“Reni thinks, if Karigano isn’t sad, then it’s okay.”  
“Fweh?”  
  
Karigano’s ears twitched at what I said.  
And, as if involuntarily, she lifted her face and stared at me.  
  
“Lake, back to normal. Village, back to normal. Reni, okay.”  
  
I laughed softly.  
  
“Nothing’s wrong.”  
  
Right?  
  
“L-Little Reni…!”  
  
Suddenly, Karigano’s cheeks flushed.  
And she shuddered slightly.  
  
“Little Reni is so, so kind…! I’ve decided! I want Little Reni to become
the head of the Beast-People Image-Up Club!”  
“Beast-People Image-Up…?”  
  
I tilted my head at the unfamiliar phrase.  
Karigano nodded, “Mhm mhm!” and started jumping up and down.  
  
“It’s a club I made! There’s only Karigano, but from now on, we’ll do it
together, Little Reni!”  
“Ah, eh? But Reni isn’t a beast person, you know?”  
  
That’s right. Karigano should have seen it.  
I’m currently wearing the \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\] now, but if I take them
off, I’ll become an elf with round ears. If I have a \[Mana Rampage\],
I’ll become an elf with pointy ears.  
  
“Little Reni looks like that when wearing that item?”  
“Mhm.”  
“Then it’s okay! When you wear that, you look just like a beast person!
Little Reni will definitely improve the image of beast people! Let's do
club activities together!”  
  
Karigano went "paaa!" with a laugh, delighted at having come up with a
wonderful idea.  
But I…  
  
“…Reni probably isn’t very good at that.”  
  
I never joined any clubs in junior high or high school.  
I always stood out in group activities and irritated the people around
me. I didn't know what to do and I always found myself unable to say
anything.  
Hearing the words ‘club activities’ reminded me of my pre-reincarnation
self, and I felt a sharp pain in my chest.  
I gripped my chest tightly and breathed shallowly. Then, all of a
sudden, Samyu was in front of me...  
  
“Lady Reni, what’s wrong? Are you in pain?”  
  
I was clutching my chest tightly. Then I felt something warm touch my
hand. This is…Samyu’s hand.  
  
“Samyu…”  
“Lady Reni, is there something wrong with your chest?”  
“….Nn, nothing.”  
  
The warmth of Samyu’s hand was transferred to mine, and my chest became
warm as well.  
I had been unconsciously holding my breath, and I let out a sigh of
relief. The pain in my chest went away.  
  
“Look here.”  
“…Hamu?”  
  
Hearing the unusually serious voice, I looked up to see Hamu peering at
me.  
  
“Little elf, how are you now? Is something wrong?”  
“No, I’m fine.”  
"I see."  
  
Hamu furrowed her brows, looking troubled.  
  
“Did you feel like you were using mana just now?”  
“No, Reni’s chest was just hot, not using any.”  
  
I tilted my head at Hamu’s question.  
I don't feel like I used any mana at all. My chest just hurt because I
remembered some unpleasant memories from my past life.  
…Come to think of it, I feel like I’ve been remembering things from my
past life more often recently. And they’re all unpleasant memories.  
That black vortex that swallowed me last time I had a \[Mana Rampage\].
Could that have been the trigger?  
At my response, Hamu lowered her eyes.  
  
“…If that’s the case, then what does this mean?”  
  
Then, she sighed, deep in thought.  
  
“The world is distorted now.”
