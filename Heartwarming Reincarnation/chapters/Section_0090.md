# Chapter 90・I Got the \[Water Serpent\] Treasure!

The revitalized \[Lake of Refreshing Rain\] is very, very beautiful.  
The water is so clear you can see all the way to the bottom, where
colorful aquatic plants sway gently, changing the color of the lake's
surface with each movement.  
The beauty of the lake, as depicted in CG, was due to these plants. In
reality, it’s even more beautiful than in the CG—  
  
“It's not ‘Okay’! It's not ‘Okay!!’”  
  
—As I was appreciating the lake’s surface, Hamu was scolding me.  
  
“Did ‘defeat’ mean to blow it away?! Little elf, you haven’t forgotten
your objective, have you?!”  
  
I sat on the lakeshore. Hamu, hands on hips, scolded me incessantly.  
The \[Naga\] had returned to the lake, its head popping out from the
water and looking at me.  
Hamu flew up in a panic and brought the \[Naga\], which had almost
become a cloud (it practically was), back down from the sky.  
The lake was still warm, but the \[Naga\] doesn’t seem to mind.
Groundwater inflow seems to keep it at a comfortable temperature.  
  
“Objective…”  
“That’s right! I explained it clearly, didn’t I?!”  
“Objec…tive…”  
  
Prompted by Hamu, I considered why I had fought the \[Naga\]. Um…  
  
“Restore water. Naga gets stronger. Exciting. Defeat…”  
“Wait, wait, wait! That’s not it! It’s the treasure! To find my treasure
and stabilize your strange body, your mana anomaly!”  
“…Waa…”  
  
That’s right…!!  
When Hamu said that, I was taken aback.  
It's not that I forgot. I don’t think so. I just couldn’t say it right
away! The battle with the \[Naga\] had been so much fun that I’d
carelessly forgotten the ultimate goal….  
I’m always like this…. I get so absorbed in what’s right in front of me
that I just charge ahead….  
My shoulders slumped in self-disappointment.  
Then, Samyu, who had been sitting next to me, stood up hurriedly.  
  
“Lady Reni, this is no problem at all! The dragon said that to obtain
the treasure, you had to defeat the \[Naga\]! Lady Reni did just that.
There was no specification on how it had to be defeated.”  
“Specify how to defeat it?! I never imagined you’d blow it into the
sky!”  
“Lady Reni is an exceptional case.”  
“I’ve fully grasped that! Don’t say it so proudly!”  
  
Hamu interrupted Samyu, who had puffed out her chest.  
Samyu then furrowed her brow and glared at Hamu, saying, “Huh?”  
  
“First of all, whose side are you on? Are you Lady Reni's ally or enemy?
Is there any value in the words of someone who cannot make their
position clear?"  
“Guh, I am \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\], the Foundation of the World!
I’m here for the balance of the world! I merely wanted to prevent the
young elf from disappearing along with the jewel!”  
“In that case, you should have simply handed over the treasure quietly.
You simply guided her to the \[Naga\] and let her fight. Lady Reni
didn’t blame such a dragon, and through her determined spirit, precious
magic, and amazing quick wit, she led us to victory. And now you're
going to complain about the way she fought.”  
“I don’t take sides with anyone! …That’s how the world is!”  
  
Hamu was being pushed back by Samyu, grumbling.  
Hamu wants to obtain the treasure to save the world and stabilize my
mana abnormality. However, she only intended to guide me to the
locations and didn’t want to interfere further…or perhaps she
couldn't.  
Hamu is \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]. As her name suggests, she is the
foundation of the world, and the world exists thanks to her. The game's
cinematic explained that \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] is considered the
world itself.  
She always maintains an neutral stance and never takes sides with
anyone.  
  
“The humans, the villagers, and the \[Naga\] you blew away… from my
perspective, they are all the same. That includes the elf and the young
elf. I… can only watch. I will not interfere unnecessarily in the lives
of those on the surface!”  
  
After saying this, Hamu looked away from us.  
I nodded in agreement. Hamu initially appeared to retrieve the jewel
from me, the vessel (though Samyu had kept charging forward and knocked
her away). My life or death was inconsequential.  
Now, she’s traveling with me to prevent the world’s destruction.  
Hamu is neither an enemy nor an ally.  
Samyu let out a sigh.  
  
“If you wish to remain in that detached position, then so be it.
However, please refrain from speaking to Lady Reni in that manner!”  
“But the young elf was clearly losing sight of her objective!”  
“Lady Reni puts all her effort into everything she does! It’s
wonderful!”  
“That’s not the point! The \[Naga\]’s treasure is inside the \[Naga\]!
If you blow it away, you can’t get it!”  
“Is that so?”  
  
I was watching their exchange, but when she said the treasure couldn't
be obtained, I said, "Huh?"  
Then, Hamu nodded and said, "That's right," and turned her gaze towards
the \[Naga\].  
  
“There, give it.”  
  
At those words, the \[Naga\] heaved… yes, it heaved…  
  
“Waow…”  
  
Along with a spurt of gastric fluid, something shiny was ejected onto
the shore.  
  
“There, that’s the treasure. The \[Naga\]’s stomach juices are poisonous
and dangerous. The treasure has also been in its body for many years, so
the poison has seeped into it. Approach carefully.”  
“Lady Reni, please wait there!”  
  
As Samyu said this, she avoided the \[Naga\]’s gastric fluid and
carefully picked up the treasure using arrows like chopsticks. Then, she
dropped it into the lake.  
Immediately, a hissing sound erupted, and dark smoke rose from around
the treasure.  
  
“To purify it without hesitation in this beautiful lake… does the elf
have no hesitation…?”  
“I cannot give Lady Reni such a filthy thing. I’ll clean it thoroughly
before giving it to you!”  
“Mmn…”  
  
I wondered if it was okay to wash gastric fluid in such a beautiful
lake… but since Samyu didn’t seem to mind, I guess it’s fine… mhm.  
I subtly averted my gaze from Samyu, who was working, and looked at Hamu
floating on the lake.  
  
“Hamu, thank you.”  
“Hmm?”  
“Thanks to Hamu, I got the treasure.”  
“Hmm.”  
“You brought the \[Naga\] back. Thank you.”  
  
Hamu seemed to not understand my thanks and just widened her eyes at
first.  
Upon processing the rest of what I had to say, it seems she realised
what I was thanking her for, her cheeks turned red and she laughed,
"Fuhahahaha!"  
  
“Yes! That’s right! Because I’m here!…That’s right! You can fight as you
like! Because I’m here! That’s right, that’s right!!”  
“You criticize Lady Reni’s fighting style, and then you tell her to
fight however she likes. Which is it?”  
“It was the young elf who dealt the blow! Returning the \[Naga\] to the
lake isn’t taking sides…Umu! The world has judged that the \[Naga\]
should be in this lake and protected!”  
“In that case, Lady Reni’s thanks aren’t necessary. Lady Reni is too
humble.”  
“Guh, ngh.”  
  
Samyu retrieved the treasure from the lake’s surface and gently placed
it on the shore.  
However, the poison seemed to remain, and the ground where she placed
the treasure was sizzling.  
If I put that treasure in my item box, it would probably be \[cursed\]….
It's the kind that gives you a bad status effect...  
  
“By the way, Lady Reni, what was that technique you used to launch the
\[Naga\] out of the lake?”  
“Ah, the bubble thing?”  
“Yes. That’s what Lady Reni called it.”  
"That's right, that's right, what was that?"  
“Um, I don’t fully understand, but…”  
  
It’s a phenomenon called “superheating.” Normally, a liquid that has
reached its boiling point will form bubbles. However, there are cases
where, even though the boiling point is reached, no bubbles form, and
the liquid becomes superheated. In that case, the superheated liquid
will boil instantly upon the impact or fall of a foreign object. The
generated bubbles will expand and rise rapidly.  
Boiling stones are used in science experiments to prevent this. I
disliked group experiments, so I don’t have fond memories of them.  
During my hikikomori days in Japan, a milk tea I heated in the microwave
superheated, causing a terrible mess. Fortunately, I didn’t get burned,
but cleaning up the milk tea that had splattered inside the microwave
was a sad experience….  
The phenomenon I had looked into at that time was put into use here.
Microwaves are prone to superheating.  
I explained haltingly, to the best of my ability, using words that would
make sense in this world, and Samyu nodded with admiration while Hamu
raised one eyebrow.  
  
“As expected of Lady Reni. Not only do you know about this phenomenon,
but it's amazing that you were able to think of it and put it into
action so quickly…. I must also continue to acquire knowledge and
improve my quick thinking…”  
“This young elf is truly mysterious. One moment she seems to know
nothing, and the next she uses this amazing knowledge, and her abilities
are exceptional…”  
“Ah, Lady Reni! The purification seems to be complete!”  
  
Samyu said this and ran towards me with the treasure in her hands.  
Apparently, it’s safe to hold now.  
  
“Lady Reni, here you are.”  
“Waow!”  
  
Samyu respectfully offered me the treasure.  
I gently accepted it. This shape is—  
  
“Dagger.”  
  
—A dagger.  
  
The blade length is about 30cm. It’s encased in a golden sheath adorned
with numerous jewels.  
The hilt is decorated with delicate gold craftsmanship, making it more
of an ornamental piece than a practical weapon.  
I drew the dagger from its sheath. Despite having been in the \[Naga\]’s
stomach, there were no chips or rust on the blade. The blade is straight
and double-edged. It glistened silver in the sunlight.  
I was mesmerized by its beauty.  
And then I muttered those words.  
  
“Status.”  
  
And! This is what I want to see! The stats!  
This is an item I didn’t obtain in the game. I want to know the item
name and effects!  
  
\* \[Naga’s Dagger\]  
\* One of the treasures of \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]. It was created
to save the world from peril when \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] fell into
slumber.  
\* Always Active: \[Mana Manipulation\] +200%, \[Magic Resistance\]
+200%  
\* When Used: \[One-time Magic Usage Amount\] +100%, \[Magic Power\]
+100%  
  
“Ahh…”  
  
This is a magical cheat weapon…. To be honest, the attack power isn’t
that strong. My \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\] from my previous life are far
superior as weapons.  
But the magic buffs are amazing. I shouldn’t use it as my main weapon,
but as a support weapon.  
And—  
  
“Ah… my body feels lighter.”  
  
—M-my body feels so light…!  
Up until now, I haven’t really noticed anything wrong with my body.
Well, maybe I had, but I started in this world as a baby who couldn’t
move, and I’m still only four years old. When I had a \[Mana Rampage\],
I felt it was strange because I had a fever and was sleepy, but when I
didn’t, I thought it was normal.  
  
“I’ll run.”  
  
I equipped the dagger on my waist and removed the \[Cat’s Paw
Gloves\].  
And then, “te-te-te-te!” I ran along the shore.  
  
“Lady Reni?”  
“What’s this, all of a sudden?”  
  
I turned back halfway and returned to Samyu. Of course, I’m still much
slower than when I’m a cat. But still…  
  
“Reni, is running faster!”  
“Y-yes, that’s right! Yes, definitely!”  
  
I quickly ran out of breath, but if my previous top speed was 50%, it
feels like it’s now about 70%...!  
  
“Hmm, hmm. That’s the power of the treasure. The young elf lacked an
appropriate vessel for the amount mana. The treasure strengthens the
vessel and allows you to withstand the mana circulation. It’s working
out well. It’s something that an elf would eventually acquire as they
grow, but for now, it’s best to rely on the power of the treasure.”  
“Mhm!”  
“I’m so relieved… I’m so glad, Lady Reni…!”  
  
Samyu’s eyes started to water.  
It’s only one treasure, but if I get all three, I don’t think I’ll have
any more \[Mana Rampages\]. These treasures are amazing!  
  
“Reni was fast?”  
“Yes! Like the speed of light!”  
“That’s fast.”  
  
I never thought it would be as fast as light. I know that’s impossible,
but I’m happy that Samyu said it so directly.  
Without thinking, I hugged her tightly.  
I looked up at Samyu and giggled—  
  
“Fugh… guh, deadly…”  
  
—Samyu, still with tear-filled eyes, rolled her eyes back.  
Oh, no, no, this is bad…!  
  
“Samyu! You’re falling!”  
  
Here, here! This is the shore! That way is the lake…!  
  
“Gggghhh…”  
“Samyu!”  
“Fgafgabkugagakbubug”  
  
Her head is submerged…! She’s drowning…!  
I desperately tried to pull the drowning Samyu to the shore.  
Suddenly, a high-pitched, unfamiliar voice echoed—  
  
“Not a beastkin…!! You deceived me! I saw it! Human, I’ll never forgive
you!”  
  
—A girl with a knife charged towards me.
