# Chapter 72・I'm Stronger Now

After greeting Hasano, the queen of the Elven Forest, I underwent a
\[Mana Appraisal\] and was guided to a large tree palace-like structure,
the Queen's residence.  
First, I borrowed a bed to rest and slept for a while. Ever since the
\[Seal\] was released, I've been getting sleepy very quickly.  
I arrived in the Elven Forest sometime between evening and night, but I
apparently woke up once to eat and then went back to sleep.  
Right now, I can hear the chirping of birds, and sunlight is streaming
in through the window. It’s a beautiful day.  
I slept well, so I don’t feel sluggish.  
So.  
  
"Status"  
  
I have a lot of new information, so let's check it out!  
There are some new entries and changes...  
  
• Name: Reni Shurm Guora  
• Race: Elf (Mana Rampage)  
• Age: 4  
• Level: 999 (-90%)  
  
"Mana Rampage."  
  
Previously, it was \[Elf (Sealed)\], but it's now changed to \[Elf (Mana
Rampage)\]. As Samyu and Hasano mentioned, I seem to be in a state of
Mana Rampage.  
And—  
  
"Minus, decreased!"  
  
The negative modifier displayed next to my level has changed from 97% to
90%!  
I couldn’t help but laugh.  
  
"I walked hard."  
  
I walked a lot while traveling after parting from my parents.  
Samyu explained that building up my body would make me stronger, and
that's exactly right. Seeing it reflected in the numbers was moving.  
I have to keep working hard.  
And I discovered another entry that was different from what I had seen
before.  
  
"...Bug?"  
  
What is this? Is it a bug?  
  
"My mana is strange..."  
  
The mana value. Something is wrong with the mana value.  
Up until now, my MP was at its maximum value of 9999, but...  
  
"Double?"  
  
• MP: 19998/9999  
  
The current value exceeds the maximum value. Significantly. By twice as
much.  
Normally, the right side of the slash shows the maximum value you
possess, and the current value on the left side decreases each time you
use mana that consumes MP.  
I don't think the current value should ever exceed the maximum
value...  
  
"Because of the Mana Rampage? Or… Mama's?"  
  
Hasano said it before I fell asleep.  
That I was born with the mana of two people.  
If that's the case, my MP 9999 and my mother's MP 9999 have both become
mine.  
  
"The power of the Jewel...?"  
  
My mother wished on the \[Jewel\] to become human. As a result, she lost
her mana and became human.  
Considering the timeline, along with what’s happened so far:  
  
• The \[Jewel\] granted my mother's wish, absorbed her mana, and sealed
it.  
• My mother's mana, MP: 9999, was stored in the \[Jewel\].  
• The \[Jewel\] was passed down from my mother to me.  
• The \[Jewel\]'s ability to absorb mana continued, absorbing and
sealing my MP: 9999.  
• The power of the \[Jewel\] in \[The Wandering Capital, Riwander\]
dispelled the sealing ability of the \[Jewel\] within me.  
  
As a result, my mother's mana and my original mana returned to my body
at once.  
  
"...I'm glad everything turned out okay."  
  
Reflecting on my condition, I feel a little remorse.  
When the \[Seal\] was released, Count Gaillard was right in front of me,
so I was probably excited.  
All I could think about was purifying the many Living Mail and helping
the other children still in the facility, so I didn't care about the
return of my mana, and I didn't hesitate to use it all at once. But
considering that MP: 19998 suddenly started circulating through my body,
it wouldn't have been strange if I had gone crazy at that moment.  
Samyu's words, "It's a miracle to me that Lady Reni is acting normally,"
were certainly true.  
  
"Will it always be like this?"  
  
I must have used a lot of mana to purify the Living Mail.  
But my current value is double. Maybe the maximum value is MP: 9999, but
that's my own maximum value, and while I'm with the \[Jewel\], maybe
double is normal.  
In other words.  
  
"Stronger than the game"  
  
I couldn’t help but laugh.  
My mana value was already at its maximum in the game. Now it far exceeds
that. And I can do \[Mana Manipulation\], which wasn't in the game. My
potential is at its peak, isn't it?  
As expected of the strongest four-year-old. Still so much room to
grow.  
  
"Lady Reni, are you awake?"  
"Samyu. Please come in."  
  
While laughing alone in bed, there was a knock on the door.  
Samyu seems to have come.  
  
"Lady Reni, how are you feeling?"  
"Mhm, I'm fine."  
  
I slept well, so I'm not sleepy and I don’t feel too hot.  
When I answered, Samyu looked relieved.  
  
"Last night, we talked about Lady Reni. Queen Hasano seems to have a way
to control your current condition."  
"Really?"  
  
I heard that elves who suffer from a \[Mana Rampage\] die, and that's
why my mother wished on the \[Jewel\], but that's no longer the case?  
  
"Queen Hasano seems to have been researching it ever since your mother
experienced a \[Mana Rampage\]. To prevent any more friends from
dying."  
"Amazing."  
  
I don't know what kind of research it is, but it must be very
difficult.  
Hasano is also the Queen, so she probably has even more struggles.  
Remembering Hasano's gentle gaze and the hand that stroked my head, my
heart swelled.  
  
"It doesn’t seem to be a fundamental solution, but it should eliminate
your fatigue, sleepiness, and fever. The goal is to wait for your body
to grow so that it can withstand the mana."  
"Mhm."  
  
Samyu's explanation was easy to understand  
As usual, she explained what we're going to do and what will happen, in
a way that even a child like me could understand, so it's very
reassuring.  
In reality, it would be best if we could put an end to the \[Mana
Rampage\] entirely, but that would mean losing all my mana like my
mother.  
This time, it's a method to deal with the symptoms I'm experiencing.  
  
"The method is to narrow the \[Mana Pathways\]."  
"Mana Pathways… narrow?"  
"Yes. Do you remember the explanation about the difference between elves
and humans being the circulation of mana?"  
"Mhm."  
  
She told me that elves have mana circulating like blood. That's why
their magic is strong and their lifespans are so long.  
  
"Right now, your body has too much mana circulating due to the sudden
increase, putting a strain on the Mana Pathways."  
"I see. The path of mana is the mana pathway."  
"Yes. It seems that the expansion of the \[Mana Pathways\] is causing
lethargy, drowsiness, and fever. Therefore, I think it would be best to
reduce the now-thickened \[Mana Pathways\] to a size suitable for Lady
Reni's body."  
"Okay. I'll do it."  
  
I nodded at Samyu's words.  
Narrowing the \[Mana Pathways\] might limit the amount of mana I can
use, making me weaker. But it's probably best to do so for now.  
It's hard to live with this sleepiness and fever, and I understand that
the right amount for my body is important.  
My body is still four years old. It's too young to handle MP: 19998.  
When I nodded, Samyu nodded vigorously as well.  
  
"Then, Lady Reni, I think Queen Hasano will explain the details. First,
please get changed and we’ll go see Queen Hasano. The preparations are
already underway."  
"Mhm."  
  
Now then, let's narrow the mana pathways!
