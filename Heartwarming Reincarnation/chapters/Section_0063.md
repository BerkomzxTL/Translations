# Chapter 63・I’m Here To Help

Having finished our rest(?), Samyu , Pio, and I infiltrated the capital
city. I concealed myself under the hood of my \[Hermit's Robe\], and
Samyu carried me to get over the high wall. Pio went through the main
gate using her connections.  
The capital city is truly the center of the domain; it's incredibly
vast.  
If Count Gaillard, the lord, has kidnapped Carrie, the most suspicious
place would be the castle. However, it's unlikely we could openly
enter.  
Considering that all the facilities we've encountered so far were
underground, it's probably underground.  
Pio gathered information from soldiers working in the castle, and Samyu
did some inquiries in the castle town. They obtained testimony that a
carriage glowing blue was seen last night.  
It’s probably the Death Horse's carriage.  
The sighting was reported on the north side of the castle. The castle is
located on the north side of the territory of the capital city, and on
the other side of the wall is a forest. The sighting was near that
forest.  
The three of us started heading towards that direction. At that moment,
fireworks went off into the sky—  
  
"What are those sparks!?"  
"Lady Reni!"  
"Mhm. These are Reni's fireworks."  
  
Red and white cat-shaped fireworks spread across the blue sky.  
It's the same design as the fireworks I made in the game.  
  
"Hurry."  
"Yes!"  
"Your Highness!"  
  
Marking the spot where the fireworks launched, we ran towards it.  
With the power of my \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], Samyu's \[Mana
Manipulation\], and Pio's horse, Juliana, equipped with \[Swift
Hooves\], we arrived quickly.  
  
"It's here."  
  
We arrived in the depths of the forest, the only place with no trees and
just open land.  
At a glance, it looked like a small hill, with beautifully manicured
grass. A pretty stained-glass window was set into the slope.  
  
"It seems there's an underground facility underneath here. This is the
only part that’s connected to the outside, and functions as a source of
light."  
"The glass over there is broken."  
"Did Her Highness throw Reni's item from there?"  
"Probably."  
  
Carrie is down there.  
Therefore,  
  
"Let's excavate!"  
  
I took out my \[Pickaxe (Special)\].  
The, shouting "Eii!", I thrust it into the slope.  
The ground crumbled, a huge hole opened up, and I softly fell.  
What I saw was—  
  
"Carrie~"  
  
The room I destroyed appeared similar to the village church.  
A statue of the goddess, a stained-glass window for lighting, and Carrie
captured in the center.  
Her hands were held down, pinned to the ground, and a charred
\[Substitute Doll\] lay on the floor.  
  
"Safe."  
  
The atrium was about two stories below. Because of the hole I made,
sunlight poured down.  
I also saw Samyu land safely behind me.  
  
"Sorry I’m late."  
  
Carrie was just a single hop away.  
My face, no longer covered by the hood, was visible to her.  
  
"Reni…"  
"Mhm."  
  
Carrie, usually composed and dignified, had her eyebrows drawn together,
and tears were dripping from her eyes.  
  
"Reni… Reni…"  
"It's okay."  
  
Carrie is crying.  
The moment I saw her tears, my chest burned.  
  
"I'll save you right away."  
  
Suppressing the heat that threatened to overwhelm me, I gathered it in
my right hand.  
Then—  
  
"Become light!"  
  
The light that overflowed reached the Living Mail holding down Carrie.  
As the two were enveloped in light, they lost their power and collapsed
on the spot with a crash.  
  
"Reni, Reni…!"  
  
The now freed Carrie ran toward me.  
I hugged her tightly as she leaped into my arms.  
  
"Are you hurt anywhere?"  
"No…!"  
"Are you in pain?"  
"Nothing hurts anymore. Because Reni came for me!"  
  
After saying that, Carrie hugged me tightly.  
Judging from the strength of her hug, it seems that she’s unharmed.  
I let out a sigh of relief, patting her back gently to calm her.  
At that moment, a voice echoed from deep within the underground
chamber.  
  
"This light…"  
  
Beyond the collapsed Living Mail.  
In a place where the light couldn't reach, stood a figure.  
His gray hair was slicked back, his expression calm, his voice as steady
as ever.  
  
"Count Gaillard."  
  
Unlike our meeting at the tea party, he was wearing a white robe like
the village priest's. A crimson cloth with gold embroidery hung from his
shoulders.  
Indeed, he looks exactly like a "bishop".  
  
"I couldn’t see the light coming from Her Highness."  
"I have never once said it was my power."  
"…Ah, yes. That's certainly true."  
  
Count Gaillard nodded several times in response to Carrie's words.  
Then, he smiled gently.  
  
"I thought that Your Highness, who was weak, had finally obtained the
power of the Jewel, but it seems Your Highness possesses nothing after
all."  
"Shut up!"  
  
Pio responded to Count Gaillard's words.  
Apparently, she had descended into the underground chamber via a rope
lowered from the ceiling.  
Sword in hand, she boldly confronted Count Gaillard.  
  
"Oh, is that Her Highness's knight? I thought you were heavily wounded,
why are you here? Well, it'll just be the same result."  
  
After saying that, Count Gaillard gestured behind him  
From the shadows in the back, Living Mail advanced towards Pio.  
Six of them. They stood in the way to protect Count Gaillard.  
  
"Ugh…"  
  
Seeing the Living Mail, Pio slashed at one of them without hesitation.
The clash of metal on metal. A normal person would have fallen from the
impact, but the Living Mail stood its ground.  
As expected, physical attacks are ineffective against Living Mail. As
Pio did before, she has to target the joints of their armor and somehow
sew them up.  
And then—  
  
"Hah!!"  
  
With a shout, Samyu shot an arrow.  
In time with the sound, Pio quickly moved.  
Pio suddenly disappeared, and in her place, the arrow approached. The
Living Mail couldn't dodge and was struck in the stomach.  
  
"Giiigii…"  
  
The arrow pierced through, embedding itself in the wall behind.  
With a hole in its stomach, the Living Mail’s movements slowed down and
it slowly retreated. Immediately, another Living Mail stepped forward to
replace it.  
Samyu's attacks are effective, but not fatal. Moreover, there are many
of them. If this continues…  
  
"My chest is hot…"  
  
I focused my mind to gather the heat.  
Then, Carrie whispered softly so that only I could hear.  
  
"Reni, is it alright?"  
"Hmm?"  
"If you use light here, Gaillard will notice you."  
"Mhm. But everyone wants to go home."  
  
The Living Mail appear to be under Gaillard's complete control.  
Though they seem to lack will, I can hear their voices.  
The captured children, Carrie, and the Living Mail. To save everyone, I
think using this light is best.  
Therefore—  
  
"Become light!"  
  
I released the accumulated heat from my right hand.  
The overflowing light enveloped three Living Mail.  
  
"Again."  
  
Since I didn't manage to defeat them all in one go, I focused on the
heat in my chest again.  
And—  
  
"Become light!"  
  
The third time today.  
The light overflowing from my right hand enveloped two Living Mail.
However…  
  
"…It feels kind of weak."  
  
For the time being, both of them lost their strength and collapsed. I
feel like I could hear a faint hissing sound coming from my hand towards
the end…  
Like I'm emptying the contents of a glass bottle.  
  
"Lady Reni, are you alright?"  
"Mhm. Samyu, please go and rescue the children."  
"But…"  
"Because I'd be troubled if they were left alone."  
"Understood. Call for me if anything happens. And use items promptly."  
"It's okay."  
  
Samyu's eyebrows furrowed with worry.  
But after hearing my words, she nodded firmly.  
  
"The children are beyond that door. They seem to be in separate rooms
along the corridor."  
"Understood."  
  
After receiving the information from Carrie, Samyu flew towards the
door.  
Then, to stop her, Count Gaillard moved the Living Mail.  
Although I turned five of them into light, there are still many left.  
I focused on the heat in my chest once again.  
…There's still more. It's okay.  
I gathered it in my right hand—  
  
"Become light!!"
