# Chapter 13・My Child Is a Genius 2

On the night Reni used a talisman to hide their house.  
The couple decided to discuss the promissory notes that had been
returned to them.  
Three chairs sat around their four-person dining table. As usual, the
couple sat opposite each other, sipping lukewarm water from their cups.
Then, they sighed.  
  
“...What do you think this means?”  
“I… I think Reni did something.”  
“I think so too.”  
  
The wife responded seriously to her husband’s question.  
Their conversation, of course, centered on the returned promissory
notes. The two notes on the dining table had plagued the couple for
years.  
And yet, they’d been returned effortlessly.  
…by their three-year-old daughter’s hand.  
  
“When a villager ran to my hunting ground and said that strangers had
entered the house, I was terrified. I was relieved when I managed to
make it in time and drive them off, but when I realized Reni was
missing, I felt like I was dying..."  
“Me too. I know I hid her in the closet, but this paper was the only
thing there."  
  
The couple recalled the moment they opened the closet where Reni should
have been.  
She was nowhere to be seen. They called her, but she didn’t answer.  
Knowing Reni, they searched the house, thinking that she might have
hidden somewhere safer than the closet, but she was nowhere to be
found.  
Then, searching the closet again, they found this unexpectedly fine
piece of paper. There was some clumsy writing on it—  
  
“‘Leave it to me’…”  
“That’s something Reni sometimes says. Since we’ve been together,
whenever I’m a little troubled, she’d say, ‘Leave it to Reni,’ and she’d
always solve the problem…. So I knew right away that Reni was up to
something, but I never imagined she’d even handle the promissory
notes…”  
  
The couple’s eyes held a complex mixture of emotions as they looked at
the two promissory notes Reni had retrieved.  
  
“...I’m here, and Reni is here. We’ve been trying to keep this from
being discovered all this time…”  
“We couldn’t have those promissory notes made public. That’s why we paid
what they demanded, but we should have thought more about it…”  
  
The couple had discussed whether to take countermeasures against the
exorbitant debt collectors. But ultimately, they couldn't use any method
that might put the young Reni in even a little danger.  
They knew it was a passive approach, but they thought that paying and
getting them to leave them alone would be best. That's how they had
lived until now—  
  
“The time has come…”  
"That's right. Reni didn't miss the opportunity. ……She chose her own
path."  
“That's right.”  
  
The couple nodded in agreement, their expressions a mixture of tears and
laughter.  
  
“I’m so glad Reni is our daughter.”  
“Yes, I am too.”  
“I think we couldn’t have overcome this without Reni.”  
“Reni is the best daughter.”  
  
Words the couple repeated time and again.  
Over and over.  
  
“Reni is a genius.”  
“Yes, a genius.”  
  
Their conviction grew stronger. But at the same time—  
  
“We can’t keep this hidden.”  
"I was thinking that at the very least, we could wait until she grew a
little bigger..."  
  
As a family, in this village.  
It was only for three years. Haunted by debt, they hadn't been able to
spend much time together as a family.  
But for the couple, those days were precious.  
  
“When I found Reni today, she was playing in the dirt in front of the
house, just like always.”  
“Come to think of it, she had dirt on her cheeks.”  
“I was so worried, but when I picked her up, she looked puzzled, like
‘what?’”  
“...I can picture it. Reni always says ‘It’s okay’ with so much
confidence.”  
“And she gave me the promissory notes, saying ‘Here you go’…”  
“With a bright smile, ‘I found them!’…”  
“But there’s no way those notes were just lying around…”  
“Reni is so confident, but that's what makes her cute.”  
“That’s right.”  
  
Thinking of their precious daughter brought a natural smile to their
faces.  
Because of that—  
  
“…I’ll contact that person. I’m sure they’ll protect Reni.”  
“Yes…that’s…right. Yes. Please do."
