# Chapter 93・The Young Elf Is a Natural Disaster

―Something strange was happening in the world.  
It was something that couldn't be overlooked as \[The Black Bahamut
Dragon\].  
Because this world was something the dragon itself had created.  
  
Long ago, there was an incredibly large and powerful \[Black Dragon\].
Having lived alone for a long time, it had grown weary of life.  
At that moment, God called out to it. "Will you not create a world
within yourself?"  
Having already lived an immense amount of time, the \[Black Dragon\]
nodded at God’s words, saying, "That would be interesting."  
  
―With its own body as the foundation, seven \[Divine Jewels\] were used
to ensure stability.  
The \[Black Dragon\] became the \[Black Dragon of the World's
Foundation\] and fell into a long slumber.  
Various events occurred in the world, and plants and animals changed in
many ways. But no matter what happened, life continued.  
It entrusted itself to the eternal ebb of time, occasionally sending out
a fragment of its consciousness to observe changes in the world.  
A single person, a single country, a single race, a single region. They
may be heading towards extinction, but the survival of the world would
not be affected.  
Protecting the world as the foundation. Nothing stood in the way of that
goal. It simply watched, and then slept again.  
  
So, when it first sensed the anomaly, it intended to simply watch as
usual.  
What it discovered was the existence of Reni, ‘a young elf possessing a
\[Divine Jewel\]’, at the center of the world's anomaly.  
The \[Divine Jewel\] seemed to be strongly bound to Reni.  
Throughout history, the \[Divine Jewels\] had been used many times, but
the seven \[Divine Jewels\] had always maintained a stable world without
upsetting the balance.  
This situation didn't seem particularly unique. But the world's anomaly,
a small wound, was gradually growing larger.  
Finally unable to ignore this any longer, it created a fragment of its
consciousness and tried to contact Reni.  
Though against its beliefs, it wasn't averse to extinguishing any sparks
for the sake of the world's stability.  
―Killing her isn’t out of the question.  
Thinking this, it confronted Reni.  
  
The result was that the \[Divine Jewel\] and Reni were more strongly
linked than anticipated, making separation difficult. Worse still, they
were on the verge of disappearing from the world together.  
Therefore, it decided that the first thing it needed to do was adjust
Reni, who was too unstable as a vessel.  
Fortunately, elves have long lifespans and large amounts of mana, making
them suitable vessels.  
The plan was to devise a way to keep the \[Divine Jewel\] in the world
until Reni reached the end of her life. But...  
  
"What do you mean the world is distorted? ... Lady Reni isn't
experiencing a \[Mana Rampage\]. Her body is still firmly here."  
  
Samyu said this and gently took Reni's hand.  
In response, Reni released her hand from her chest and clasped
Samyu’s.  
It was just as Samyu said. It was different from when she nearly
disappeared in the Elven Forest. Reni wasn't experiencing a \[Mana
Rampage\], nor was her body fading.  
  
"But... without a doubt, the world has become distorted. Or perhaps...
warped, blurred... centered around the young elf."  
  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] sat cross-legged in the
air, flapping its wings.  
The anomaly had indeed occurred, but it disappeared instantly, and the
world had returned to normal.  
  
"I thought that if the young elf matured as a vessel... but it might be
more urgent than I anticipated."  
"So what does that mean?"  
"I don't know. And it’s because I don't know that things can't continue
like this."  
  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] said this and stared
intently at Reni.  
  
"You like this world, don't you?"  
"Mhm. Reni loves this world."  
  
Her golden eyes were unwavering and there was no lie in them.  
For the \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\], who had made its
body the foundation of the world, these words tickled its heart. The
\[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] liked the moments Reni's eyes
sparkled with excitement.  
  
"I shall sleep."  
"What?"  
  
Samyu frowned and spoke out at the sudden announcement.  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] nodded, "Umu."  
  
"I will tell you the locations of my remaining two treasures, but I
cannot help you."  
"Haah~. While you’ve guided us before, you’ve never actually helped."  
"Well, that's true, but... well... I can no longer watch over
things...."  
"And what difference does watching make?"  
"Ugh..."  
  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] groaned at Samyu's sharp
rebuke.  
It was certainly true. The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\],
having decided to watch over the world without taking sides, had not
done anything so far.  
Although it burned the Elven Forest, that was an act of hostility
towards Reni and Samyu, and it would have been better if it hadn't been
there.  
  
"Hamu, when Reni almost disappeared, you told me to 'concentrate'."  
  
Looking up at the \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\], Reni
murmured, "Thank you."  
  
"Reni didn't disappear because of that."  
"That's right, that's right!"  
  
At Reni's words, the \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\]
chuckled.  
Then cast a downward gaze.  
  
"If the same thing happens again, I won't be able to speak to you, so
you and the young elf will have to overcome it yourselves."  
"Mhm. Reni practiced. It's okay."  
"That's right! Lady Reni has practiced her \[Mana Manipulation\], and
now she can cast special magic freely! The magic she used to blow away
the \[Naga\] was amazing! A \[Mana Rampage\] is highly unlikely to
happen again."  
"Mhm."  
  
Reni and Samyu laughed together.  
Seeing their smiles and trusting relationship, it seemed like things
would be fine unless something extraordinary were to happen. The \[Black
Dragon of the World's Foundation\] felt the same. But...  
  
"Ah... On the other hand, if a 'what if' scenario arises, it means
'something extraordinary' has occurred."  
  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] exclaimed, "Anyway!"  
  
"The young elf and the \[Jewel\] are more important than I anticipated.
I still don't know what it is, but when it happens, a cataclysm will
surely befall the world. Prevention is key!"  
  
Hopefully, this premonition will prove unfounded.  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] looked down at Reni with
a smile.  
  
"The young elf loves this world. She'd be sad if it were gone."  
"Mhm."  
  
Reni looked up at the \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] and
smiled.  
That alone made the \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] feel warm
and fuzzy inside.  
It takes no sides. It merely watches. That is the \[Black Dragon of the
World's Foundation\].  
What is in the heart of that \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\]
is...  
  
"The young elf has a duty to look up at me with sparkling eyes!"  
  
―Reni's shining golden eyes.  
  
It hoped those eyes would never cloud over. The young elf at the center
of the world's upheaval. "It's fun!" she’d say, laughing. As long as the
journey continues...  
  
"I'll give you this. Think of it as a charm. I'm going to sleep, but if
you're ever really in trouble, speak to this."  
  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] said this and gave her
something shining, about the size of Reni's palm.  
  
"This is?"  
"Umu. My inverse scale."  
"Inverse scale? Hamu's?"  
  
Reni, releasing Samyu's hand and receiving the inverse scale, blinked
rapidly.  
Then, she tilted her head in confusion.  
  
"Reni… if Reni touches it, you won’t get angry?"  
"Why?"  
"If you touch a dragon's inverse scale, it gets angry..."  
"That's only if it's growing on me. Since the inverse scale is here,
it's not growing on me now. And you are the one holding the inverse
scale. In other words, if something happens to you, someone will have
touched it!"  
  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\] puffed out its chest with
satisfaction and laughed, "Fuwahahaha!"  
Samyu looked on with displeasure, then whispered to Reni.  
  
"Let's throw it away, Lady Reni. Just toss it."  
"It's my inverse scale! It's precious, powerful, and will surely protect
the young elf!"  
"Giving a scale from its body to Lady Reni... Lady Reni, it's dirty.
Let's throw it away."  
  
However, Reni seemed to be ignoring Samyu's whisper and Hamu's cries,
staring intently at the inverse scale in front of her.  
She exclaimed, "Waooow!" and her eyes sparkled.  
  
"It's black and pretty."  
  
The palm-sized scale was very hard and shone with myriad colors
depending on the angle of the light. Rather than a scale, it looked more
like a large, finely polished gemstone.  
Reni’s eyes melted in the face of its beauty, her eyes glazed over.  
  
"Reni… it's Reni's first item like this."  
  
Seeing Reni so happy, Samyu couldn't say anything.  
She murmured, "It can't be helped," and pouted, looking up at the
\[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\].  
  
"So, before you sleep, you were going to tell us where to go. Where are
the other two?"  
"Umu, \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\] and \[The Forest of Reflection\]."  
"Okay. Now go sleep ."  
"Wait, wait, wait. Listen a bit more. You know where they are, but \[The
Ever-Shifting Desert\]'s terrain changes every time you go there. The
venomous \[Cockatrice\] has one of the treasures, but it wanders around
in the shifting landscape, so it's a pain to find it."  
  
At those words, Samyu sighed, "Haah."  
  
"So, you need a guide for these places, and this dragon can’t guide you
because I’m going to sleep."  
"...Ugh."  
  
Samyu snorted again, "Hmph!"  
Her eyes were cold, her expression seeming to say, "You're useless."  
Then, a cheerful voice rang out.  
  
"Karigano can guide you through \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\]!"  
  
Karigano, the rabbit beast person who had been silent until now, raised
her hand, saying, "Yes, yes, yes!"
