# Chapter 73・We Will Narrow The \[Mana Pathways\]

Hasano was preparing in a room on the first floor of the palace. The
room had high ceilings and was filled with sunlight streaming through
the windows.  
The atmosphere was similar to the church in Niguru Village where the
children had been held, though this felt warmer.  
In the center of the room was a magic circle, an intricate arrangement
of numerous crests. Will standing in the center activate a spell?  
  
“Now then, Reni, before we use the spell, I’ll explain your current
condition. Your \[Mana Pathways\] are dangerously swollen.”  
“Mhm.”  
“If this continues, your \[Mana Pathways\] will break, potentially
resulting in death.”  
  
I nodded in agreement with Hasano’s words.  
It was almost identical to what Samyu had told me. A new piece of
information was that death due to \[Mana Rampage\] seems to be caused by
damage to the \[Mana Pathways\].  
I imagine it to be like a faucet and a plastic hose. A faucet with high
water pressure, with a hose attached to it. Until now, the faucet was
closed, which was fine. But now it's wide open.  
The elves have mana circulating within their bodies, so the end of the
hose would return to the faucet. It circulates through the body,
maintaining balance, and magic is used or \[Mana Manipulation\] is
performed, releasing mana from a desired location as needed.  
But my water pressure is too high, and the hose can’t withstand it. The
hose is getting thicker and thicker, and the outer layer is thinning.  
The strain on the hose is probably causing the fever, fatigue, and
drowsiness, and if the hose ever bursts, I'll die.  
  
“This magic circle will narrow your swollen \[Mana Pathways\] and
strengthen it to withstand the strain of mana circulation.”  
“Amazing…”  
  
Unlike my mother, I won’t stop circulating mana, this spell won’t
prevent a \[Mana Rampage\]. It doesn’t close the main valve.  
The faucet will remain open, the amount of circulating mana will remain
unchanged, and this spell will strengthen the hose.  
The stressed hose will be narrowed to fit my body size, and it'll even
be reinforced.  
Hasano must have done a lot of research to prevent any more elves
becoming like my mother and to save her fellow elves from future
suffering.  
  
“But, Reni, this isn't a perfect spell…”  
  
Hasano frowned painfully.  
  
“Your mana is too powerful. Even if we use this spell to strengthen your
\[Mana Pathways\], it will still swell again, and your body will
continue to feel the strain.”  
“Again?”  
“Relapse… yes, I think so. Therefore, until your body grows to match
your mana… no, it might even be for the rest of your life."  
  
I noticed Samyu next to me flinch when Hasano said that.  
Perhaps it was the first time she had heard this.  
  
“As Reni grows, the \[Mana Pathways\] will also grow stronger. One day,
there may come a time when the balance between the mana you possess, the
circulating mana, and the \[Mana Pathways\] is achieved. But, if your
mana continues to grow stronger as you do…”  
“It will always be painful.”  
“No…”  
  
I started thinking about a future where the \[Mana Pathways\] would
never stabilize.  
Calmly conveying my thoughts, Samyu was the one who reacted.  
  
“If Lady Reni grows, won’t the \[Mana Rampage\] subside?”  
“Of course, I hope so. …But no one knows how she’ll grow.”  
“But… but, that is too much for Lady Reni…”  
  
Samyu’s sorrowful voice.  
She must have considered the persistent fever, fatigue, drowsiness, and
the ever-present danger of death.  
Hasano just looked at Samyu with calm eyes.  
I think Hasano has a doctor-like atmosphere. She examined my body and
spoke calmly, telling me both the good and the bad. That makes her very
trustworthy to me.  
So,  
  
“Samyu, it’s okay.”  
  
I squeezed Samyu’s hand tightly.  
  
“Reni is strong.”  
  
—Because I’m the strongest four-year-old.  
  
“It’s okay.”  
  
My body was starting to feel a little heavier again, but I puffed out my
chest with a huff.  
Then, Samyu’s eyes started to well up—  
  
“Yes… yes… I apologize. I didn’t mean to doubt Lady Reni’s future…”  
“Mhm. I understand.”  
  
She was worried about me.  
  
“I’m happy to hear Samyu’s feelings.”  
  
Having someone worry about me makes me very happy.  
Even though Samyu was suffering, my chest felt warm and fuzzy…  
I laughed softly and snuggled slightly closer to Samyu. Then—  
  
“Ugh…”  
  
—Samyu gasped.  
And then her eyes rolled back… Ah, this is… Bad…  
  
“I, can’t, precious, no way, fatal…”  
  
Samyu collapsed. I couldn’t do anything. Hasano just watched…  
Why is this happening in this sunlit room…?  
Then, Hasano calmly announced,  
  
“Samyu has strongly inherited the nature of the elves. She gets a little
carried away.”  
“A little…”  
  
Maybe a little...  
  
“…Will she get better?”  
  
Hasano seems like a doctor, so maybe she can cure Samyu’s respiratory
distress?  
I asked cautiously, and Hasano smiled kindly.  
  
“Reni, it isn’t like that. Just as I want to scream because I find you
so cute, Samyu can't breathe. It's the natural order of things.”  
“Natural…”  
  
Order…  
  
“My apologies!”  
  
I flinched at Hasano’s kind smile, and Samyu revived as if nothing had
happened.  
Then, she nodded resolutely.  
  
“If Lady Reni’s symptoms continue, I will dedicate all the remaining
jewels to Lady Reni! Even at the cost of my life!”  
“Yes. And I’ll be here too. When Reni’s body feels bad, be sure to come
here immediately. I'll cast the spell again. And I will continue my
research.”  
  
Samyu and Hasano are here for me.  
So, I’m sure it’ll be okay.  
I nodded too.  
  
“Then, let’s begin.”  
“Please.”  
  
I let go of Samyu’s hand and trotted to the center of the magic
circle.  
Hasano moved around to different places while touching the ground.  
The intricate patterns began to glow faintly. The light intensified—  
  
“Now, this is the final step!”  
  
With that voice, the world before my eyes was flooded with light.  
My body sparkled, and—  
  
“Ah, my body feels light.”  
  
My body feels light!  
  
“Thank you, Hasano.”  
“That’s good… it seems to have worked. Come here, let me do a \[Mana
Appraisal\].”  
  
I left the magic circle and headed towards Hasano.  
The fatigue and drowsiness I'd felt since the seal was broken seemed
like a lie.  
After passing through the ring of light, Hasano examined my body. When
she was finished, she breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
“It worked. How do you feel?”  
“I’m not sleepy or tired.”  
“If your body feels strange again, I’ll cast this spell.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
Hasano is my doctor. I'll have to return to the Elven Forest if the
burden on my \[Mana Pathways\] becomes too great again.  
  
“I’m so relieved… Lady Reni…”  
“Mhm. Thanks to Samyu.”  
“Such… undeserved praise. I’m truly relieved that Lady Reni’s physical
discomfort has been cured.”  
  
She noticed I was feeling unwell and immediately recognized it was due
to a \[Mana Rampage\].  
Then, she contacted my mother and brought me here to the Elven Forest. I
really owe Samyu a lot.  
As I was talking to Samyu, Hasano bent down before me.  
  
“And, Reni, I want you to promise me one thing."  
“Promise?”  
“Yes, it’s important to protect your own health.”  
  
Hasano looked at me seriously, her eyes level with mine.  
My own health… I didn't understand, but seeing her expression, I knew it
was very important.  
  
“It is—”  
  
Overwhelmed by Hasano’s serious demeanor, I swallowed nervously.  
But before she could finish—  
  
“Oi!! Elves!! I’ll never forgive you for mocking me!”  
  
—What I heard was.  
  
“The dragon person?”  
  
As if using a megaphone, the voice echoed throughout the Elven Forest.  
The voice belonged to the dragon girl who had become a star many times
thanks to Samyu's charges.  
  
“If you don’t show yourselves, then burn to ashes! Even this ancient
magic is no match for my flames!”  
  
A loud laughter, Fuhahahaha.  
At the same time, the door to the room burst open.  
  
“Your Majesty! It's terrible! The Elven Forest is on fire!”
