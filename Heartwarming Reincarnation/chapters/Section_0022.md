# Chapter 22・It’s a Growth Period

Can this really happen?  
A girl as cute as an idol suddenly rolling her eyes back and then
collapsing…  
I was so surprised by what happened that I couldn't do anything and just
froze.  
Then, after a few seconds, the elf girl regained consciousness and
returned to her previous kneeling posture.  
  
"Apologies. I lost my composure."  
"Mhm... are you okay?"  
"Yes. I just got overwhelmed by my emotions."  
  
Overwhelmed by emotions...?  
  
"By the way, about these documents...?"  
  
The elf girl cleared her throat, changed the subject, and shifted her
gaze to the documents I was holding and the papers scattered on the
floor.  
Picking up one of the papers nearby, she nodded understandingly.  
  
"This is evidence of Mayor Shultem's corruption, isn't it?"  
"Mhm."  
"As expected of Lady Reni. So you came here to find this."  
  
Hmm. Actually, I was thinking I should just destroy the hideout.  
But, there's a big shot behind this. What should I do now...?  
While thinking, I nodded anyway. Then the elf girl smiled gently.  
  
"Please leave this to me. I'll gather more evidence and put it all
together."  
"Really?"  
"Yes. Please take care, Lady Reni."  
"Okay."  
  
I accepted the elf girl's offer and handed her the documents I was
holding.  
This girl and I have just met. Come to think of it, I haven’t even asked
her name.  
Maybe I shouldn't trust her so easily, but my \[Detection Bell\] isn't
ringing, and she's probably an ally. That's what my intuition tells
me.  
...Or rather, it's not exactly intuition.  
I mean, someone who cries just from being patted and collapses just from
having their tears wiped away is rare. If she’s actually an enemy, she
should act more convincingly!  
So, I handed her the ledger I found in the safe.  
The elf girl respectfully received the documents from me and quickly
gathered the papers scattered on the ground.  
  
"Now then, Lady Reni, let's go home. Your mother is worried about
you."  
"Mama."  
  
Come to think of it, the elf girl came after hearing from my mother.  
If you knew a three-year-old was wandering around alone at night, you
would be worried.  
I left a note, but I should go home soon.  
  
"Mhm, going home."  
  
After answering, I put on the hood of my \[Hermit's Robe\].  
This should hide me from others—  
  
"L-Lady Reni!?"  
"Here."  
"Eh...? Eh...?"  
"I'm here."  
  
I guess from her perspective it looked like I had suddenly
disappeared.  
So, to reassure her, I squeezed her hand tightly.  
  
"The power of the item... the robe... my presence disappears."  
"Eh, eh...!"  
"Can you hear me?"  
"Yes! I can hear a very cute voice!"  
  
The elf girl blushed and nodded rapidly.  
Then, she continued, as if remembering something.  
  
"Lady Reni is also equipped with other very powerful items, isn't
she?"  
"Mhm."  
"Did you tell your mother about them?"  
"No."  
"....Where did you get those items?"  
"...I've had them since I was born."  
  
Yeah. When asked where I got the items, "I've had them since I was born"
is the only answer I can give. They're carryovers from the game I played
in my past life, after all.  
  
"...I understand."  
  
The elf girl looked stunned, then her face became serious.  
  
"Lady Reni truly is special."  
  
Determination filled her bright blue eyes.  
  
"I understand that Lady Reni has special powers and possesses wonderful
items. We can discuss those things later, but first, there's something
important."  
"Something important?"  
"Yes. Lady Reni is still small and is in the process of growing."  
"Mhm."  
  
I understand that very well.  
I've grown considerably from age 0 to 3, and I've even thought about how
amazing children's growth and development is. I can talk, walk, and now
I can run!  
  
"So, I would like you to try to live without relying too much on your
equipment."  
"...Not use items?"  
"No, of course, that doesn't mean you can't use them at all. Please use
them immediately when necessary. Please absolutely use them if Lady Reni
feels in danger."  
"Mhm."  
"However, using excessively powerful equipment could hinder Lady Reni's
physical growth. It's like your body starts slacking off…"  
"...Muscles won't grow?"  
"Exactly! Do you know about muscles? For Lady Reni to grow bigger, you
need muscles, and right now, instead of relying on equipment, you should
walk, run, and exercise a lot to build up your body."  
  
I nodded in agreement with the elf girl's words.  
Right now, with the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and \[Winged Rabbit Boots\]
equipped, my physical abilities are dramatically improved, and I don't
get tired at all.  
I thought it was a good thing, but considering I'm still a child and in
a growth spurt, getting used to this might not be good.  
For proper growth, I probably need to experience various things as a
normal toddler without equipment—lifting heavy things, running, and so
on.  
  
"Okay."  
  
I was completely convinced. It makes perfect sense.  
Instead of just saying "Don't use items" because I'm a three-year-old,
she explained the reason...and she carefully explained it in a way that
I could understand. My favorability with the elf girl has gone up.  
  
"Taking off equipment."  
  
I released the elf girl's hand and softly muttered, "item box." Then, I
put all the equipment except the \[Hermit's Robe\] back inside.  
  
"Taken off."  
"Eh... Ehh...? You already took them off? I didn't... I didn't notice
anything..."  
  
Since it was a good idea, I acted immediately, but because I did it
while my presence was hidden by the \[Hermit's Robe\], the elf girl
couldn't perceive it at all.  
Her eyebrows drooped.  
  
"Pathetic... I don't know anything about Lady Reni... No, it doesn't
matter what I feel right now. Lady Reni is special. She has amazing
abilities. That's... that's enough."  
  
The elf girl raised her eyebrows back to their normal position and then
made a fist with her right hand.  
I gently placed both my hands on that fist—  
  
"Reni, will walk hard."  
"Y-Yes!"  
"But, um..."  
"Yes?"  
"...I have a request."  
  
...Because I'm a three-year-old.  
Because I'm someone who spills \[Recovery Potions\] on my father, drops
\[Fertilizer\] in fields, and makes documents rain down...  
  
"I want to walk while holding hands."  
  
I think I might fall over...  
  
"Y-Yes! I-I, of course...!"  
  
At my words, the elf girl's cheeks flushed so red it was almost enough
to make another steaming noise.  
Then, she murmured as if she had just realized something.  
  
"Eh? Wait, eh? This warm, small thing touching my hand... eh? No way,
eh? This small, soft, overwhelmingly adorable thing that makes me feel
nothing but love is... Lady Reni's... hand?"  
  
After saying that, the elf girl suddenly stopped moving.  
I don't really understand, but my request to hold hands was granted.  
But, actually, I have one more request.  
I was worried I might be bothering her, so I took off the hood of the
\[Hermit's Robe\] so that we could have a face-to-face conversation.  
  
"Um..."  
"..."  
"If I get tired..."  
"..."  
"Will you carry me?"  
  
Of course, I intend to try my best until the end. If it absolutely
doesn't work, I can just equip my items.  
But, for the sake of growth and development, I want to use my body as
much as possible!  
I thought being carried would be more physically demanding than taking
it easy and relying on equipment…  
Maybe it's no good...? I peered into her bright blue eyes.  
Then, the elf girl—  
  
"Oh, it's impossible, too precious, too much, too much."  
  
She said that and then passed out with her eyes rolled back again.
