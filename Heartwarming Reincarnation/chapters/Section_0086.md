# Chapter 86・It’s an Original Magic Spell

After turning the men into stars, I approached the leather pouch
containing the money that fell to the ground.  
As expected, Samyu's archery skills are superb. The arrow didn't
puncture the pouch, but rather pierced the part where the top of the
pouch was tied.  
I pulled the arrow from the ground and picked up the leather pouch.  
Then, Samyu descended from the tree, and Hamu, who had been flying in
the air, also flew down beside me.  
  
"So what will happen? Those who managed this reservoir and extorted
money from the village are gone, but the reservoir remains as it is. The
water won't return to the lake."  
  
Hamu glanced at the reservoir filled with murky water.  
It's smaller than the lake, but still sizable. Bigger than a 25-meter
school swimming pool at an elementary school. And it's deep too.  
If this crudely made reservoir is left as it is, it’ll collapse, flow
down the mountain, and cause damage to the village.  
Since they’ll no longer be extorted for water, there's a possibility the
villagers could manage it themselves…  
  
"Remove the reservoir."  
  
When I said that, Samyu muttered while looking around the reservoir.  
  
"This reservoir seems to have been made by demolishing the original
mountain and digging it out. First, they dug downwards, hit an
underground water vein, and then expanded it horizontally."  
"Mhm."  
"Because the water vein isn't very far from the surface, they were able
to create this reservoir. …How did they know the water vein was so
shallow here…"  
"A normal person wouldn't know. Maybe it was luck, or something."  
  
Hamu furrowed her brow at Samyu's words and groaned, "Umu."  
  
"Young elf, even if you drain the water accumulated here, it will soon
overflow again. Even if you make the dug-out part the same as the
surrounding ground, it'll become just like a river."  
"That's… right. With Lady Reni's power, you could destroy this, but if
you do, the water will burst."  
  
Samyu also has a troubled look on her face.  
But I'm alright! I answered, puffing out my chest.  
  
"Reni, can do it. Watch."  
  
I slowly approached the reservoir.  
Then, I pointed my finger towards the water in the reservoir with my
cat’s paw. Not too much, not too much… Remembering my training with
Hasano in the Elven Forest…  
The warmth around my chest slowly gathered at my fingertip. This is the
feeling of mana flowing through the \[Mana Pathways\]. And then—  
  
"—Magic, \[Microwave\]"  
  
—A click and a wink.  
At that moment, the reservoir water boiled and instantly turned into
steam.  
  
"L-Lady Reni!?!"  
"Bwuh, hey, what the heck is this!!"  
  
Suddenly, steam rose, and something like a white cloud formed.  
Probably because it's hot, so don't touch it…  
  
"Cat's Claws!"  
  
I swiftly swung my right hand, generating a whirlwind. The steam was
caught in it and rose into the sky.  
  
"Okay."  
  
It worked! Just as I expected! I couldn't help but laugh out loud at how
well it went.  
Turning water into steam is my original magic, which I call
\[Microwave\]!  
As the name suggests, it works in the same way as a microwave oven,
moving water molecules around. This time, I used it directly on water,
boiling it and turning it into steam.  
When I was practicing \[Mana Manipulation\] with Hasano, I got so
absorbed that I let the warm tea she'd brought get cold. I tried using
this to warm it up, and it worked.  
In terms of mana, it consumes far less than the purification magic I
used on the \[Living Mail\], and Hasano said it'll be fine as long as I
don't use it too much.  
It's an original magic not found in the game.  
  
"Lady Reni, are you alright!? A Mana Rampage…!"  
"It's okay. It’s under control."  
  
Samy, looking flustered, embraced me as if to check my body. So I patted
her shoulder a few times to reassure her.  
  
"Still, watch."
