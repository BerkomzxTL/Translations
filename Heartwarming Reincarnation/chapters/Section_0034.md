# Chapter 34・We Ran Into an Incident As Soon as We Set Off!

Samyu and I somehow managed to survive the fall from the clock tower.  
The guardian contract was a success, and I can now use \[Telepathy\].  
My ears are round, and I'm sealed, but it seems my race is still
\[Elf\], after all.  
According to Samyu, who also survived the fall, I possess and circulate
mana, but its flow is sealed, and I can’t control it. My mother is in
the same state, yet her guardian contract with Samyu is still in effect,
which is why mine was also possible.  
  
I experimented to see what \[Telepathy\] would be like. It isn’t like
all my thoughts are transmitted, or that I can understand all of what
Samyu is thinking.  
It's more like only the thoughts I consciously send to Samyu reach her,
and in my imagination, it's close to a phone call.  
This ability is convenient because it allows us to communicate
regardless of distance.  
My mother and Samyu can also communicate, so if anything happens to my
parents, Samyu will know immediately. I’ll be able to travel with peace
of mind.  
With that being said…  
  
"Papa, Mama, I'm going!"  
  
Reni Shurm Guora. I've turned a magnificent four years old!  
Four years old! It's the season of departure!  
  
"Sleep well, eat plenty, and grow big and strong."  
"Mhm. Reni will get stronger."  
"That's my girl. I'm not worried about you, Reni."  
  
My family, having made many memories until my fourth birthday, greeted
the morning of my journey with smiles… but Papa was a little
teary-eyed.  
  
"Papa, please hold the doll properly."  
"I understand. Reni decorated the house with so many. It’ll be okay."  
"Mama, don't overwork yourself. If something difficult happens, please
tell Samyu immediately."  
"Yes. And Reni, tell Samyu if you have any troubles."  
"Mhm."  
  
Finally, I hugged my mother tightly, and she hugged me back.  
  
"Reni… be careful…!"  
  
Then my mother passed me to my father, who held me close.  
In the end, father was so overcome with emotion his voice cracked, but
he gently put me down.  
  
"Samyu… I’m counting on you."  
"Please, Samyu."  
"Yes. I will definitely protect her."  
  
The three adults exchanged glances over my head.  
They nodded firmly at each other, then Samyu took my hand.  
  
"Lady Reni. Let's go."  
"Mhm!"  
  
The weather is sunny.  
The breeze is pleasant and it's a beautiful day. Perfect weather for
setting off on a journey.  
  
"I'm off!"  
  
I waved to my parents.  
My mother smiled, and my father, despite his tears, also saw me off with
a smile.  
  
"What about the new mayor of Slanita?"  
"He's newly appointed. Since Shultem just disappeared, the appointment
was rushed, so it seems he won't be staying long. However, he seems to
be desperately trying to get things back on track."  
"I see."  
"Shultem embezzled a significant amount of public funds and collected
exorbitant taxes from neighboring areas. The new mayor is dealing with
the aftermath. The new mayor himself seems competent and doesn't appear
to be corrupt. I've deemed the situation stable."  
"Then, it's reassuring."  
  
As we walked along the road, I chatted with Samyu.  
We could use \[Telepathy\], but conversation is easier.  
There was an uproar following Shultem’s disappearance, but it seems the
new mayor is managing to get things done.  
This should give peace of mind to my father, mother, and the women I
helped.  
  
"However, the whereabouts of the children are still unknown. I apologize
for this; we had time before your departure, Lady Reni, but..."  
"Mmn. Thank you for investigating. I wonder where those children
went..."  
  
The children, gathered by Shultem along with the women, were sold off
somewhere.  
Shultem said it was to build connections with the higher-ups…  
  
"Samyu, where should we go first?"  
"Initially, I think we should go to the central city that governs this
village and surrounding areas."  
"The place where the city mayor is?"  
"Yes, Reoliga City. If there's a connection with Shultem, we might be
able to trace it from there."  
"Understood."  
  
I nodded at Samyu's words.  
Since Shultem wanted connections with higher-ups, it's certainly
reasonable to suspect the city mayor, who is above the town mayor.  
  
"I've already conducted some investigations, but Lady Reni’s direct
observation might reveal something new. Above all, it's the most
prosperous area in the region; it would be a nice sightseeing
opportunity for Lady Reni."  
"Mhm! I want to go!"  
"Reoliga City is a transportation hub, with many merchants passing
through. There are many inns and shops catering to travelers. I’m sure
Lady Reni will find something there to your liking."  
"Looking forward to it!"  
  
Having lived in the village my whole life, the only truly bustling place
I’ve seen is the town of Slanita.  
If there really are streets lined with stalls and shops like the ones in
the game, I absolutely want to see them with my own eyes! Samyu’s
description has gotten me incredibly excited!  
Our destination is Reoliga City, where the city mayor lives!  
  
"How far is it?"  
"It will take about three days to reach Reoliga. There are towns along
the way, so accommodations won't be a problem. If we need to hurry, I
can carry Lady Reni…"  
"Mmn, Reni will walk herself."  
  
Being carried by Samyu would be fast and easy, and we’d get there in no
time, but I need to build up my muscles.  
My abilities still have a negative modifier.  
  
"Right. Let's take our time. I’m sure there will be things Lady Reni
will enjoy along the way."  
"Mhm!"  
  
And so, three days into our journey.  
During the trip, we had fun eating delicious steaks at a restaurant
famous for its meat and stopping by a farm where we could pick fruit,
and the time flew by.  
According to Samyu, we should reach Reoliga City today.  
  
"The roads are wider, and there are more carriages."  
"Yes. It is a key transportation hub after all. Traffic is heavy."  
  
The road from my village where I was born to Slanita is unpaved, barely
wide enough for two people to pass. Now, there are wide, paved roads
where carriages can easily pass each other.  
While there aren't traffic jams of carriages, as soon as one passes,
another one goes by.  
It was clear just from this that Reoliga City is incredibly
prosperous.  
  
“…Samyu, that.”  
"What is it?"  
  
Another carriage passed us.  
As I watched it, it suddenly stopped, changed course, and headed back
towards us.  
  
"Hey! Run!"  
  
As we passed each other, the coachman called out to us.  
  
"Look south!! There's a dragon!!"
