# Chapter 29・We Need To Crush the Head

It was decided that when I turned four, I'd go on a journey with
Samyu.  
The purpose is to see the world and to search for jewels.  
Samyu went away from our house, saying she would investigate various
things for this purpose.  
In the meantime, I buried many charms to increase the defenses of the
house, and I lined up a large number of substitute dolls for my father
on a shelf.  
My father always carries a substitute doll with him since he started
hunting, but they disappear after a single use. So, I’m lining them up
so there will be replacements even after I’m gone.  
They're lined up one after the other on a small shelf that I can reach
even with my height. The corner is filled with a large number of wooden
dolls with creepy faces. It has a slightly arts and crafts exhibition
feel to it, but I hope people will appreciate them as part of the
decor.  
  
“Reni has a unique sensibility.”  
  
My mother laughed lightly.  
As expected of a 270-year-old. She doesn't mind her daughter arranging
creepy dolls. She has a different level of composure.  
  
“……Peace.”  
  
Two weeks have passed since Samyu left home, but nothing in particular
has happened.  
My parents don’t seem to be worried about their debts, and I was able to
get a shovel. My father's hunting is going well, and the harvest is
plentiful. I guess our economic situation has improved.  
My detection bell isn't ringing either.  
The debt collectors are no longer targeting our house.  
So, my family has been enjoying our time as a family, going on picnics
and shopping at the village tool shop.  
  
“Mama, give this to Papa.”  
“Okay. Reni really loves papa.”  
  
I pointed to the lined-up dolls and spoke to my mother, who is washing
the dishes. My mother wiped her hands with her apron and stroked my
head.  
As I savored the pleasant feeling, my mother tilted her head, saying,
“Oh?”  
  
“Reni, it seems Samyu is nearby. It looks like she has something to tell
you.”  
“! I’ll get ready!”  
  
Maybe she found something about Mayor Shultem.  
She said she would look into it, but I wonder what happened. Human
trafficking and secret ledgers. Were there other people besides my
mother who were sold? Will he continue to do so in the future?  
While I was sitting in my chair thinking about this, there was soon a
knock on the front door.  
I got off the chair, ran over to the front door, and spoke to the person
on the other side.  
  
“Samyu?”  
“Lady Reni!”  
  
Because I had been waiting for so long, it feels like it’s been much
longer than two weeks since I last saw her.  
I quickly opened the door, and Samyu slipped in through the gap and
knelt on one knee.  
  
“Lady Reni, it’s been a while. It’s been a while, Your Majesty.”  
  
After smiling at me, she bowed to Mama.  
My mother smiled and replied, “Yes.”  
  
"Lady Reni, I apologize for the delay, but I have come to report that
I've obtained a general overview of the matter in question."  
  
Samyu spoke to me in a low voice so my mother couldn't hear.  
I nodded, "Mhm," and squeezed Samyu's hand tightly.  
  
“Samyu, I’ve missed you so much.”  
  
Many times at night, I thought about going out to the mayor's place
alone.  
But Samyu said she would investigate, and I can’t go alone. I believed
that Samyu would investigate things that I wouldn’t be able to figure
out. I believed that, and waited.  
As I had hoped, Samyu came back with information.  
I’m glad I waited. I'm usually the type of person who can't hold back
and ends up acting on my feelings, but I'm glad I held back.  
So, I couldn’t help but grab Samyu’s hand.  
Ah, but Samyu…  
  
“……Gukuu”  
  
Her breathing is ragged. She’s breathing really hard.  
  
“Hang in there, hang in there… It's no good, if I collapse here I'll
look pathetic. Inhale, exhale... calm down."  
  
And while panting, she did her best to endure it.  
  
“……I’m sorry, Samyu.”  
  
Sensing that her eyes were in danger of rolling back, I quickly let go
of her hand.  
Samyu seemed to have regained her composure, relieved by my letting go
of her hand, and straightened her back.  
  
“I apologize. It’s not something one can easily endure without mental
preparation…”  
“Mmn…”  
“And, about the information, since Lady Reni doesn’t seem to want to
tell Her Majesty, I would like to discuss it outside if possible."  
“Let’s do that.”  
  
My mother is 270 years old, so she's brave, but she was the Elf Queen,
so she's unfamiliar with the ways of the human world. Furthermore,
having lived using magic for a long time, the fact that she's now able
to live a human life without magic is amazing.  
So, I don’t want to burden her too much.  
Of course, I intend to tell her important things, but I want my father
and mother to live peacefully.  
So, I told my mother that we were going for a walk, and Samyu and I
headed towards the entrance of the forest.  
Monsters live in the forest, so not many people come here.  
Only hunters like my father pass through occasionally, so there's no
need to worry about anyone overhearing our conversation.  
  
“Then Samyu, please.”  
“Yes.”  
  
I sat down on a conveniently placed stump and urged her to begin.  
I wanted Samyu to sit on the stump with me, but that wouldn’t work.
She'd have another hyperventilation episode…  
So, Samyu knelt on the forest undergrowth and continued.  
  
“I checked the ledger and documents Lady Reni obtained, and they
confirmed that Shultem is indeed behind it.”  
“Mhm.”  
“From the beginning, he would target women and lend them money through
Slanita Finance. When they were unable to repay, he would take the women
as collateral for the debt. He seems to have repeated this a lot.”  
“Mama was like that too.”  
“Because the Queen is beautiful…. There were several others in this
village who were in debt. Thanks to Lady Reni’s efforts, Slanita Finance
is gone, and he’s lost his limbs, but he might repeat the same thing
after some time passes.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
That’s right. Just because we destroyed Slanita Finance doesn’t mean we
can rest easy.  
Since Mayor Shultem is leading the operation, he just needs to gather
more people and repeat the same thing. No matter how many times you cut
off a lizard’s tail or eliminate the insects that come out, it’s
meaningless. You have to destroy the lizard's body and crush the parent
that produces the insects.  
  
“The women who were bought seem to still be working for Shultem. And—it
seems that young children are also being captured.”  
“Children too?”  
“Yes.”  
“However, it seems that the young children are not kept by Shultem and
are sold further.”  
  
I hummed and pondered Samyu's story.  
When I fought the debt collectors to get my IOU back, the debt
collectors tried to catch me and sell me. That burlap sack was just the
right size to hold a child, and maybe they had done this—caught children
and sold them—many times before.  
And, the leader of Slanita Finance said, ‘There are places that will pay
a high price for children like you.’ That means—  
  
“—The place they're sold to is a certain religious organization.”  
  
Samyu’s voice was lower than before.  
  
“It’s rumored that this place also has a jewel."  
  
The jewel that saved my mother.  
My father and Samyu stole it from a dragon in this world. In my past
life's game, I defeated a cave boss and got it from a hidden room.  
A separate religious organization rumored to possess a different jewel
is apparently buying up children.  
  
"...It could be a charity project, or they could just be raising young
children to increase their following."  
“Mhm.”  
  
Children are abducted, separated from their parents, and forced to
survive in an unfamiliar land.  
Well, it’s fine if they're able to live…  
  
“I haven't been able to investigate the religious organization yet. I
rushed here because I thought there might still be danger to Lady Reni
and Her Majesty if we leave things as they are.”  
“All right.”  
  
I nodded at Samyu’s words.  
I’m concerned about the religious group, but for now, I should deal with
what’s in front of me.  
  
“Samyu, will you come with me?”  
“Yes! I will accompany you!”  
“Papa, Mama, the current town is dangerous. I want to make it so we can
safely go to town."  
  
Before we leave, I want to do one last job so that my parents can go to
town without any danger.  
A peaceful home forever!  
  
“Leave it to Reni.”  
  
—Let’s go defeat Shultem!
