# Chapter 87・I’ll Level the Ground

"Y-Yes!"  
  
Samyu heard what I said and gently let go of me.  
I gave her a thumbs-up and went down to the bottom of the reservoir,
where it was all dry.  
  
"Safe!"  
  
Descending slowly and softly, the dried-up reservoir felt similar to the
dried-up \[Lake of Refreshing Rain\].  
The only difference is that water was springing up from the bottom on
the mountain side. There must have been a water vein here.  
The water vein wasn't dry yet and there’s plenty of water.  
  
"Let's do it!"  
  
I psyched myself up and opened my item box.  
I took out―  
  
"Dirt."  
  
Soil!  
  
"Dirt, dirt, dirt!"  
  
I pointed to a spot and a square piece of soil appeared with a \*pop\*.
Moving sideways, I started lining up the soil along the bottom of the
reservoir.  
It’s like in that one game. The kind where you place one block at a
time. The game had elements where you could build houses or farms on
land you'd set as your home.  
Thinking about it in terms of real blocks, it seems a little strange to
suddenly see a square piece of soil like this, but by filling it in
firmly from the edge, it should be fine.  
While I was working, someone called out—  
  
"What is this…?! Little elf, what are you doing?!"  
"Filling with dirt."  
"I can see that just by looking at it! That's not it! How are you taking
something out of nothing?! Moreover, that soil is 'as if it were freshly
cut from the ground'!"  
"Mhm. Just like that."  
  
Hamu descended to the bottom, touched the soil I had placed, and
exclaimed in surprise.  
Next came Samyu, who also touched a block of soil and cleared her
throat.  
  
"Lady Reni… is this related to when you made the underground passage to
Shultem's mansion?"  
"Mhm. This dirt… is from after digging with a pickaxe."  
"……At that time, I thought it was strange. If you dug a path
underground, there should definitely be leftover soil. Yet, there wasn't
any at all."  
"Reni had it."  
"Yes, that's it. …As expected of Lady Reni. You surpass my thinking and
fly to incredible heights in an instant."  
  
Ah, I remember making the underground passage to get to the basement of
Shultem's mansion when I was three years old. How nostalgic!  
The soil I just took out was the soil I had saved up in the game, so it
might not be the exact same soil from back then, but it's basically the
same. Each block of soil I dug was stored in my item box. And I can take
it out whenever I want like this.  
  
"Do you think this explanation will convince me?! You're not using earth
magic to break down the surrounding soil and filling it in, are you?!
This… it's as if it’ll be completely restored as if nothing ever
happened…"  
"Yes. Normally, to fill a dug pond, you have no choice but to fill it
with dirt brought from somewhere else. However, it's impossible to make
the same kind of land using the soil that was dug out. No matter how
much you compact it, it will become soft, wash away in the rain, water
will seep in, and the ground will end up lower than the surroundings,
eventually turning back into a pond."  
"But, what about the soil the young elf brought out… The firmness, the
quality. It's already blending in with the surrounding soil, as if it
were carved into this shape from the beginning…"  
"With this… the land that was dug up will be restored to its original
state."  
  
After the two were speechless, they looked at me.  
So, I nodded confidently.  
  
"Reni said Reni could do it."  
  
That's right! I will make the reservoir disappear as if it never
existed. And I will restore the lake without drying up the water vein or
changing its location.  
  
"I'm going to stop here."  
  
The place I pointed to was where the water was springing up. Placing
dirt there would block the flow of the water vein. So, here…  
  
"Cobblestone."  
  
I selected the item box and pointed, and a block paved with cobblestone
appeared with a \*pop\*.  
  
"What?! It's not just soil?!"  
"I have lots of materials."  
"I, I see… Water can't flow through soil. But since cobblestone has
gaps, the water can pass through it."  
"Mhm. I wish I could make it look nicer..."  
  
Originally, there might have been small cracks in the dirt or gaps
between large rocks. However, it’d be difficult to recreate it exactly
as it was at the beginning.  
So, thinking that it would be fine if the water vein leading to the lake
was restored, I decided to make a path out of cobblestone.  
  
"I’ll do the rest."  
  
I called out to Samyu and Hamu and continued working.  
I kept taking out soil and connecting cobblestone to the water veins
leading to the lake… Sometimes I made mistakes, so in those cases I
equipped my \[Pickaxe (Exceptional)\] to break up the soil.  
After connecting the water veins, I placed square blocks of soil up to
ground level—  
  
"Done!"  
  
—The reservoir is completely cleared!  
  
In the game, it was simple work of placing one block at a time, but
doing it in reality requires quite a bit of physical strength.  
After placing one block of soil, I had to move to the next, and when
going up a level, I had to climb up with all my might.  
I wiped the sweat from my brow with a feeling of accomplishment.  
  
"What kind of extraordinary ability is this…"  
"As expected of Lady Reni…! An amazing power…!"  
  
After touching the boundary between the original ground and the soil I
had placed, the two showed different expressions.  
Hamu looked dumbfounded. Samyu clasped her hands in front of her chest,
as if worshipping me.  
I nodded and said, "Mhm."  
  
"Now, we can fight."  
  
—Now, it's time to face the \[Water Serpent\]!
