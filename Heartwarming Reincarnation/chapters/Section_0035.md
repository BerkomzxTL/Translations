# Chapter 35・It Was a Carriage Under Attack

"Item box!"  
  
Hearing the driver's words as he passed, I quickly equipped myself. The
\[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and the \[Winged Rabbit Boots\]. With the
\[Hermit's Robe\] I was already wearing, and its hood up, I'm all set!  
  
"Samyu!"  
"Yes!"  
  
I called out to Samyu, kicked the ground with my \[Winged Rabbit
Boots\], and leaped towards where the carriage had U-turned.  
I landed on the top of a small hill. Looking south, I saw a sight that
hadn't been visible from where we had been walking.  
  
"It's under attack!"  
  
What I saw was a luxurious carriage and people who looked like soldiers
on horseback. The soldiers were surrounding the carriage, seemingly
trying to protect it. A dragon was attacking it.  
The dragon is about 10 meters tall. Its bronze scales gleaming, it has
thick legs and magnificent wings. Its total length, including its tail
and neck, make it even more imposing.  
The dragon landed on all four legs and swung its right foreleg, sending
a soldier and his horse flying.  
  
"That dragon was guarding the jewel… It’s supposed to be asleep in the
cave, but why…?"  
  
Samyu muttered in a daze.  
That's right. I’m also familiar with that dragon. It's the cave boss I
defeated in the game to obtain the jewel before my reincarnation. That's
this dragon.  
The jewel I obtained in the game, and the jewel that my father and Samyu
obtained for my mother, were linked by where they were obtained.
Therefore, the boss monster was probably the same as well.  
The Earth Dragon that was supposed to be sleeping in the cave. Why is it
out on the surface attacking a carriage—  
  
"Let's go!"  
"I'll back you up!"  
  
The dragon swung its left foreleg and whipped its spiked tail, sweeping
away the soldiers surrounding the carriage.  
All the soldiers were blown away by this attack.  
The dragon must have realized that the soldiers were gone. It let out a
guttural sound and fixed its rusty iron-colored eyes on the carriage.
The dragon grabbed it with its sharp-clawed right foreleg.  
The carriage it was putting pressure on started to creak—  
  
"Cat Punch!"  
"Guah!?"  
  
A part of the carriage was damaged, but I made it just in time!  
I used \[Flight (Jump)\] to instantly reach the dragon from the hill.
And then, a right straight!  
However, the dragon must have sensed my presence and dodged my \[Cat
Punch\] before it could land, leaping into the air. With my hood down I
should be invisible, but… hmm. Too bad.  
  
"Lady Reni! I'll distract the dragon for now!"  
"Mhm."  
  
Samyu, who had also come down from the hill to the carriage, nocked an
arrow on her bow and aimed at the dragon in the air.  
Samyu's blues eyes are sparkling, so she's probably using \[Mana
Manipulation\].  
The bow and arrow Samyu demonstrated in Slanita were incredibly
strong.  
However, is the dragon using mana as well? The arrow was deflected by
something like a barrier before it could hit.  
Samyu nocked another arrow and shot while moving away from the
carriage.  
  
*'Lady Reni. The dragon seems to be creating a barrier with mana and
deflecting the arrows. The arrows might not get through, but as long as
I keep firing, I don't think it will come down, so I'll continue.'*  
*'Mhm. Please. I’ll talk to the people in the carriage, then fight
too.'*  
*'Yes!'*  
  
Samyu's voice resonated directly in my head. It's \[Telepathy\].  
It's very helpful to be able to communicate like this even in places
where voices can't reach.  
As Samyu said, the dragon seemed bothered by the arrows and wasn't
attacking the carriage while flying in the air. The dragon's attention
was diverted from the carriage.  
So, I took that opportunity to approach the carriage and knock on the
door.  
  
"Are you alright?"  
"Y-Yes, I'm fine!"  
  
The voice that came back was still young. Maybe around my age?  
  
"Your Highness, please let us reply in your stead."  
"This is an emergency, you see."  
"But—"  
"Quiet. I want to talk. What's happening outside? Where are the
soldiers?"  
  
  
There seem to be several people inside the carriage, and I think all the
voices I heard were women.  
Among them, the first to respond was the one with a childish voice who
was referred to as 'Your Highness'. She seems willing to continue
communicating with me, so I explained the situation.  
  
"All the soldiers are down."  
"No way..."  
"A dragon attacked."  
"A dragon…?"  
  
The young voice trembled in fear. It's understandable that they would be
shocked to hear that all the soldiers were defeated and a dragon was
attacking. They probably haven't grasped what's happened until now.  
The carriage is made of wood with luxurious decorations, and the windows
are small. The window curtains are currently closed. The dragon must
have attacked suddenly, and they didn't have a chance to look outside.  
Because I could sense the people in the carriage were scared, I spoke in
as bright a voice as possible to reassure them.  
  
"Don't worry. Reni will take care of it."  
"Reni…? No, more than that, are you alright?"  
  
'Her Highness' seemed concerned about my safety.  
The crimson curtains with gold embroidery opened. A girl around my age
appeared.  
  
—Fluffy brown hair and suspicious brown eyes.  
—A beautiful dress that suited her perfectly.  
  
She must be someone of very high standing. That was clear from the title
of 'Your Highness,' the way she spoke, and her clothing.  
  
"Reni is strong."  
  
My figure should be hidden under the \[Hermit's Robe\] hood.  
So, to reassure her even though she can't see me, I replied again in a
bright voice.  
The girl seemed puzzled that she couldn't see me and looked around
nervously.  
  
"Where are you?"  
"Stay there, it's dangerous."  
  
I can't reveal myself right now.  
So, I told her to stay in the carriage and turned my attention to the
dragon.  
Samyu was still shooting arrows, and the dragon was irritably deflecting
them with its magical barrier.  
  
*'Samyu, I'm going in now!'*  
*'Yes, I'll support you!'*  
  
After communicating with Samyu in my head, I planted my feet firmly on
the ground.  
  
"Jump!"  
  
I put all my strength into it, and my body leaped into the air.  
Then, toward the dragon in the air, another right straight!  
  
"Cat Punch!"  
"Ngua!"  
"Ah…"  
  
Despite putting all my force into my right hand, the dragon sensed my
presence again and avoided it by flying to the left.  
  
*'Lady Reni!? Are you falling right now!?'*  
*'…Mhm, I lost my balance.'*  
*'I'll catch you!'*  
  
Thanks to the power of the \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], I didn't fall
straight down, but because my posture was disrupted in mid-air, I ended
up falling back-first to the ground.  
I don't know how she sensed my position even though she couldn't see me,
but Samyu used \[Telepathy\] to quickly lend support.  
I imagine it's difficult to catch me since she couldn't see me, but
Samyu quickly positioned herself at my landing point and caught me.  
  
"Lady Reni!"  
"Samyu, thank you. You're amazing, even though you can’t see Reni."  
"No way! Lady Reni's love is not something you can see with your eyes,
but something you feel with your heart!"  
"……Mmn."  
  
…I don't quite understand.  
  
"I'm sorry. If only my arrows could hit it…"  
"Mhm. I wish my punch would land."  
  
That's right. If only my punch would land.  
But with the \[Winged Rabbit Boots\], I can only repeatedly jump from
the ground and then fall, so I'm at a disadvantage against a dragon that
can freely change its trajectory in the air.  
Even though I can't be seen, it's sensing my presence? The flow of air?
I don't really know, but it can sense me and skillfully avoid the
attacks.  
  
"Lady Reni, I'll shoot again. I'll do my best to keep the dragon in
place as long as possible…!"  
"Mhm. I'll think about a way to land my punch."  
"Yes!"  
  
Samyu put me down on the ground and immediately nocked another arrow,
firing it.  
Then, before the arrow reached the dragon, she moved and shot from
another position.  
Apparently, instead of shooting from the same position, she's shooting
from various directions to hold the dragon back.  
If I time it with Samyu, I might be able to land a punch more easily
than before.  
But—  
  
"It can escape from above and below."  
  
In the air, unlike on the ground, it can dodge not only forward,
backward, left, and right, but also up and down.  
I'm confident I could win if I could just land one hit, but if it avoids
it, there’s no point.  
  
"……If only I could jump again in mid-air…"  
  
—If I could kick the air to change my trajectory before landing.  
  
"—I can."  
  
I've never done it before.  
Kicking air is practically impossible according to the laws of
physics.  
There wasn't such a system in the game either.  
But still—  
  
"I can. I definitely can."  
  
If it’s the strongest four-year-old, Reni Shurm Guora.  
  
"A double jump is easy for me."  
  
Right?  
  
*'Samyu, I'm attacking now. Hold the dragon in place.'*  
*'Leave it to me!'*  
  
Samyu fired an arrow, and the dragon, unable to escape forward,
backward, left, or right, was trapped. Looking up at its bronze-colored,
gigantic body, I clenched my fist tightly.  
  
"Jump!"  
  
I kicked the ground, timing it with Samyu's arrows.  
To collide head-on with the dragon stuck in the air.  
The dragon, unable to flee forward, backward, left, or right because of
Samyu's arrows, sensing that I'm coming straight at it, flew straight up
to avoid my trajectory.  
  
"That's what I thought."  
  
A smile escaped my lips.  
This way, I'll just pass under the dragon.  
The dragon also seems to be more wary of Samyu than me, who's only
jumping around, and doesn't even try to look at me. Well, maybe it's
because it can't see me.  
But that carelessness will be its undoing!  
  
"Here!"  
  
Right under the dragon.  
So I put a lot of strength into my right foot.  
—My chest feels warm.  
A warmth is welling up from my chest. I've never felt this before, but
it doesn't feel bad.  
So, I gathered that heat in my chest into my right foot—  
  
"—Double Jump!"  
  
I definitely felt something—something to kick off of—in the air where my
right foot should have cut through the emptiness.  
I kicked that with all my might.  
Then, my body shot straight up.  
  
"Cat Punch!"  
  
The dragon's rusty iron-colored eyes met mine.  
Ah, maybe my hood came off.  
But it's probably too late to react to me now.  
I thrust my folded right hand straight up.  
I pushed up against the dragon's lower abdomen, putting all my momentum
and strength into my right hand!  
  
"Become a constellation!"  
"Gwaaaaaaggwwwwww!!"  
  
—Twinkle  
  
The dragon became a constellation!
