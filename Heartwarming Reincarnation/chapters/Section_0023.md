# Chapter 23・Deep Breaths Are Important

The elf girl, eyes wide, collapsed. A few seconds later, she returned to
her original kneeling position.  
  
"I apologize. I lost my composure."  
"……Mhm."  
"It's okay. I simply forgot to breathe."  
  
……Forgot to breathe?  
  
"Then, Lady Reni, let us proceed. …With all due respect… I, I will touch
your hand."  
"Please."  
  
I placed my hand in the one she respectfully offered to me. The elf girl
then let out a small groan and closed her eyes.  
  
"Come on. Come on, me. Calm down…inhale, exhale. That's right, deep
breaths…yes,…deep brea…th…."  
  
She's desperately trying to take a deep breath, but her breathing is
already ragged on the second attempt. This is probably a no-go.  
Realizing this, I lowered the hood of my robe with my free hand.  
  
"How's this?"  
  
I called out, and the elf girl opened her eyes.  
With the hood of my \[Hermit's Robe\] up, I'm hidden from view.  
  
"Lady Reni's form has become invisible again… Is it the effect of your
equipment, as before?"  
"Mhm. Is this okay?"  
"……Yes. Seeing Lady Reni's form while touching your hand was apparently
too much for me."  
  
The elf girl slumped her shoulders dejectedly.  
But for now, her breathing seems to have returned to normal.  
  
"I caused Lady Reni trouble, but even putting my situation aside, I
think it would be best if Lady Reni wasn't seen, so let's go home in
this state."  
"Mhm."  
"Then, let's get going."  
"Okay."  
  
The elf girl waited for my response before quietly starting to walk.
Following her, I also started to walk steadily forward.  
  
"How are we going back?"  
  
We left the newly renovated Slanita Finance building, which now has no
roof and no occupants, and exited onto the street. To leave the town, we
need to pass through the gate, but will the elf girl even be allowed
outside at night?  
I was curious so I asked her, and the elf girl nodded, saying it's
alright.  
  
"I scaled the wall to enter this town, so I intend to climb over it
again to leave."  
"Eh? Not the gate?"  
"Yes. If I could make myself invisible like Lady Reni, that would be
ideal, but I lack that ability…"  
"Over the wall?"  
"Yes."  
  
The elf girl nonchalantly answered my question.  
But, the wall was built to guard against monster attacks, so it’s quite
high and seems difficult to climb.  
While wondering about it, I followed her hand, and she stopped before a
wall that looked to be at least 5 meters high.  
  
"Let's climb."  
  
No, that's impossible, isn't it?  
  
"It's really high!"  
"Lady Reni. Lady Reni, do you know what the elves are called among the
common folk?"  
"Um… forest sages?"  
  
Sages of the Forest. I think the elves in the game were called that.  
  
"Yes, that's right. Elves rarely interact with humans and live in deep
forests. Many are skilled in manipulating mana. They have long
lifespans, and possess a wealth of knowledge. They are called that
because they live their lives at a leisurely pace."  
  
That was the case in the game, too. Elves didn't live in human
settlements, creating their own villages in the Primal Forest, a place
with an incredible number of huge trees. They were strong in magic, but
more focused on healing than attack magic, and were also knowledgeable
about herbs and history.  
I chose the elf race, but mainly spent my time doing item synthesis…  
While I nodded, remembering that, the girl laughed softly.  
  
"But there's another name."  
  
Her smiling face was adorable as she said this…  
  
"Forest hunters."  
"Forest… hunters?"  
"I'll show you the meaning behind that name… so, um... may I pick you
up?"  
"Of course!"  
  
Excited by the suggestion, I quickly placed my hands on both of the elf
girl's upper arms. Yep, it's a hug pose. Even if my form isn't visible,
this should give her some idea of where my body is.  
The elf girl, seemingly able to guess my position from my touch, grasped
my waist and lifted me up.  
  
"…This…is Lady Reni's weight…I only feel love…It's hard, too much… but
no, stay calm, calm down, I…if I fall now, Lady Reni will be caught up
in it, too. I absolutely must avoid that… come on, me. Inhale, exhale…
inhale…"  
"Are you alright?"  
"Ngh."  
  
Although she held me in her arms, the elf girl kept taking deep breaths
so I gently called out to her.  
Then, the elf girl stopped abruptly.  
  
"Voice…by my ear."  
  
And then, her knees trembled, her ragged breathing indicating an
imminent collapse—  
  
"No…I…cannot…fall!!"  
  
—The tension of a final boss.  
  
This is no time to be talking!
