# Chapter 26・My Child Is a Genius 3

After Reni returned to the village.  
The couple returned home with Reni and Samyu.  
It was late at night, and long past time for their child, Reni, to go to
sleep. The couple thought they should get Reni to sleep quickly, but
they had something to tell her first.  
They were certain of it.  
Reni is only three years old, but they believed she could understand and
choose her own path.  
  
"Reni, you might be sleepy, but could we talk for a little while?"  
"Mhm. I’m okay."  
  
A four-person dining table  
Usually, it was just the couple, but today, it included Reni and Samyu,
making four. Since there were only three chairs, the couple decided to
hold Reni on their lap.  
Reni didn't seem to mind and quietly settled onto her mother's lap.  
After confirming she was calm, the mother slowly began to speak.  
  
"So, what did you think when Mama said she's the Elf Queen?"  
"I thought it was amazing. …But why are mama’s ears round?"  
"Right…"  
  
Reni tilted her head.  
Yes, if she were an elf, her ears should have been pointed.  
  
"Reni, do you know how elves are different from humans?"  
"Mhm. Samyu told me. About mana."  
  
Reni nodded at her mother's words.  
Earlier, Samyu had explained that elves had mana circulating within
their bodies and could manipulate it. This allowed them to use magic,
enhance their physical abilities, and live longer.  
  
"Mama's mana, you see…well, I can't use it properly anymore."  
"Is that dangerous?"  
"Mama… was supposed to die just like that."  
  
A pained smile.  
It was different from the mother's usual bright smile. Reni's eyes
wandered slightly before she hugged her mother tightly.  
Seeing this, Samyu took over.  
  
"Elves who have lost their ability to manipulate mana have existed
before. As far as the records show, there have been three…and they all
died shortly after."  
"When mama found out, I thought it was inevitable. I didn't have much
time left, but I wanted to do what I wanted to do."  
"Mhm."  
"Then, Papa was injured and collapsed in front of the Elven Forest."  
"Papa?"  
"…A monster was a bit too strong."  
  
Under Reni's gaze, the father scratched his cheek sheepishly.  
  
"Humans aren't allowed in the Elven Forest, but Mama really wanted to
help… Seeing my own short life I couldn’t do anything about, and a life
I could somehow save, I just wanted to save Papa."  
"I've always been lucky. Getting injured by the monster wasn't good, but
thanks to that I now have the best wife."  
  
The husband's chuckle elicited a happy "Oh my" from his wife.  
It was a heartwarming scene, but Samyu made a face as if she were
chewing on a bitter insect.  
  
"This human… because of this human…"  
  
Samyu gritted her teeth.  
  
"We elves were aware that the Queen saved a human. But, given the
Queen's short lifespan, we couldn't exactly throw her out of the forest.
…As a result, the relationship between the Queen and the human became
increasingly deep."  
  
Hearing Samyu's words, Reni looked at the three faces.  
The father's shy smile, the mother's happiness…and Samyu glaring at the
father with resentment.  
This must have been the state of the Elven Forest at the time.  
  
"…We had given up. But this human didn't give up."  
"It was a long-standing rumor among us adventurers. In this world,
there's a divine treasure called the \[Jewel\]. There were various
rumors about religious organizations possessing it, or a certain kingdom
having it, but I got information that a dragon possessed it."  
"Jewel…"  
"Papa and Samyu got the \[Jewel\] from a dragon to save Mama."  
"Ah. There was a dragon in the cave. Samyu fought it while I went into
the hidden room. I was really lucky."  
"This human is truly lucky. How did he find such a place?"  
  
Reni blinked at the conversation.  
She had a memory of this.  
  
—Before Reincarnation.  
  
Reni, as a high school girl, obtained an item in a game.  
She defeated the dragon, the boss of the cave, and entered a hidden
passage.  
And what she found there was the \[Jewel (Legendary)\].  
  
"It's said that seven Jewels support this world… Papa and Samyu found
one of them."  
"The Jewel is said to grant wishes. I thought it would cure my body."  
"If it could save the Queen."  
  
A human man and Samyu, the elf, who didn't get along.  
They could cooperate because they shared the same goal.  
Responding to their feelings, the Elf Queen chose—  
  
"—To become a human."  
  
—To become human.  
  
"If I became human, the mana would disappear from my body, and I
wouldn't need to manipulate it anymore."  
"I… I thought you were going to wish on the Jewel to ‘regain the ability
to manipulate mana’! That way, you could have remained a strong and
long-lived elf…!"  
"I wanted to live with him as a human."  
  
Yes. The Elf Queen chose a humble human man. To live together, she gave
up everything and became human.  
  
"…As a result, the Queen lost the mana in her body, and her appearance
became that of a human. …We elves didn't mind as long as the Queen's
life was saved. —But the Queen ran away from the Elven Forest. With this
human man."  
"Because you would have immediately tried to separate us, right?"  
"...That’s right."  
  
Elves had strong bonds within their race but were exclusive to other
races. The Queen's transformation into a human only intensified the
elves' loathing toward the human man.  
In the Elven Forest, the elves would keep the Queen and banish the human
man. That was the elves' decision.  
  
"Papa, are you a wanted man?"  
"Yes. I kidnapped the Elf Queen."  
"You're the object of all the elves' hostility."  
"Hey."  
"It's the truth."  
  
Samyu declared with a resentful expression.  
Then, the wife laughed, "Oh my."  
  
"Then I'm the enemy of the world. I used one of the Jewels that support
the world for my own selfish desires."  
"Such… such a thing…"  
"That's why we decided to live quietly. Just the two of us,
peacefully."  
"It was tough at first, but we got used to it quickly."  
  
It was difficult for the wife, who had lived a life dependent on mana as
the Queen of the Elves, to adapt to human life. However, with her
husband's support, she began her life as a human.  
  
"I was surprised when I found out I was pregnant."  
"Yes. Elves should only be able to have children with other elves… When
Reni was born, I was relieved. She had round ears, a normal human girl.
Children can't be born between elves and humans. So I guessed I really
had become human."  
  
Seeing Reni, the couple chose to continue their life.  
The husband went hunting, and the wife took care of the child while
working in the field.  
  
"But Reni had a lot of strange powers."  
  
From the moment she was born, the couple wondered if Reni might not be a
human child.  
She was incredibly easy to care for. There was a gleam of reason in her
eyes.  
  
"Not knowing what to do, we decided to hide it. …We were afraid that the
elves would come to take her back or that humans would drive us out."  
"And I immediately got injured and sick…"  
  
Their stable life began to crumble.  
  
"But Reni always helped us."  
"Yeah. If Reni wasn't our daughter, we wouldn't have overcome so many
things. I guess we're really lucky that Reni is our daughter."  
  
For the couple, Reni being their daughter has always been a salvation.  
  
"Reni, thank you."  
"You worked hard today too, didn't you? Thank you."  
  
The couple smiled at Reni.  
Reni looked at their faces...and murmured.  
  
"...Reni is, probably not normal."  
  
Reni has memories from her previous life.  
She remembered this world as a game, and her level was already maxed
out, and she had brought over a large number of items.  
  
"Strange, right?"  
  
And that's not all...  
In her previous life, Reni couldn't fit into society well.  
*'It's because I'm weird.'*  
Reni had always felt that way, and even now she was well aware that
something was wrong with her.  
  
"But… you still raised weird Reni."  
  
The father, who, no matter how many times got soaked to the bone, would
hug her and say, "You're so cute, you're so cute."  
The mother, who would laugh, "Oh my, oh my," and let her do as she
pleased, even when Reni was doing strange things on her own.  
  
"Papa."  
  
The same golden eyes as Reni.  
  
"Mama."  
  
The same silver hair as Reni.  
  
"Love you."  
  
She hugged her mother tightly.  
Then, the father stood up from the chair, and the three of them hugged
tightly.  
  
"Mama loves Reni too."  
"So does Papa. Papa loves Reni."  
  
No matter who Reni was. Even if they didn't look alike.  
The time they spent together, these overflowing feelings in their
hearts, proved that these three were a family—  
  
"Reni wants to travel."  
  
She would bear the burden of being chased by elves and driven out by
humans.  
  
"I want to see the world."  
  
Straight golden eyes.  
Her silver hair swayed gently, a cute girl who captivated everyone.  
Because they wanted those sparkling eyes to continue shining—  
  
"Yes. Go ahead."  
"We'll always be waiting here for you."  
  
—The couple decided to let their daughter leave on her journey.
