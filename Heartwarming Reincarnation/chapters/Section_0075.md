# Chapter 75・Dragon’s Boneless Ham

"Mm!? Hmm!? Hmmmm!?"  
  
It seems my voice reached the dragon girl, who arched her back
dramatically in mid-air, a truly impressive backward bend… I wonder if
she's okay.  
Then, straightening up from her backbend, the dragon girl pointed
sharply at me.  
  
“You there, little elf!”  
“Reni?”  
“Yes, you! …Say it again!”  
“Again?”  
“What you said just now! Come on! Come on! Say it!”  
  
The dragon girl fidgeted, clearly wanting something from me.  
What I said just now… let’s see…  
  
“Cool?”  
“Nngh!!”  
“Is that okay?”  
“Again! Again!! No, not just again, as many times as you like! Tell me
all the things you find charming about me!”  
“Cool.”  
“Mhmm!”  
“The black parts are cool.”  
“Ngh.”  
“Being able to fly is cool.”  
“Mmm.”  
“Reni, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\], happy to see you.”  
“MMMNN.”  
  
Every time I spoke, the dragon girl arched her back.  
Finally, she descended in front of me and struck a pose, declaring,
“How’s that?!”  
That moment—  
  
“Well done, Reni!”  
  
—Four rings of light enveloped the dragon girl.  
It was kind of like ring toss.  
The dragon girl, who had been striking a pose in front of me, couldn't
avoid them. The rings of light stopped at her shoulders, under her
chest, her stomach, and above her knees, then tightened, binding her
tightly...  
  
“Wh…what is this…? Ugh”  
  
The dragon girl, now resembling a boneless ham, rolled onto the ground.
She fell onto her cheek, but I wonder if she's okay...  
  
“Ugh, what is this…? I can’t get it off!”  
“Yes. Even \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] can’t break free from the Elf
Queen's full-power magic. It won’t come undone easily.”  
  
Hasano chuckled, looking at the dragon girl wiggling around.  
Apparently, the rings of light were her doing. They resembled the rings
of light from when she used \[Mana Appraisal\], but it seems they have
other uses as well.  
I let out a breath, impressed by Hasano’s resourcefulness. Just as Samyu
had said, Hasano is very skilled at using magic.  
Then, the dragon girl glared up at me.  
  
“Y-you tricked me…!”  
“Tricked you?”  
“You said I was cool! You toyed with my pure heart, you deceiver!”  
  
Her purple eyes were distorted with frustration.  
But I—  
  
“Reni didn’t lie”  
“But…!”  
“I thought you were cool. I still think so.”  
“Mmmph!! ”  
  
The dragon girl, still struggling, arched her back again… She’s full of
energy.  
Samyu looked down at her coldly.  
  
“There's no way Lady Reni would deceive anyone. Lady Reni truly meant
it, and merely voiced her thoughts. You're just stupid."  
"You really are a terrible elf!"  
“Being terrible is fine. More importantly, extinguish your flames
quickly. If you keep going like this, you'll be reduced to ashes as
well."  
“Yes. I have no intention of letting you go.”  
  
Samyu and Hasano approached the dragon girl, wriggling on the ground.  
Defeated by their stern expressions, the dragon girl stopped moving.  
  
“…It’s impossible”  
“Huh?”  
  
Ah… Samyu, such a harsh voice…  
  
“…My breath is the strongest. It won’t go out until it’s consumed its
target.”  
“Huh?”  
“…My breath is strong.”  
“Alright. Let’s turn this dragon into ashes.”  
  
Saying that, Samyu lost interest and looked away from the dragon girl.  
  
“No, no! It’s me!? I’m the Black Dragon of the World’s Foundation!? If I
disappear, this world will be in trouble!?”  
“It can’t be helped.”  
“There’s no such thing as ‘can’t be helped’!!”  
  
As the dragon girl began wriggling again, Hasano sighed.  
  
“To think she’d use a power she couldn't control… Anyway, let's proceed
as planned and aim for a single breakthrough.”  
“Yes!”  
“Reni, come over here—”  
  
Hasano beckoned me.  
But I answered confidently.  
  
“Reni can do it.”  
  
The elves had talked about it. The flames burning the forest have a
strange power, and can only be extinguished by magic.  
Even if \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] herself couldn't extinguish it, I
can!  
  
“Leave it to Reni!”  
  
Because, in other words…  
—Magic can extinguish it.  
  
“So it’s you…”  
  
I held both hands over my chest. Then, I saw a sparkling jewel appear.  
This feeling was the same as when I purified the \[Living Mail\] in
Reoliga.  
My \[Mana Pathways\] had become narrower, but the image of using magic
through the jewel remained largely unchanged.  
My body was getting hot. Spreading this heat to the ground…  
  
“Protect the Elven Forest, extinguish the flames.”  
  
The range encompassed the entire Elven Forest.  
  
“Become light!”  
  
The moment I spoke, light surged from the ground.  
This should be fine. The Elven Forest won't burn, and everyone will be
safe and sound.  
Truly the strongest four-year-old!  
That’s what I thought, but—  
  
“Reni, no…!!”  
  
Beyond the light, Hasano was desperately reaching out.
