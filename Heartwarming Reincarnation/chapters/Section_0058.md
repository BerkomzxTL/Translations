# Chapter 58・Heading to the Capital

"Pio, can you keep up?"  
"Yes. But I might be reaching my limit."  
  
What should we do about Pio? Samyu and I can continue as we are,
but...  
The horse seems exhausted, breathing heavily.  
  
"Item Box"  
  
I'll choose items for the horse.  
First, health recovery. And then, we need ability upgrades, right?  
  
"Confirm."  
  
I took out a \[Recovery Potion (Special)\] and \[Swift Hooves\].  
The horse immediately recovered its energy after drinking the potion.
Its breathing normalized, its coat shone, and its eyes sparkled.  
\[Swift Hooves\] are equipment for riding animals, increasing movement
speed.  
I thought it might be difficult to adjust the size, but, as expected of
my items, it fit perfectly.  
Pio said that a knight must also be able to care for their horse, and
skillfully attached them.  
  
"Amazing. Even though Juliana was already a wonderful horse, her speed
has increased dramatically."  
  
Pio, after a short test ride on the revitalized horse, let out a gasp of
admiration.  
Juliana must be the horse's name. I think it's a beautiful white
horse.  
With this, she should be able to keep up with Samyu and me.  
  
"Let's go then."  
"Yes. This way."  
  
Following Pio's guidance, we hurried to the scene of the attack by the
Living Mail.  
The group, who was supposed to be heading to the lodging town, had
strayed north of the proper path.  
If Pio hadn't met us, Samyu and I might have passed right by.  
Just like when they were attacked by the dragon, I gave everyone
recovery potions.  
There were a lot more this time, making it quite a task, but that's
okay. My item inventory is maxed out!  
Therefore...  
  
"Everyone's healthy!"  
"““Hooray!””"  
  
Everyone cheered, relieved.  
It's good that everyone is safe again.  
  
"Lady Reni, thank you so much…!"  
"Please, Her Highness…!"  
"Please save Her Highness…!"  
  
Carrie’s three maids, who had fainted in the wrecked carriage.  
Everyone was fine, but the three of them showed anxiety and distress
over Carrie's absence.  
Mhm. This isn't the end.  
We must go and rescue Carrie.  
I nodded to the three maids, "Understood."  
Then, Samyu, who had been gathering information, and Pio, who had been
giving instructions to her subordinates, returned.  
And the two announced—  
  
"Lady Reni. A soldier who was barely conscious during the attack is
still alive. We spoke with him."  
"Yes. I also heard from him. The culprit is..."  
  
—The culprit's name.  
  
"Gaillard."  
"Gaillard."  
  
The name both gave was Gaillard. The Count, lord of the Gaillard
Domain.  
The documents we found in the basement of the village we rescued
mentioned him as the bishop of the cult.  
  
"I failed."  
  
I had planned to have Count Gaillard, Pio, and the guards protect Carrie
while I took out the source of the attacks on the children and Carrie.  
But, if Count Gaillard was the source, I should have stayed with
Carrie.  
  
"It… didn't ring."  
  
When I met Count Gaillard at the tea party, the \[Detection Bell\]
didn't ring. That must have been because Count Gaillard didn't intend to
attack me.  
Afterward, I gave Carrie the \[Detection Bell\], but what happened to
that?  
  
"Is the bell the one Lady Reni gave Her Highness?"  
"Mhm. It should have rung if there was danger. Didn't it ring when Count
Gaillard was around?"  
  
Even though we were together at Mayor Thomas's mansion for a week, I
wasn't with Carrie every second.  
I’m sure Pio and the three maids know more about that, so I asked.  
Then Pio put a hand to her chin, and the three maids exchanged glances
before answering.  
  
"After Lady Reni gave her the bell, Gaillard left the mansion
immediately, so I don't think Her Highness and Gaillard were ever
together."  
"Yes. And Her Highness treasured the bell Lady Reni gave her, keeping it
in a treasure chest."  
"She had asked a merchant introduced by Mayor Thomas to have it worked
on."  
"Lady Reni said, 'So you can rest comfortably,' so she seemed to have it
with her often at night."  
"I see..."  
"We suffered a major defeat this time, but Her Highness was the first to
notice the attack. The bell was ringing, so she warned everyone to be
careful."  
"Mhm."  
"Thanks to that, we were able to avoid the surprise attack and somehow
no one was killed."  
  
After listening to Pio and the three maids, I let out a sigh.  
I wanted to protect her properly, but things don’t always work out that
way.  
Still, I’d like to think I managed the bare minimum, I hope...  
  
"Let's rescue Carrie quickly."  
  
Carrie has disappeared.  
Count Gaillard must have taken her.  
She must be scared all alone.  
  
"We have to hurry…"  
  
Saying this, I took a step forward.  
However, my body swayed unsteadily—  
  
"Lady Reni!"  
  
Samyu, who was next to me, quickly supported me.  
I tried to regain my composure, but I couldn't get my body to move
properly.  
  
"Lady Reni…"  
"Is something wrong with your health?"  
"No good, this way!"  
  
The three maids tried to find a place for me to rest.  
I shook my head.  
  
"I'm just sleepy…"  
  
Yes. So it's alright.  
Actually, I've been sleepy for a while now.  
Even with the equipment, I'm not unaffected by fatigue. It's already
past the time a four-year-old should be awake.  
Before my reincarnation, I could easily stay up all night, but now it's
a bit much…  
But, now isn't the time to be sleeping.  
  
"Recovery potion…drink."  
  
The sleepiness was almost the same as when I took the sleeping pill. I
somehow barely managed to stop my eyes from closing as I responded.  
If this sleepiness is a status ailment, then a recovery potion should
cure it.  
That's what I said, but—  
  
"That's not a good idea, Reni."  
  
Pio stopped me.  
  
"Everyone was saved by you, Reni. Even though it's not my place to say
it, since I asked you to rescue Her Highness, it's too much of a burden
for you. Her Highness will scold you later."  
"That's right. Lady Reni is still growing. It's natural to feel sleepy,
it's for your health. I think getting proper sleep is better than
solving it with items."  
  
Samyu agreed with Pio.  
Samyu always tells me that overusing items hinders growth. Her words
this time were also reasonable.  
  
"But…"  
  
But I want to chase after Carrie quickly.  
So when I hesitated to nod, Pio nodded and said, "I understand."  
  
"Reni. Do you have another set of the horseshoes you gave to Juliana?"  
"Yes, I do…"  
"Then, please allow me to attach them to another horse. How about
traveling by carriage?"  
"Carriage…?"  
"Yes. If you're in a carriage, you can rest, and we can still move, so
rescuing Her Highness won't be delayed. If you put your horseshoes on
it, we'll be fast. I'll prepare the best carriage I can, so let's go in
that."  
  
I listened to Pio, and tried to think with my fogged brain.  
I feel bad for the horses that would have to ride all night, but it
seems like the best option.  
  
"Please…"  
"Yes. I'll make the arrangements. You all should prepare the inside of
the carriage so Reni can rest."  
"““Yes!””"  
  
I handed Pio another set of \[Swift Hooves\].  
Pio received them and gave instructions to the three maids, then quickly
left. It seems like she's talking to a soldier, so she'll take care of
things.  
I can barely stand anymore—  
  
"Lady Reni, excuse me."  
  
After making sure there was no one nearby, Samyu pulled my hood over
me.  
This should hide my appearance.  
Then, she gently hugged me.  
Samyu's warm body and reassuring hands.  
  
"Thank you… Samyu."  
"Yes. Please rest well."  
  
I lost consciousness.
