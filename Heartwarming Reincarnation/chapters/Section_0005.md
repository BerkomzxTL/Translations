# Chapter 5・I Used Fertilizer on the Field

I moved to the field and checked what was currently planted. There were
various vegetables, but it seemed that they were mainly grown for
eating. When I was playing the game, a field was just a place to gather
materials, so seeing only vegetables planted here feels strange.  
Currently, potatoes and some leafy greens are planted, with a small
empty space in the right corner. For now, I think it would be best to
put fertilizer there and spread it around.  
  
"Aitemu bok shu."  
  
Item box!  
With my words, many item names appeared before my eyes. From among them,
I chose \[Fertilizer (Legendary)\] with my gaze.  
  
"That one!"  
  
With my selection, the item box disappeared, and I felt a heavy weight
in my hand. Proof that the fertilizer had appeared. I tried to catch
it—  
  
"H, heavy…"  
  
Zooshaa!  
  
It was too heavy to hold, and the bag fell to the ground…  
— spilling its contents everywhere.  
  
“…Fuwaa.”  
  
Is this… is this despair?  
There was so much fertilizer that it would have been enough to spread
across the entire field, yet I used it all up in this tiny corner.  
And, as expected of \[Fertilizer (Legendary)\], it was quickly absorbed,
disappearing into the soil in an instant. Not a trace was left behind.
All that remained was a remarkably fertile, moist, and fluffy 30cm x
30cm patch of earth.  
  
"…Won't give up."  
  
That's right. I'm not giving up. This kind of thing is commonplace in
games. I can't give up after one failure; the main story won't progress.
If there's a boss I can't defeat, I just level up and try again.  
Besides, I can formulate a new plan based on this result.  
  
"Just gotta spwead it!"  
  
I should spread the soil.  
This soil is in perfect condition, no doubt. So, if I spread this soil
across the entire field, it should have the same effect as spreading the
fertilizer itself, shouldn't it? Thinking about it, I don't have much
time to work in the field alone, and I feel like my mother would notice
if I was spreading fertilizer. But, if I just dig up the soil from one
corner of the field and spread it, I'd just look like a toddler playing
in the sand.  
  
"It works."  
  
This is manageable.  
Misjudging the weight capacity of my body and the weight of the
fertilizer was a mistake, but if a nutrient-rich field is still created
in the end, it’ll be a success. Failure is not failure; it's just a step
on the road to success.  
  
"I need a Shkoop."  
  
A shovel. Or a spade. The name’s different depending on where you live.
There are big ones you hold with both hands, and ones you can hold with
one hand. The one I want is the one-handed one, that thing I’d call a
shovel. I want to dig up the soil with a shovel and spread it.  
But, there wasn't such an item in the game. There are times when it
happens. Things that exist in this world, but not in the game world. In
the game, only things used in the game… things like pickaxes and hoes
existed, but there was no shovel.  
So, even though I inherited items from the game and have almost maxed
out my inventory, I don't have a shovel. While I'm wondering what to do,
my mother, who seems to have finished her chores, came out.  
  
"Reni, what's wrong?"  
"Mama, Reni, wants a thingy to dig in the dirt."  
"Something to dig the soil with?"  
"Ya."  
  
"Pwease," I said, looking up at my mother.  
A toddler playing in the sandbox. There's nothing strange about a
two-year-old wanting a shovel. Since she does field work, she probably
has a shovel… or so I thought…  
  
"…I'm sorry, Reni"  
  
My mother distorted her beautiful face—which has been looking haggard
lately—in sadness.  
  
"We don't have the money to buy one."  
"…No money."  
  
I was so stunned by the unexpected reply that my mouth fell open. Then,
my mother bent down in front of me and looked directly into my eyes.  
  
"Papa and Mama are trying their best, but I'm sorry."  
"It's awight. I understand."  
  
I nodded vigorously at her serious face.  
No, I knew we were poor. I just didn't think we couldn't even buy a
shovel—or rather, I didn't think we didn't have one. I guess the reality
is that my family is barely making ends meet with only the bare
necessities.  
  
"Reni, will look awound the house. Maybe find something."  
  
I told my mother that and used the dash skill I finally mastered as a
two-year-old.  
Yes. Well, it's only slightly faster than walking; it's still very slow.
I could hear my mother calling me back with "Reni!", but I pretended not
to hear and circled the house.  
I told my mother, "I'll look around the house. I might find something
lying around," but it was just a way to buy time and create evidence.
What I really wanted to do was—  
  
"Aitemu bokku shu."  
  
Item box!  
I should have just looked for something that could be used as a shovel
from my existing items instead of saying such a childish thing about
possibly having one at home.  
Leave it to me!
