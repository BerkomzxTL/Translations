# Chapter 25・I Understand the Circumstances

As a result, Samyu fainted the moment I called her name….  
I was really worried that she would fall over the wall, but she didn't.
And she was back to normal in a few seconds, so I'm going to just ignore
it and consider it Samyu's special condition. She seems fine when she's
holding me (she does behave suspiciously though).  
We climbed down from the wall, and now Samyu and I are holding hands on
our way back home.  
  
“Samyu, can all elves do that?”  
“Well, if you’re talking about ‘mana manipulation’...”  
“Mana manipulation?”  
  
When I asked Samyu about the wall climbing and the bow and arrow
earlier, she mentioned a new term called \[Mana Manipulation\].  
I’ve never heard that before; it wasn’t in the game.  
  
“Elves can manipulate mana to enhance their physical abilities. When I
climbed the wall and when I shot the One-Horned Rabbit, I was enhancing
my abilities using mana manipulation.”  
“I see.”  
“Elves are a race skilled in mana manipulation. Humans can’t do it
because they have inherently low amounts of mana in their bodies. In
contrast, elves have mana circulating throughout their bodies along with
their blood, so they have high amounts of mana and can control it
easily. And they live longer than humans.”  
  
I nodded in agreement at Samyu’s explanation.  
Elves were a race with high mana levels, but the game didn't explain
why, so this is new information.  
  
“I wonder if I can do it too…”  
  
My status shows me as an Elf, but…  
I don’t have pointy ears.  
I touched my ears with my free hand, wondering about it.  
Then I felt Samyu tighten her grip on my hand.  
  
“Samyu, if my muscles get stronger, will I become stronger too?”  
“Yes! Absolutely!”  
  
Samyu nodded firmly to reassure me.  
  
“There’s no doubt that Lady Reni has amazing potential. Currently, your
body is not fully developed, so you can’t fully utilize your powers to
protect yourself. As you grow, and your body develops—around 13 to 16
years old, I think—you should be able to use all your hidden powers.”  
“Mhm.”  
“So for now, let's keep walking.”  
“Okay!”  
  
Samyu’s words lightened my heart.  
After all, I’d maxed out my level and reincarnated, but I don’t think my
abilities without equipment were maxed out.  
It would be meaningless if I stayed this weak forever.  
But if there's an age-related modifier, as Samyu says, then I could
understand.  
In other words, I’m currently under a negative modifier.  
My level is maxed out, but I can't use it to its full potential.  
But once my body grows, the negative modifier will disappear. Then I'll
be invincible.  
  
“……Status”  
  
While walking, I muttered quietly, so Samyu couldn’t hear.  
Then, my status appeared before me.  
  
“Ah!”  
“What is it, Lady Reni?”  
“Nn, nothing.”  
  
Samyu reacted to the sound I accidentally made.  
I tried to cover it up, and she looked puzzled, but didn’t press
further.  
Samyu can’t see my status and probably thought it was just me talking to
myself.  
She turned back to the path home, and I followed.  
As we walked, holding hands, I took another look at my status. There
was―  
  
\* Name: Reni Shurm Guora  
\* Race: Elf  
\* Age: 3  
\* Level: 999 (-97%)  
  
What! A negative modifier display has been added!  
That's why my voice slipped.  
This display wasn't there before I talked to Samyu. In other words, the
status doesn't show everything about my current situation; it displays
things I’ve become aware of and understand in numbers.  
That's a pretty big negative modifier, but I guess that's to be expected
for a three-year-old. With equipment, there shouldn’t be any problem.  
And what I wanted to check was…  
  
“…Elf”  
  
Yes. My race.  
Even after getting information from Samyu, my race is still listed as
\[Elf\].  
In other words, if I’m an elf, there’s a possibility that mana is
circulating within my body, and by honing my \[Mana Manipulation\], I
can become even stronger.  
In the game, I couldn’t get stronger after maxing out my level, but
here, there's a possibility of becoming even stronger.  
That means…  
  
“Unlimited potential!”  
  
—As expected of the strongest three-year-old!  
  
I was walking energetically, excitedly towards the village.  
Every step is important to reducing the negative modifier!  
As we finally approached the village, I saw my father and mother.  
  
“Papa, Mama!”  
  
It seems they were waiting for me not at home, but at the entrance to
the village.  
I wonder how long they waited. I hope it wasn't too long…  
Anyway, it should be okay to show my face now, so I took off my hood.  
My father spotted me immediately—  
  
“Reni!!”  
  
My father ran towards me like a spring had been released.  
He probably tried to hug me like he always does.  
But he failed; he passed right through me and Samyu.  
  
“…Papa.”  
  
My father, who was supposed to have hugged me, is now embracing the
ground.  
No, I didn't avoid him.  
For some reason, the moment my father tried to hug me, Samyu smoothly
pulled my hand away, preventing me from coming in contact with him.  
Then, without even sparing a glance at my father, she walked towards my
mother.  
  
“We’re late, I apologize.”  
  
Saying this, Samyu placed my hand in my mother’s.  
My mother took my hand, bent down, and looked me in the eye.  
  
“Reni, are you hurt?”  
“No.”  
“Good.”  
  
Saying that, my mother hugged me tightly.  
I'd left a note, but I guess she was still worried after all. I didn't
expect her to be waiting at the village entrance, and a lot of time had
passed, so she might have been anxious.  
  
“Because Reni is strong.”  
“Yes. That's right.”  
  
Hearing this, my mother smiled and hugged me tightly again. Then, still
holding me, she stood up.  
  
“Samyu, thank you.”  
“No, I am grateful that you contacted me and that I had the opportunity
to meet Lady Reni.”  
  
Samyu knelt as she had done with me, looking up happily at my mother who
was standing with me in her arms.  
Then, she slowly opened her mouth and said—  
  
“—My Queen.”  
  
—Queen!?  
  
“Mama, Mama is a queen?”  
  
When Samyu said that, I immediately confirmed it with my mother.  
After all, a queen is a very important person, right? In such a rural
village? Huh??  
I stared at my mother's face in shock.  
Yes, she is undeniably a stunning beauty.  
But, a queen…?  
  
“Yes. Mama is the Queen of the Elves.”  
“Mama is… the… Queen of the Elves…”  
  
Powerful words… Too much power, my mind can't keep up.  
I stared blankly at my mother when a large hand enveloped her and me in
a hug.  
It was warm and—  
  
“Former, that is. Now, she’s my precious wife.”  
“Papa.”  
  
My father must have gotten up from the ground and come closer.  
From the tight hug, I could feel how much he cared about my mother and
me.  
My mother felt it too, of course.  
She murmured, "Oh my," smiling, and laughing happily at my father's
words.  
Then, she handed me over to my father.  
My father's hug is stable and comfortable, I like it.  
So, to help my mother, I reached out to father.  
Then—  
  
“Ugh.”  
  
For some reason, Samyu slumped forward and fell to the ground.  
  
“…Her Majesty’s blissful smile. Lady Reni’s absolute trust. Ugh, to
think that such a human man… ugh… ghh…”  
  
Samyu pounded the ground with her fists in frustration.  
Her beautiful blue eyes were hidden behind a torrent of tears…  
  
—It seems there's a lot more to this story.
