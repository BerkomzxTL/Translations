# Chapter 43・It’s a Tea Party

Madeleines, financiers, cookies, and cherry pie. Are those scones and
caramel over there? Everything looks delicious.  
Among the many sweets, one stood out. In the center, small, thumb-sized
brown sweets were neatly arranged on a large plate. Their surfaces were
glossy, sparkling in the light.  
  
“Chocolate.”  
  
Baked goods aside, they even had chocolate prepared.  
I’d never eaten chocolate in the village, and I’ve never even seen it
sold in the town of Slanita. It must be expensive and rare.  
As I muttered this without thinking, Carrie laughed happily.  
  
“Reni knows about chocolate. It’s very sweet and delicious!”  
“Mhm. I want to eat it.”  
“Yes!”  
  
Hearing this, Carrie signaled to a woman standing near the table. It was
one of the women in uniform who always encourages her. The woman took a
piece of chocolate from the large central plate and moved it to the
plate in front of me.  
The other two women fulfilled their duty of serving tea and gave Samyu
some sweets.  
Judging by the women's uniforms and roles, they must be Carrie's maids.
Given that she's a princess, it's not surprising that she has such
attendants.  
Once the maids had served tea and the first sweets, Carrie cleared her
throat.  
  
“Then, let me reiterate. It’s undeniable that we would have suffered
significant damage this time if it weren’t for Reni. I am truly
grateful.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
I nodded in response to Carrie’s dignified words.  
When I see how mature Carrie is despite her young age, I think she's
amazing.  
Then, the gray-haired middle-aged man sitting opposite me spoke.  
  
“I would like to extend my thanks as well. Thanks to you, Her Royal
Highness, the Princess, and her subordinates were saved. I am the lord
of this land, including the city of Reoliga. My name is Garim Gaillard.
I hold the title of Count.”  
“Count Gaillard.”  
  
Apparently, the gray-haired middle-aged man is the lord, Count Gaillard.
He has a pleasant expression, and his eyes drooped gently.  
  
“Let me also express my gratitude! I am Thomas, the mayor. When I heard
that the Princess had been attacked on the way here, I was terrified. We
rarely have the opportunity to welcome a member of the royal family.”  
  
The elderly man resembling Santa Claus—Mayor Thomas—was visibly
relieved, placing his hand on his chest. While Carrie’s safety is
important, he had probably wanted to avoid such a serious incident
happening in his jurisdiction.  
I nodded, understanding his feelings.  
Everyone has different worries depending on their position.  
  
“Then, Reni, please have your tea before it gets cold.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
The conversation seemed like it was going to continue, but Carrie
quickly cut it short and offered me tea.  
So, without hesitation, I drank the tea I'd been served—  
  
“Mm! Delicious.”  
“Really!? I’m so glad…!”  
“This tea… smells like flowers.”  
“Yes! I chose a rose-scented tea!”  
  
When I said that, Carrie’s face brightened. She must have thought of
many things for me.  
  
“I’ll try the chocolate too.”  
“Yes!”  
  
After declaring that to Carrie, I extended my cat claws. Then, using my
cat claw as a pick, I pricked the chocolate.  
…See, it's a cat's paw.  
Unlike human hands, it's difficult to pick up small things. Then—  
  
“Ah, the inside…”  
  
The glossy surface of the chocolate. From where I’d pricked it with my
claw, a rich sauce oozed out.  
Apparently, it wasn’t just plain chocolate; there was sauce inside. Red
sauce was leaking out from beside my claw….  
I quickly took a bite. The fragrant chocolate and the oozing strawberry
sauce were a great match. But…  
  
“Delicious. But, the sauce, it’s a waste.”  
  
That’s right. It’s delicious, but it’s a waste.  
Because I pricked it with my claw, the sauce spilled out, but ideally,
when you put it in your mouth and bite it, the chocolate and sauce
should harmonize nicely.  
Even though it’s still edible with the spilled sauce, it feels like the
deliciousness is halved. What a shame…  
If I had human hands, I think I could just pick it up and eat it, but a
cat’s paw isn't suitable for such tasks. What should I do?  
I frowned.  
Then, I heard huffing and puffing sounds from beside me—  
  
“Lady Reni. If I may be so bold, may I bring it to your mouth?”  
  
Samyu’s breathing and determined eyes.  
Um….  
I can’t take off my \[Cat's Paw Gloves\].  
So, if she’s offering to feed me, I’d be very grateful. But I wonder if
Samyu will be alright… Won't you collapse? I feel like she’s already at
her limit…  
  
“…Samyu, if you close your eyes, will you be okay?”  
“Yes, leave it to me!!”  
  
Samyu picked up the chocolate from her plate and carefully moved it
toward me. Her hands were trembling, so she held the chocolate with her
right hand and steadied her wrist firmly with her left.  
  
“Deep breath, deep breath… I am an elf who can do it… an elf who will
succeed…”  
  
Samyu muttered while bringing the chocolate to my mouth. Then, she
closed her eyes tightly.  
I opened my mouth, “Ahn,” after confirming that Samyu had closed her
eyes—  
  
“Mm! It’s different from before!”  
  
I ate the chocolate in one bite and broke it with my teeth. Then, the
strawberry scent wafted up to my nostrils. What a nice smell!  
It wasn’t there when I ate the one I’d pricked with my claw. Breaking it
in my mouth is definitely the correct way to eat it!  
  
“Samyu, it’s so delicious.”  
  
It was so delicious that I couldn’t help but grin. I put my hand on my
cheek and laughed softly, looking up at Samyu.  
There, her blue eyes were—  
  
“Ah, uh… ugh… hiu…”  
  
Ah…. Samyu opened her eyes because I called her name….  
  
“…I’m sorry…”  
  
Her breathing stopped and then started again….  
Normally, she would faint and her eyes would roll back. But now she's
probably on high alert. She’s showing some strange behavior, almost but
not quite rolling her eyes.  
I apologized involuntarily and looked away.  
If I don’t, Samyu will have a really hard time….  
  
“Re-Reni!”  
“Hm?”  
  
At that moment, Carrie called out to me, so I turned towards her.  
Carrie was holding chocolate in her hand—  
  
“Mine is, um… that,… that,… orange sauce!”  
“Wow, that looks delicious too.”  
“Ri-right!?”  
“Mhm.”  
“Then, please…!”  
  
Carrie said this, and brought the chocolate to my mouth.  
The chocolate in her hand is slightly different in shape from the one
Samyu had given me. ...Does that mean it's okay to eat it like this?  
If I prick it with my claw, I won’t be able to savor it properly, so
this is extremely helpful.  
So, I ate it in one bite.  
The taste is—  
  
“Delicious!”  
“Re-really!?”  
“Mhm! Orange goes well with sourness!"  
  
The sweetness and sourness were just right. And, because I broke it in
my mouth, the fragrance spread wonderfully again, and it was very
delicious!  
My face was grinning again, and I put my hand to my cheek.  
Then—  
  
“Ah—!!”  
  
A sudden loud voice.  
Startled, I turned towards the sound, and there stood a knight with red
hair.  
Apparently, she had been watching me and Carrie.  
Her expression was like she’d been struck by lightning; she was
surprised, her eyes wide open.  
  
“…Excuse me.”  
  
After saying this, the red-haired knight quickly bowed. Her face was
turning red at an alarming rate. Hmm. She’s a little sweaty too? Is she
alright? She seems to be trembling slightly…  
One of the maids approached to check on her. Apparently, nothing’s
wrong, and Carrie then exchanged glances with the maid and turned back
to me.  
  
“I’m sorry for startling you. She seems to be alright.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
That's good then.  
  
“Reni, um, well…, this one too, what… do you think…?”  
“I want to eat it.”  
“Yes! That’s right!!”  
  
Carrie offered me the next sweet.  
This time it was a madeleine. Its small shell shape was cute and round.
I might have been able to grasp a madeleine with my cat paw, but Carrie
brought it to my mouth again, so I ate it without hesitation.  
Mm! The moist texture and the faint scent of eggs. It’s just as
delicious!  
  
“Lady Reni…! Lady Reni…! Can you please give me one more chance...!"  
  
Samyu seems to have returned from battling the whites of her eyes. In
her hand was a round biscuit.  
  
“Reni wants to try that too.”  
“Yes!! Thank you very much!!”  
  
Even though I should be the one thanking her since I’m the one being
fed, Samyu for some reason is expressing her gratitude energetically.  
The biscuit I was fed seemed to be made with plenty of butter, and it
was very crispy!  
  
“Reni, then, next is this…”  
“Lady Reni! This one!”  
  
As I was fed sweets one after another, my stomach was full in no time.  
It’s such a happy experience to be able to try a little of so many
different kinds of sweets… I put my hand to my cheek and let out a sigh
of contentment.  
  
“Carrie, thank you. This was so much fun.”  
“Ye-yes…! …I… feel the same!”  
  
Carrie said this, furrowing her brows as if suppressing something.  
  
“I… this is the first time I’ve felt this much joy.”  
  
Her hands clenched tightly on her lap.  
Then, she whispered softly.  
  
“…I’ve been targeted by someone for a long time.”
