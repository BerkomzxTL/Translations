# Chapter 24・Samyu Arumu

Noticing the elf girl desperately fighting, I decided to conceal my
presence. I am air… I am air… After a while, the elf girl let out a
large sigh, then murmured, “I’m sorry.”  
  
“I lost control of my body, but I’ve managed to regain it. How are you,
Lady Reni? …Um, is my touch alright?”  
  
Her voice sounds worried. But if I speak now, a battle would start up
again. So I didn’t make a sound, and just nodded while being held.  
Though my form was invisible, she seemed to notice my gestures, and the
elf girl breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
“This is my first time holding someone smaller than myself… I’m glad you
don’t mind, Lady Reni.”  
  
Saying that, the elf girl smiled softly.  
Yes. I truly understand that you cherish me very much. ...Although,
something seems a little off.  
  
“Now then, Lady Reni. We're going to climb over this wall now, so please
hold on tight."  
  
After saying that, the elf girl released my hand.  
Then she compared the tree next to the wall with the wall itself…  
  
The elf girl’s beautiful blue eyes.  
They seemed to flash for a moment.  
In that instant—  
  
“Waow!”  
  
I’d been telling myself that I was air, trying not to make a sound, but
I couldn’t help but let my voice slip out unintentionally.  
Because I was really surprised just now!  
The elf girl first leaped towards the wall, then kicked off the wall
towards the tree and sprang up diagonally.  
Then she grabbed a thick branch conveniently located and spun around
once.  
Just like that, her body, soaring through the air, drew an arc before
landing on top of the wall.  
I can't believe she could move like that...!  
  
“Amazing! Amazing!”  
  
I’d also used equipment to jump down from the second floor and jump
high, but it was never this acrobatic!  
I raised my voice in excitement, and the elf girl laughed bashfully
before setting me down.  
The top of the wall was wide enough for two adults to walk
side-by-side.  
  
“Lady Reni, are you alright?”  
“Uh-huh! It was fun!”  
  
From atop the wall, the streets were visible, with the roofs of
two-story buildings directly ahead.  
After speaking to me, the elf girl directed her gaze to outside of the
town.  
I looked in the same direction, and there were grasslands stretching
out, with white stones scattered here and there.  
It’s night, so I can’t see very far, but I could make out the general
scene thanks to the starlight.  
  
“Lady Reni, can you see the monster over there?”  
“Mhm.”  
  
The place the elf girl was pointing.  
There was a white rock, and in front of it, a gray rabbit about the size
of a basketball. The distance is about 10 meters, I think.  
  
“That’s a One-Horned Rabbit.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
A One-Horned Rabbit. Among monsters, its body is small, and it isn’t
very strong. It rarely attacks people and is timid by nature. Its
appearance is just a rabbit with a single horn on its forehead, so not
many people feel threatened by it.  
But a startled One-Horned Rabbit might rush at a human, breaking their
leg or, in a bad case, cutting a major artery in their thigh, resulting
in injuries or even death.  
Because they appear near town, we’re told to be careful when straying
from the path.  
In the game, it’s the kind of enemy you’d face at levels 1-10, the first
enemy you encounter.  
  
“Oh, it ran away.”  
  
The One-Horned Rabbit in front of the white stone hopped and ran away.  
Since I wasn’t wearing the \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\], I couldn’t follow its
figure.  
But the elf girl seems to be able to see it—  
  
“Lady Reni. Now, let me show you the power of a Forest Hunter.”  
  
Saying that, the elf girl brought the large bow she was carrying on her
back to the front of her body.  
She took an arrow from the quiver on her back and looked straight
ahead.  
Then she placed her right hand on the string and adjusted her grip on
the bow with her left hand.  
After raising the bow once, she lowered it while drawing the string
back.  
Her extended left arm and bent right arm. Her determined face could be
seen beyond the bow, drawn with perfect balance.  
  
“Here I go.”  
  
I can’t see what she was aiming at.  
The blue eyes staring into the darkness glittered—  
That moment…  
  
“Hah!!”  
  
Along with the sound, I understood that something had poured out from
the elf girl's body.  
That power gathered into the arrow, and the released arrow flew as a
streak of light.  
The light reached the ground and scattered into a brilliant burst.  
Then, a cry of “Gyaaa!” echoed from the distance.  
  
“ …Amazing!!”  
  
To be honest, I didn’t understand at all.  
Because I couldn’t even see the target.  
But I understand.  
Hitting a single rabbit running far away with an arrow. Doing that at
night. And that agility a moment ago... she’s really, really strong!!  
  
“So strong!”  
  
Unintentionally, I jumped towards the elf girl, causing my hood to slip
off.  
But this isn’t the time to care about that…  
Because she was so, so cool! Using a bow and arrow is so cool!!  
  
“Amazing! Ummm, ah… by the way, your name…”  
  
I was about to call her name, overcome with emotion, but then I realized
I didn't know her name.  
No, I thought it would be better if I didn’t know.  
But she showed me such a cool side to her. It would be a shame not to
ask the name of such a wonderful girl.  
  
“…What’s your name?”  
  
Under the twinkling starlight.  
The elf girl’s golden hair, illuminated by it, gleamed, and her
beautiful blue eyes were clear—  
  
“Lady Reni. My apologies for the late introduction. My name is Samyu
Arumu.”  
“Samyu Arumu.”  
“Yes!”  
  
As I repeated her name, I could see her blue eyes getting wet and
tearful.  
So, I called her name with all my heart.  
  
“Samyu~”  
  
A very strong and cool elf girl.
