# Chapter 100・Because Your World Is Precious

First of all, school isn't scary anymore.  
I never thought having just one friend would make such a difference.  
Maybe it's also good that I've already been told I'll have to repeat the
year; there's no pressure.  
Even if I go to school from now on, I'd still fail, so I might as well
start in the spring. In other words, there’s no point in going now, so
if I'm having a hard time, I can take a day off, and I can just go to
classes if I feel up to attending. It’s the perfect rehabilitation for
someone like me, a hikikomori.  
If I were the only one who knew this, my classmates would probably be
angry. But everyone knows I failed the year because I’ve been absent
from school, so they seem to have put me in the category of, "Well, it
can't be helped with that girl."  
Although I was an outsider at first, I’ve been able to fit into their
daily life as "that kind of person."  
Of course, it’s largely due to Shiori-chan’s presence—  
  
"Rina! Shiori-chan is here!"  
"Mhm."  
  
My mother called from the entrance. I hurriedly went down from my room
on the second floor.  
When I went outside, Shiori-chan was waiting for me.  
  
"Thank you as always."  
"Not at all! I enjoy going to school with you, Rina-san. But more than
that, aren't I being a nuisance? Isn't it troublesome for you that I'm
coming along...?"  
"No. I'm happy you're here, Shiori-chan."  
  
Luckily, Shiori-chan lives on the same bus route to high school as I do.
Apparently, she moved to this area for high school, not junior high.  
My breath is still white, but the days seem to be getting longer.  
Whenever I walk with Shiori-chan, my heart flutters. Even though the
route to school is always the same, it's fun when we're together.  
When I smile naturally, Shiori-chan looks at me and smiles back
happily.  
...I never thought a day like this would come.  
Walking together in the hallways during class change. Eating lunch
together. Going to a convenience store after school to buy steamed buns
together, and eating them on a park bench.  
  
It's all so fresh.  
Everything, everything, I'm truly happy…  
  
Even though it was set in stone that I’d already failed the year, my
parents were happy that I started going to school.  
They thought things might start to turn around from here.  
I felt a similar excitement when thinking about the future.  
  
Going to school normally. Going to college normally. Getting a normal
job, living a normal life, living normally.  
  
—It might be possible.  
  
I started straying from that path in junior high school. I wanted to go,
but I couldn't... Every morning, I would cry and fight with my mother,
who tried to get me to go to school. It was too embarrassing to even
call it a fight.  
Me crying because I didn't want to go, couldn't leave my room, and my
mother crying, asking why.  
My father couldn't do anything about my mother and me...  
What he bought me was a PC.  
He said that now I could study online, and there are online schools too.
He said I didn't have to go to school, I just had to try my best to
study.  
So I started playing games on the computer while studying.  
  
...I like games.  
  
Because they saved me from those days filled only with darkness and a
sense of confinement. I blamed myself for not being normal, and it saved
me from the days of sadness.  
  
That’s why...  
  
I noticed something was off.  
Because, there's no way I could adapt to school this easily. The world
was much darker, more painful, and only contained a hopeless me.  
That I might be able to lead a normal life... That's even more of a
dream than being reincarnated in a game world.  
...Yes. It’s a dream.  
  
—This world  
  
"Shiori-chan."  
"Yes, what’s up? It's cold today, but the plum blossoms should be
blooming soon. Spring is just around the corner."  
  
After school, we sat on a park bench and talked.  
I love this repetition of everyday life in the cold weather more than
anything.  
Her black hair in three braids and her gentle dark eyes. Her hand,
pointing something out, is white and pretty.  
  
"—myu."  
  
I called her name. She had introduced herself as "Shiori-chan."  
But I called her by a different name. Again. This time, in a louder
voice.  
  
"Samyu."  
  
At that moment, her dark eyes widened. And then, she immediately frowned
sadly.  
  
"...N-no, that's not right. It's not allowed... It's fine, just like
this. This world is fine."  
“No… that’s wrong. No, no it’s not.”  
  
The girl with the black braided hair put her hand on my shoulder.  
It's okay to stay as it is, she's saying... It's okay to keep
dreaming.  
  
"Samyu... because, Samyu..."  
  
My eyes are hot. Tears started to overflow uncontrollably.  
I was happy. What I wanted, surely, was this kind of everyday life, this
kind of future.  
Going to school properly. Having friends. My parents getting along. Me
being on the "normal" track and living a normal life. But...but...  
  
"Samyu... Samyu has such beautiful, flowing golden hair... and such
pretty sky-blue eyes that sparkle when she infuses them with mana; such
incredibly beautiful eyes... my favorite color... "  
  
We made a guardian contract on top of the clock tower, right?  
Samyu almost fell from that high place, and I had to pull her back up
with all my strength.  
  
"You said you'd be my guardian, and you’re such a hardworking person who
can keep trying for a hundred years! You were sad about what happened to
mama and papa, but you were someone who could try to change
yourself…."  
  
My mother, the Elf Queen. Samyu, who obtained a treasure with my father
while she had only a short time left to live. My mother used it, and
left with my father. Samyu found out her hundred years of effort had
amounted to nothing.  
Carrying such sadness, Samyu continued to work hard.  
But in this world, all the efforts Samyu made are nowhere to be found.
Samyu is just an ordinary high school girl.  
  
"If you stay here, everything will disappear. ...Samyu's sadness, pain,
and suffering. All the hard work you did to overcome them... I know how
amazing Samyu is. The idea that it's not here...I hate that."  
  
I hate it. The idea that Samyu's efforts will disappear.  
Samyu deserves to be incredibly happy in return for all the effort she's
put in.  
  
"...It's truly fine, if it's me."  
  
Samyu gently hugged my shoulders  
  
"If you're happy, I don't mind what world I'm in. My efforts weren't to
show off my abilities... It was to be with you. That was the reason for
my efforts."  
  
Saying this, Samyu smiled.  
A truly happy smile.  
  
"If this world is what you want, then I will live in this world. I don't
need anything else. I'll just be by your side."  
  
Because that smile is so gentle.  
Because she has the most beautiful smile in this selfish world I
created.  
  
"Samyu... Samyu..."  
  
Why are you by my side?  
Did you really come all the way across the world to be here?  
  
"I... I'm like this. I look completely different. I'm not strong like I
was in that other world. I don't have anything."  
  
Silver hair and golden eyes. I'm the child of mama and papa, and my race
is elf. Level capped, with loads of overpowered equipment and items.
That's what Samyu met. She repeatedly told me how amazing I was. But
here I have nothing.  
  
"No, nothing has changed. I didn't want to be with you because you had
something. Your appearance doesn't matter. —Love isn't seen with the
eyes, but felt with the heart."  
  
Ahh...It's Samyu.  
Because she says that with such confidence.  
That's why my heart trembles...  
  
"My heart hasn't changed, in that world or this one. It's always pointed
at you. I want to be by your side. ...Together, we're invincible."
