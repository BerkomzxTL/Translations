# Chapter 78・Mission Accomplished

My body is hot. I also feel weak and sleepy.  
This is the same state I was in before Hasano performed the magic on
me.  
Apparently, I must have fallen asleep.  
Before I fell asleep, Hasano told me I'd had another \[Mana Rampage\]
and that I was starting to disappear.  
I'm relieved to hear the fire in the Elven Forest was put out, but…  
  
"Samyu...?"  
  
I open my bleary eyes.  
There, looking at me with concern, were beautiful blue eyes.  
Her eyes were red, perhaps from rubbing them.  
I instinctively reached out, but she took my hand before I could touch
her.  
  
"Lady Reni… Are you feeling unwell?"  
"Mhm… again, it's kind of the same."  
"I'm so sorry… It seems you’ve returned to the same state as before the
spell…"  
"No, it's not Samyu's fault."  
  
Thanks to my sleep, even though I feel feverish, it's not so bad that I
can't get up.  
I slowly raised my upper body and Samyu helped me.  
As I sat up, I saw a girl with long black hair…  
  
"Ah, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]."  
  
Wings sprouted from her back, and a thick, long tail from her rear.  
It's \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]. She was trying to burn down the Elven
Forest and was supposed to have been caught by Hasano…  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] isn't a boneless ham anymore. She had
folded her wings, tucked away her tail, and was skillfully sitting on a
chair.  
  
"It seems you've finally awakened, little elf."  
  
As if responding to my words, her tail swayed from side to side.  
Maybe they made up with each other while I was sleeping?  
  
"How long was I asleep?"  
"Lady Reni collapsed this morning. It's almost evening now."  
"Waow… almost half a day…"  
  
I slept longer than I thought.  
  
"Lady Reni used her power to extinguish the fire in the Elven Forest.
This put a strain on your \[Mana Pathways\], leading to another \[Mana
Rampage\]."  
"Mhm."  
"And… unlike before, due to the sudden changes in your body, it seems
your body and soul were separated."  
"Body and soul…"  
  
As I listened to Samyu's explanation, I nodded and said, "I see."  
I thought I was just recalling memories from my past life, but maybe it
was the sensation of my soul leaving my body.  
It was like my soul was being drawn to the world of my past life…  
  
"I have returned your soul to your body once more."  
"\[Black Bahamut Dragon\] did?"  
  
I tilt my head, puzzled.  
Let me try to recall what happened at that time.  
  
"Reni was about to be swallowed by a black whirlpool."  
"…Yes."  
"But I heard Samyu's voice."  
"…My voice?"  
"Mhm. Samyu was crying… I thought, 'Don't cry.' Then, light appeared."  
  
I’m always causing trouble for others. I’m always apologizing and living
my life. I’m constantly blaming myself for what I can't do.  
…I was about to be swallowed up by it.  
But then I heard Samyu's voice… and it sounded like she was crying. I
felt like I had to wipe away Samyu's tears.  
  
"I also thought about mama and papa. Then I heard Hasano's voice too."  
"Hmm hmm. Your soul was about to disappear from this world. It wouldn't
have been strange if that had happened, but there must have been a
trigger. Then, I helped you, adjusted the power of the \[Jewel\], and
stopped the mana."  
"I heard someone say 'Concentrate!'"  
"That was me!"  
  
After saying that, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] puffed out her chest
proudly.  
Apparently, my awakening in this world again was thanks to everyone's
efforts.  
  
"Thank you both."  
  
First, I thanked the two people in the room.  
Then, Samyu, unusually, looked away and hid her face.  
I thought Samyu would be more happy…  
  
"I'll thank Hasano later."  
  
A lot has happened since this morning, so Samyu must be tired.  
Hasano isn't here now, so I'll have to thank her later.  
  
"I'm truly glad you didn't disappear. After all, you were about to
disappear along with the \[Jewel\]."  
"Along with the Jewel?"  
"That’s right. You possess a \[Jewel\], don't you?"  
  
…Should I answer this?  
I glanced up at Samyu, who gave a slight nod.  
  
"Lady Reni, it seems \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] came to check on your
\[Jewel\]. And she says that the seven \[Jewels\] were created by
her."  
"I see…!"  
  
The origin of the \[Jewels\] was unknown in the game, but apparently, it
belonged to \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\].  
I got excited.  
The opening cinematic of the game, featuring \[The Black Bahamut
Dragon\], and the goddess. Maybe the \[Jewels\] were depicted there
too.  
And I have one of them.  
This is amazing. I'm so happy.  
I smiled softly, and \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] sighed in
exasperation.  
  
"Trying to steal my \[Jewel\], and yet you can still smile so easily…"  
"So, you were looking for Reni because you wanted the Jewel?"  
"That's right! Because something seemed off, I thought I'd just retrieve
the \[Jewel\] without needing the vessel…"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] clicked her tongue.  
In other words, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]…  
  
"Before we got to the Elven Forest, were you going to attack Reni and
the others?"  
"……Well, that might have been the case."  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] turned her face away from me.  
It seems Samyu's decision to keep running without stopping was the right
one.  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]'s "I don't need the vessel" probably meant
that she didn't need me.  
If we had stopped there, I might have been attacked and killed.  
If I had been like I was before Hasano cast her magic on me, I might not
have been able to use my original power or the power of the \[Jewel\]
effectively, and I would have likely lost.  
  
"There's no way I'd stop in front of someone emanating such killing
intent."  
"But you didn't have to blow me away!"  
"Because you were in the way."  
  
Samyu must have considered various options before deciding to just run
through.  
As a result, the Elven Forest was set on fire, but I put it out, so no
problem!  
So that's it.  
  
"Reni has a Jewel."  
"Umu. That much is certain. So, when did you get it?"  
"Probably since before I was born."  
"Ugh… since before you were born…"  
  
My answer made \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] twitch her cheek.  
  
"Lady Reni is special. Her mother used the \[Jewel\]. And she inherited
it when she was born."  
"Oh? An elf used a \[Jewel\]. That's rare. I thought humans were more
likely to do such things."  
"……Lady Reni's mother was also special."  
  
Right. An elf becoming human is unprecedented.  
Also, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] doesn't seem angry about the
\[Jewel\] being used.  
  
"I understand it being passed down from mother to child. Indeed, if
someone uses a \[Jewel\], it's passed down to their child. But…"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] looked at me as if observing me with her
purple eyes.  
  
"It's strange. If there's no one to inherit the \[Jewel\], only the
\[Jewel\] remains in the world. The soul will disappear, but the
\[Jewel\] should remain. And yet, you were about to disappear along with
the \[Jewel\]. The \[Jewel\] and your soul are closely intertwined… What
kind of mechanism caused this…"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] sighed deeply.  
  
"Now then, here comes the important part. I need you to stay alive."  
"Need me?"  
  
I thought I'd be told, "Return the \[Jewel\]!" or "I don't need the
vessel!", but it seems not.  
Rather, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] seems to want me to live…  
  
"The seven \[Jewels\] support this world. If it disappears along with
your soul, the world will end."  
"……End?"  
"End."  
"Destruction?"  
"Destruction."  
  
A jolt of electricity ran down my spine at those words.  
The end of my beloved world…! That means…!  
  
"Service termination notice…!"  
  
The worst thing in an online game…! Server shutdown…!  
  
"You must stay alive until we can separate the \[Jewel\] from your soul,
or until the \[Jewel\] settles in the world."  
"Mhm."  
"I can't have you disappearing due to a \[Mana Rampage\]. Understand?"  
"Mhm."  
  
Seriously. I nodded seriously.  
Server shutdown. That must be prevented at all costs.  
And—  
  
"It would be troubling if Reni disappeared due to a mana rampage."  
  
—This world I love so much.  
I want to see and experience more of it with my own five senses.  
  
"Well then. First, you should have the Elf Queen perform that ritual
again."  
"The one that narrows the mana pathways?"  
"Yes. But restricting the \[Mana Pathways\] alone won't be enough for
your body. Especially since you seem to overdo things, so it's like
trying to put out a fire with a cup of water."  
  
I nodded at \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]'s words.  
Even if I have the spell cast to narrow my \[Mana Pathways\], if I
overuse my mana like this time, I'll likely return to a \[Mana Rampage\]
state.  
I intend to thoroughly listen to Hasano's instructions and precautions,
and since I've experienced it once, I’d like to avoid ending up in the
same situation again. But, I'm sure I'll make mistakes.  
  
"Any other methods?"  
  
I stared intently at \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\].  
With this tone, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] probably knows another
way.  
And since she wants to separate the \[Jewel\] from my soul, I’m sure
she'll cooperate.  
Under my gaze, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] put her right hand
forward.  
  
"There are two things you must do now."  
  
Index finger and middle finger. Two fingers are pointing up.  
  
"One is to master \[Mana Manipulation\]. It’s not enough to just release
whatever you want. This is something elves excel at, so ask them for
proper guidance."  
"Mhm."  
  
I also wanted to train in \[Mana Manipulation\].  
It's probably not enough to just force power outwards as I did when
extinguishing the flames.  
  
"The other is…"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] let out a “heehee” laugh.  
  
"——A treasure hunt."
