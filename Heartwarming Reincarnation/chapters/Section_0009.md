# Chapter 9・The Debt Collectors Came

Hearing the loud knock on the door, my mother, who was working in the
kitchen, rushed to my side. She immediately opened the closet nearby and
shoved me inside.  
  
"Reni, stay here. No matter what, don't come out."  
"Mama."  
"Don't come out of there."  
  
My mother, with a serious expression, urged me again and quickly closed
the closet door. Immediately, I was enveloped in complete darkness.  
I could faintly smell the scent of clothes. It was the aroma of B-rank
material soapwort, harvested from the field. My mother always uses it
for laundry, and we had a large harvest from the improved field I helped
develop.  
As I was sniffing the familiar scent, there was a loud thud, followed by
several footsteps. It seems my mother had opened the door and the debt
collectors came in.  
  
"Hey, hey, there's really nothing in this house."  
"Terrible."  
"This won't even cover the interest."  
  
Vulgar laughter and heavy, unceremonious footsteps echoed on the wooden
floor. Judging by the sound, there were probably three or four grown
men. I wonder if my mother is alright.  
  
"You should have already received the full amount a long time ago. I
told you not to come to my house. Now, please leave."  
  
It must have been terrifying to confront several adult men who looked
down on her, but my mother remained calm and composed.  
Ideally, she probably wanted to deal with them at the entrance and not
let them into the house, but if they force their way in, she can’t
really stop them.  
My mother's sharp tone urged them to leave quickly, causing the debt
collectors to laugh again.  
  
"Hey, hey, is that how you talk to someone you owe money to?"  
"Did we ask you to borrow money? You're the one who asked us for a
loan!!"  
  
Crash!  
  
I heard something break.  
…It was probably the plate of bread on the table.  
My family receives leftover bread from the village bakery. We can
harvest vegetables, but we can’t grow bread in the fields.  
My mother works hard in the early morning to receive this bread as a
kindness. Precious, precious bread.  
The debt collectors must have knocked the plate off the table.  
  
"Listen, I have the promissory note here. It's got your name on it. It's
an official document."  
"…But I've paid everything written there."  
"What?! You've only been paying the interest!"  
  
Clatter!  
  
After the debt collectors' angry shouts, something hit the closet,
making a loud noise.  
Probably the table, kicked by one of them, flew and accidentally hit the
closet. At that moment, my mother shouted.  
  
"Stop it! Stop making a mess in the house! The money… I'll pay…"  
"Oh? How? We've been telling you it's not enough!"  
  
The debt collectors laughed at my mother's words.  
  
"It's not enough! Not enough at all! And there's nothing of value in
this house… Ah, there is one thing."  
"Such a beauty would be worth something!"  
“I’ve been telling you this all along, but you just couldn’t agree, so
this is what's happening!"  
"You're so stubborn. We said we'd forgive your debt if you sold
yourself."  
  
From the debt collectors' words, I sensed that things were taking a
dangerous turn.  
This is it. They're not asking for money; they're asking for my mother
herself.  
My mother is indeed beautiful. To be honest, she's almost goddess-like.
It's not strange for someone to want to possess her—  
  
"It's a shame, though. If you had given birth to a child, and it was a
girl, we could have sold both of you."  
"Really, a child dying. Being poor is just unbearable."  
"And you even thoughtfully prepared three chairs. Is one for the dead
kid?"  
  
…Eh? I'm dead…?  
No, maybe my father and mother pretended I died…?  
As I was confused by the sudden news, heavy footsteps echoed again.
Apparently, the debt collectors, who had stopped for a moment, started
moving violently again.  
And at the same time, I heard my mother gasp.  
  
"Hey!"  
"…!?"  
"If you don't want to be any more miserable, just come with us."  
"Stop it, let go…!"  
  
My mother's scream mixed with cries. She must have been grabbed by the
hand or something and was being dragged away.  
It's my limit. My mother wanted me to hide, so I stayed in the closet,
but I can't stand it anymore.  
I have a lot to think about, like the fact that I'm supposedly dead, but
that's not important right now.  
  
—I will subdue the debt collectors  
  
I made up my mind and started to open the closet door. Then…  
  
"What are you doing in someone else's house!!"  
  
The sound of frantic footsteps and a low, calm voice laced with anger.
It's father!  
  
"Let go!!"  
  
The voice was intertwined with the sounds of footsteps. Angry shouts and
noises echoed, and then—  
  
"Don't ever come back."  
  
My father's voice was a low growl. It was completely different from his
usual gentle voice. After that, I heard the sound of something rolling
on the ground. The debt collectors must have been thrown out of the
house. My father is so strong!  
So, I temporarily postponed getting out of the closet. I quietly
whispered there.  
  
"Item box."  
  
Item box!  
I chose the \[Hermit's Robe\]. This is a piece of equipment with the
ability to mask one's presence. In the game, equipping it allows you to
proceed through the map without encountering enemies.  
My three-year-old body is small, so the robe covered me completely from
head to toe.  
In that state, I quietly left the closet and left a note for my father
and mother saying, "Leave it to me."  
When I got to the front door, my father was hugging my mother, but he
didn't notice me passing by.  
I felt like he was looking at me, but he didn't call out to me, so I
think this robe has some kind of presence-concealing, or perhaps even
invisibility, effect.  
What I'm going to do in this state is—  
  
―Let's go after the debt collectors.
