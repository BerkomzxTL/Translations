# Chapter 48・Reni Is a Genius

A chaotic tea party ended, and night fell.  
The red-haired knight, Pio, searched for the source of the Living Mail
and its surroundings, but didn't achieve the results she had hoped
for.  
Since no other Living Mail were found nearby, Carrie decided to stay at
Mayor Thomas's house.  
The original itinerary was to stay overnight and then immediately depart
for the capital, considered the safest place, with Count Gaillard.  
However, considering the attack by the dragon and Living Mail, Count
Gaillard decided to return to the capital first, increase security, and
then come back to pick up Carrie.  
Until then, the current number of guards would patrol, with Reni and
Samyu joining them. That was deemed sufficient for safety.  
  
Currently staying at Thomas's house were Reni, Samyu, Carrie, Pio, three
maids, and the guard soldiers.  
Thomas welcomed them with a smile, and Count Gaillard left Reoliga City
immediately after the Living Mail incident.  
  
"Today was quite eventful…"  
  
Carrie had already prepared for bed and was lying in it.  
In her hand she held a golden, round bell. The \[Detection Bell\] she
received from Reni.  
She shifted from lying on her back to her side and gently opened her
hand.  
  
"…Cute."  
  
Carrie felt her cheeks relax.  
It was only natural; it was a first for her.  
  
"Can I… call her a friend...?"  
  
Her murmured words received no answer.  
She had spoken with the maids before bed, and they had told her that
Reni considered her a friend, but Carrie still lacked confidence.  
  
"Such a cute… strong… cool person… For someone like that to be friends
with me…"  
  
Won't she be disliked? Wouldn't she be a nuisance?  
Carrie's worry was that her feelings would cause trouble for Reni.  
The troublesome second princess. Feeling plain and weak, Carrie found
being a hindrance the most painful thing.  
  
"Perhaps it would have been better if I had stayed in the capital..."  
  
Originally, Carrie had resided in the capital. She left because her
older brother, the First Prince, was to undergo the ceremony to become
the Crown Prince..  
The ceremony to enthrone the crown prince was to be a grand affair. Many
people would gather in the capital, and the royal palace itself would
see heavy traffic. This meant Carrie's safety would be more precarious
than before.  
Furthermore, high-ranking individuals from other countries would also
attend the ceremony. While Carrie could participate as a member of the
royal family, she didn’t want to cause any trouble. She didn't want to
do anything that might hinder her brother.  
Her family repeatedly assured her that security would be strengthened
and that they didn't consider her a nuisance, but Carrie chose to leave
the capital.  
However, because of that, she was attacked by a dragon and Living Mail.
Was Carrie's choice correct…?  
She creased her brow tightly.  
  
"…I will do what I can."  
  
She had never had confidence in her choices.  
But Carrie had always encouraged herself with those words.  
Even if she was backstabbed, even if the person who backstabbed her
smiled and flattered her to her face. She always remained vigilant,
always striving to maintain her dignity as a princess.  
She had also found people to support her.  
However, the number of people she could trust was small, and she found
herself becoming increasingly withdrawn.  
That’s why—  
  
"Reni…"  
  
Whispering that name, Carrie felt her chest grow warm.  
The furrow in her brow slowly smoothed out.  
  
"...If I hadn't left the royal capital, we wouldn't have met."  
  
She lacked confidence in her choice.  
But thinking about it, she naturally felt she had made a wonderful
choice.  
  
"…Reni"  
  
She whispered it again.  
Her chest remained warm.  
  
"Reni"  
  
She clutched the bell she had received.  
  
—I'm so glad I met her.  
  
"Reni"  
  
Golden, round eyes. Silvery hair swaying gently, and a soft laugh.  
Just imagining that smile caused the anxiety in Carrie's heart to fade
away—  
  
"Tomorrow… what should we do for fun…"  
  
Reni would be with her until she left Reoliga City.  
If they could have more fun together in this time, that would be
great.  
  
"Reni…"  
  
She slowly closed her eyes.  
Resting peacefully against a warm chest, her consciousness slowly
faded.  
The bell in her hand didn’t ring.  
Carrie slept soundly for the first time in a long time.
