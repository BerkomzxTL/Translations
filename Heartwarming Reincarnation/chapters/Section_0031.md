# Chapter 31・Don’t Forget To Ask Questions

The moment my punch landed, Mayor Shultem was sent flying.  
He crashed into the basement wall and became embedded in it.  
It’s because he kept looking at Samyu with strange eyes.  
I snorted. Then, Samyu hesitantly spoke to me from behind.  
  
"L-Lady Reni, are you there?"  
"Uh-huh, I am."  
"Um… do you remember what we talked about in the underground
passage…?"  
"……talked about"  
  
Samyu's words brought back a memory from a little while ago, when we
were digging the underground passage to the basement.  
  
*'Lady Reni, only Shultem and those very close to him enter the
basement. Servants don't go in or out at night, so you can assume that
any man you meet in the basement is almost certainly Shultem.'*  
*'Mhm.'*  
*'I know Shultem's face, so if he's there, I'll let you know by calling
his name, so please rest assured.'*  
*'Okay.'*  
*'And, if possible, I want to extract information from Shultem.'*  
*'But, Samyu, you've already gathered a lot of information. Shultem is
bad. For Papa and Mama's sake, I'll defeat him.'*  
*'Yes, of course I agree! However… um, I'm concerned about the fact that
children were collected and sold somewhere. The information about where
they were sold, why the children were collected… I think it would be
better to get more information from him if possible.'*  
*'Understood. I'll investigate the mayor.'*  
  
……I remembered.  
  
"Wa…"  
  
And at the same time, I realized what I had done.  
I did it. I was supposed to conduct an interrogation, but I turned him
into a fossil without asking any questions…!  
  
"……despair"  
  
I'm always like this... It was the same in the game. In quests to
exterminate monsters and events, there are those with a specific number
of turns for clearing them. I’ve always failed those. How many times
have I failed an event because I defeated the enemy in two turns without
thinking, even though I knew it was supposed to take 5-10? And now,
again…  
  
"He looked at Samyu with strange eyes. I couldn't help it…"  
  
I didn't want to hear Shultem finish his sentence. I wanted him to be
quiet, so I punched him….  
I apologized with an "I'm sorry," and Samyu shook her head vigorously,
getting down on one knee.  
  
"No, really…! Information like that can be obtained however you like…!
Besides, that… Lady Reni, you… you were thinking of me, weren't you?"  
"Mhm"  
"Ngh"  
  
When I nodded, for some reason Samyu clutched her chest and convulsed
slightly.  
  
"Lady Reni cared about me… ngh, how precious…"  
  
Seeing Samyu's state, I quietly brought both hands to my hood. …See,
right now, if, by any chance, the hood comes off, I think Samyu will
faint. Since it’s come to this just from my voice alone...  
  
"Before Lady Reni's preciousness, information is like dust!"  
"Samyu…"  
  
Please calm down. Information isn't just dust.  
  
"Even if we don't get information from Shultem , I'll investigate!"  
"But, didn't you want to question Shultem too?"  
"No!"  
  
No, it's not "no." She gave a lively negative answer, but it's
absolutely wrong.  
Information from Shultem is also important.  
But now, he's become a fossil embedded in the wall…  
  
"That's right."  
  
I've got it! A great idea!  
  
"Item box"  
  
I muttered, and the item list appeared. I shifted my gaze to a familiar
item—  
  
"Confirm"  
  
With a word, a heavy weight fell on my chest.  
I caught it with both hands. What I held was—\[Recovery Potion
(Legendary)\]!  
  
"Lady Reni?"  
"I'll wake Shultem up."  
I approached Shultem, embedded in the wall, and opened the bottle’s lid.
When I was one years old, it was difficult, but as a three-year-old
equipped with items, I have no blind spots. I easily opened the lid and
splashed the contents onto Shultem. That's right! I learned in the game.
If you fail an event, just try again. And fossils can be restored.  
  
"Eh!? Eh!?"  
  
Seeing Shultem suddenly soaked, Samyu cried out in panic.  
And Shultem, who hadn't moved at all until now, let out a groan.  
  
"This is…"  
"It's a recovery potion."  
"A recovery potion…? To think such a wonderful thing exists…"  
  
Samyu was speechless.  
Yeah. As expected of \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\]. It's supposed to
be taken internally, but it works even when applied topically. Although
it proved to be effective on my father, I'm glad it worked on Shultem
too. Now I can interrogate him.  
  
"What the… how did this happen…?"  
"Because my punch hit you."  
"Wh-who…!? Where are you!?"  
"Here."  
  
I responded to Shultem's voice as he woke up and removed my hood. Now he
should be able to see me.  
Shultem, with his body buried in the wall, won't be able to move, so it
doesn't really matter if he knows where I am. I should reveal myself to
hear about the children.  
  
"Huh…? A cat beastkin child…?"  
"Why did you collect children and sell them?"  
"Wh-what are you talking about!?"  
"Don't waste words. We know you collected children and sold them
somewhere. Considering your current situation, concentrate only on
answering the questions."  
“……Ugh.”  
  
When Shultem tried to deny it, Samyu cut him off in a cold voice.
Shultem had a frustrated look on his face, but his rebellious spirit was
probably dampened by his inability to move. He began to speak slowly in
a small voice.  
  
"I was… ordered to do it."  
"Ordered?"  
"...About your age. Collect those children… especially those with
distinctive appearances or outstanding talents, that is.”  
"Who’s the client?"  
"...I don't know the details. But I was introduced by the mayor of
another big town. Selling them brings in money, and it could expand my
connections… I'm not meant to end up as a mayor of a small town like
this! I should be able to go higher!!"  
  
Shultem, who had been speaking quietly until now, suddenly started
barking.  
  
"You wouldn't understand! No matter how much you develop a town, it can
only go so far. Anything above that is leisurely occupied by bureaucrats
with connections in the royal capital, or nobles with no talent! This
was the only way for me to climb higher!!"  
"You low-down cheapskate, who abuses helpless women every night and can
only exploit children, do you really think you’re fit to climb
higher?"  
"Shut up! I'm the mayor! I'm the most important person, it's only
natural!"  
"...Foolishness."  
  
Samyu looked away, seemingly uninterested.  
And then she thanked me.  
  
"Thanks to your help, we've gathered information. The fact that they
judged it safer for this man to be uninformed suggests something big
might be moving. We also know the conditions for the children being
sold, and that it’s not limited to this town."  
"Mhm."  
"I want this man's seal. If we have that, the women he kidnapped will be
completely free, and he’ll have no choice but to resign as mayor."  
"Okay."  
"Exiting this room, go down the corridor and climb the stairs. That
leads to this man's office and private room. The seal is kept in the
private room, so let's move there."  
"Ah, wait a moment, please."  
  
I stopped Samyu as she was about to leave the room, looked into the
underground passage leading to the basement, and listened carefully.  
  
"No sound. No footsteps."  
  
The women seemed to have safely escaped the town through the underground
passage.  
No one is in the underground passage. Therefore—  
  
"Cat's Claws!"  
  
Right and left hand. I extended both claws and used a cross-cut towards
the underground passage!  
Ten gusts of wind, sliced by the claws, hit the earthen wall, collapsing
the surroundings as they advanced. The underground passage filled up
with a rumbling sound. It made a bigger sound than I expected, but it
can't be helped.  
  
"Underground passage destruction, complete."  
  
I pointed and confirmed the state of the underground passage. There's
only a mud wall there.  
  
"Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go."  
  
I hurried to Samyu’s side.  
Then Shultem, who had been watching the whole scene, cried out.  
  
"Wait… wait! …wait for me!!!"  
  
A desperate voice. I could ignore him, but I looked back slightly before
heading out the door. The moment our eyes met, Shultem swallowed hard
and forced a smile.  
  
"Hey… hey, young lady."  
  
Shultem called me in a honeyed voice.  
  
"You're very strong, aren't you, young lady? I'm quite surprised. What
do you say? How about living a life of luxury with this old man?"  
"Luxury?"  
"That's right. I'll buy you anything you want. You can eat as many
sweets as you want, and I'll get you toys. I'll give you beautiful
clothes and accessories. You're very strong, so you must want to fight
people, right?"  
"Fight?"  
"That's right! Should I prepare human men? Or a different species?
Anything is fine. I'll give you everything you want! You don't have to
do anything at all!"  
  
Shultem grew more and more vocal every time I replied.  
Maybe he thought I was interested and was desperately trying to impress
me. How easy it would be to live by Shultem's side, how easy it would be
to obtain various things.  
He'll give me anything. I can get anything.  
It certainly sounds tempting. But—  
  
"I don't like things I get from others."  
  
Right.  
  
"Reni is strong."  
  
Because I'm the strongest three-year-old.  
  
"I get what I want myself."  
  
Everything. With my own hands.  
  
"Bye-bye."  
  
I turned my back to Shultem and opened the door.  
Behind me, I could sense Shultem desperately trying to get out of the
wall, but it’s impossible for him to get out alone after being buried
like that.  
"Wait… wait for me… wait… please—"  
  
The moment I slammed the door shut, Shultem's voice disappeared.  
  
—Now, the final touch.
