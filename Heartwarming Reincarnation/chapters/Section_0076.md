# Chapter 76・My Body Doesn’t Move Well

When I came to, my junior high school self was reflected in the
mirror.  
My expressionless face mechanically tied my hair.  
My shoulder-length hair had to be tied up according to school
regulations.  
My mother, reflected in the mirror behind me, sighed and called out to
me.  
  
"Just go to school properly. Don't give me any trouble."  
"...Sorry."  
  
With that single reply, my mother sighed again and walked away.  
I slowly moved and shouldered my bag that I had left in the hallway. The
weight of the many textbooks dug into my shoulder straps.  
Putting on my shoes, I walked with my head down until I reached
school.  
The classroom, which I entered for the first time in a week, was
unchanged. I approached my desk and sat down.  
I put down my bag and searched the desk drawer, which should have been
empty. There were papers scattered inside, so I gathered them together
for the time being.  
While I was doing that, the bell rang, and class began.  
Nothing in particular happened.  
Whether I took a break or came to school, it was irrelevant to others.
School was a place to attend classes and study; I could at least do that
much.  
Just as I was thinking that, between the first and second periods,
someone spoke to me—  
  
"Hey, when you're absent, our group is one person short."  
"...Mhm."  
  
The one who spoke was a girl two numbers behind me. I remained seated at
my desk, surrounded by three girls.  
  
"Cleaning and all that stuff is troublesome. We divide up the roles, so
if you're not here, someone in our group has to do two roles. Do you
understand?"  
"...Mhm."  
  
I understood what they were saying. In our class, cleaning duties and
such were divided among groups based on attendance numbers. There were
five groups of seven, but if I’m absent, it became a group of six, which
I guess is what's causing trouble for the people in my group.  
  
"...Sorry."  
  
I managed to utter the words with my dry throat.  
I was too afraid to see their faces, so I couldn't bring myself to look
up. All I heard was a deep sigh.  
  
"It feels like I'm bullying you, so I wish you'd stop that."  
"Sorry…"  
"If you're coming, come. If you're not, just tell the teacher. Then the
teacher will know it's a group of six and adjust accordingly. We just
have trouble if they think it's still seven."  
"...Sorry."  
"I just want you to do it right."  
"...Sorry."  
  
There was a loud sigh.  
The girls moved away from my desk.  
I could hear their conversation continue from afar.  
  
"Thanks—I was really troubled, so this is a relief!"  
"Now that she'll tell the teacher, things will work out. Thanks a
lot."  
"No problem. I was troubled too."  
  
After that, I couldn't concentrate on classes... My stomach felt
heavy…  
Nevertheless, I somehow finished the day's classes, when the teacher
called me.  
  
"Could you come to the staff room after school?"  
"...Yes."  
  
I don’t want to go. But maybe I can talk to her about what happened
today.  
Because I'm causing trouble for the group, I'd like my role to be
lightened.  
So, enduring the heaviness in my stomach, I headed to the staff room.  
The teacher let me in and I went to their desk. They looked up at me,
still standing.  
  
"You shouldn't miss school."  
"...I’m Sorry."  
"You'll fall behind in your studies and can't do your class duties."  
"I'm... sorry..."  
"I'm not angry, you know. Just come to school regularly and do your best
in class."  
  
My stomach... hurt. My head... throbbed.  
  
"Come to school properly from tomorrow on."  
  
Saying that, the teacher sent me out of the staff room.  
In the end, I couldn't talk about lightening the burden on the other
members of my group…  
I shouldered my heavy bag and headed home with my head down.  
  
"Go to school properly…"  
  
Just that. Something everyone can do. Something that's expected.  
If I just went to school, no one would be troubled, right?  
  
"God…"  
  
God. God. God.  
I want to do my best. I always think that if I could just do my best,
everything would be fine.  
But—  
  
"...I can't."  
  
I don't understand what's normal. I can't do what's expected.  
Today, in every conversation I had, I couldn't reply with anything other
than "sorry."  
  
"I'm tired…"  
  
All day, I was tense. All day, I apologized.  
Even though I haven't done anything, I no longer have the energy to
move.  
Still in my uniform, I burrowed into my bed and closed my eyes.  
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and forever. I’ll have to live
apologizing every time I interact with others, and I have to live
blaming myself for my inability.  
I was being swallowed by a dark, swirling vortex.  
Then, I heard a voice from far away—  
  
"—ni, Lady Reni!"  
  
A desperate voice. The one being called, in a tear-filled voice—was my
name.  
Then, light flooded the dark vortex.  
  
"Reni is amazing! You can do anything!"  
"...Papa"  
  
Saying that, he hugged me tightly.  
My small perspective rose, and the view from here looked
extraordinary.  
  
"Reni, I love you."  
"...Mama…"  
  
She laughed softly and gently stroked my head.  
The warmth of her hand resting on my small head. The warmth I felt from
her hand soothed my heart.  
  
"Lady Reni! Here! Here!! Please don't disappear…!"  
"Reni, over here. Come back!"  
  
More clearly than before, I heard desperate voices. This time there were
two.  
I want to answer those voices, but I don't know how.  
  
"Arghh! If this continues, she'll disappear along with the \[Jewel\]!
Free me! Leave it to me!"  
  
Another different voice, and then a jolt ran through my chest.  
  
"Here. Focus your awareness here."  
  
A clear voice.  
Following the words, I focused my awareness on my chest, and there was a
great light…  
  
"Do you love this world?"  
"Mhm."  
"Do you love these people?"  
"Mhm."  
"Then, don't dissipate your power. Concentrate on it."  
"Concentrate…"  
"Gather the light."  
  
When I looked closely after hearing that, I could see the light steadily
overflowing outward.  
Like this... um, making it into a tight, round shape...  
  
"That's it. Keep going."  
  
Finally, apply a firm pressure to gather the light into a sphere.  
In that moment, my eyes snapped open.  
"Ah, I see."  
  
The first thing I saw was a dragon girl. Black hair and purple eyes.  
Behind her was a crying Samyu and a worried looking Hasano.  
  
"L-L-Lady Reniii, I'm so glad!"  
  
Samyu hugged me tightly.  
It’s so strong it hurts. That strength seemed to reflect Samyu's
feelings.  
  
"Reni, what happened?"  
  
Hmm? I tilted my head.  
I know I saw something from my junior high school days that wasn't a
good memory. But everyone's reaction was desperate.  
To my confusion, Hasano continued with a pained look in her eyes.  
  
"Just now, Reni used too much power, and was on the verge of
disappearing due to a \[Mana Rampage\]."
