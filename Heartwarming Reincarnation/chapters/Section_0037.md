# Chapter 37・Time for Some Recovery Potions

"Then, please stay in Reoliga City. I'll contact you."  
  
The girl, her cheeks still flushed, said only that much before returning
to the other women.  
  
"You did it! You really did it, Your Highness!"  
"Your Highness…Your Highness spoke with someone of the same age…"  
"Your Highness!"  
"T-this much is only natural! More importantly, we need to report the
situation here and contact Reoliga City for help for the soldiers. Who's
the fastest? We need to hurry…"  
  
Apparently, the girl is trying to contact Reoliga City to get help for
the soldiers. Everyone must be in a terrible state after being blown
away by the dragon.  
  
"Help."  
"Eh…?"  
"Leave it to Reni."  
  
I puffed out my chest and nodded vigorously to reassure her.  
  
"Samyu, please bring the injured people."  
"Yes. I can do that…but it's dangerous for Lady Reni's abilities to be
known to people…"  
"Don’t worry. I'm a cat now."  
  
That's right! Since I just fought a dragon, I'm wearing the \[Cat's Paw
Gloves\]. Right now, I'm a cat beastgirl. My disguise is perfect!  
  
"…Understood."  
"Mhm. Please."  
  
Samyu thought for a moment. After a resigned laugh, she immediately
turned around. I also started to act!  
  
"Wait for me."  
  
Calling out to the girl, I put some distance between us. I went to the
other side of a tree that blocked the girl's view, crouched down, and
muttered to myself.  
  
"Item Box"  
  
Many items appeared. I selected the \[Recovery Potion (Exceptional)\],
\[Recovery Potion (Superior)\], and \[Recovery Potion (Average)\].  
I’m sure I could take them all out at once, but knowing myself, I'd
definitely spill them. No doubt about it.  
So, carefully choosing one at a time, I held each one that appeared
before my chest and put it down on the ground.  
  
"One, two, three…this side is exceptional, this side is superior…"  
  
I put them down while separating them into categories.  
How many do I need? About 20 should be enough, right?  
  
"Ah, for the horses."  
  
I'll heal the horse, too.  
  
"Twenty-one, twenty-two…thirty!"  
  
Glass bottles neatly lined up on the ground. Separated into exceptional,
superior, and average, and it’s quite a sight.  
  
"Lady Reni, here are the first two people."  
  
Samyu came over to me, carrying a soldier on each shoulder.  
Yeah, Samyu is strong.  
  
"Thank you. Please lay them down there."  
"Yes. …Still, as expected of Lady Reni. It’s rare to see such a large
number of highly effective recovery potions lined up. Are they separated
because they have different effects?"  
"Mhm. There are ones that work really well and ones that are ordinary. I
sorted them so that they can be used depending on the injury."  
"I see, that’s efficient. Once I’ve finished carrying the soldiers, I’ll
help distribute the potions."  
"Please. And later heal the horses too."  
"Understood."  
  
After finishing her conversation with me, Samyu left again. It must be
difficult to find the blown-away soldiers and horses and bring those
with serious injuries, but I can leave it to Samyu.  
So, I took a \[Recovery Potion (Exceptional)\] and approached the
soldier who was lying down.  
  
"Are you alright?"  
"…"  
"Can you hear me? Can you feel me touching you?"  
"…"  
  
…Hmm. There's no reaction. This looks pretty dangerous. It would have
been good if they could drink the potion, but that seems difficult.  
Then—  
  
"Item Box"  
  
I put the \[Recovery Potion (Exceptional)\] I was holding to my chest
down on the ground and chose a \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\]
instead.  
Yep. The fact that I kept showering recovery potions on my father will
come in handy here too. A blessing in disguise!  
  
"It'll be cold, but please bear with it."  
  
I poured the opened \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\] over the soldier.
He's soaking wet, but please forgive me. He'll be healed.  
  
"What are you doing!?"  
  
The girl cried out at my actions. Well, it is surprising.  
She hurried to my side and knelt beside the soldier.  
The drenched soldier groaned, "Ugh…"—  
  
"Your Highness…? "  
"Yes. How are you feeling?"  
"Ah, I apologize for the shameful display."  
"It’s fine. More importantly, how’s your body? Are you hurting
anywhere?"  
"Yes…I feel a little fatigued."  
"Despite being seriously injured, you’re only tired…We’re setting up
camp now, so please rest there."  
"Yes."  
  
The soldier, who seemed to have regained consciousness, looked at the
girl and tried to hastily adjust his position, but the girl stopped
him.  
And then, looking at me—  
  
"You’re amazing."  
"Mhm. Reni’s amazing."  
  
Her brown eyes were wide with surprise, so I laughed softly.  
  
"Next one. Please handle the healed soldiers."  
"Understood!"  
  
Leaving the rest to the girl, I moved on to the next soldier.  
He seems to be somewhat conscious, so I had him drink a \[Recovery
Potion (Exceptional)\]. His body healed instantly, and the soldier was
surprised, but thanks to the girl’s words, he quickly calmed down.  
In this way, I continued having Samyu bring the soldiers, giving them
recovery potions, and having the girl speak to the healed ones.  
After the soldiers were healed, I poured or had the horses drink
recovery potions as well, and then—  
  
"Everyone's healthy!"  
*'OOO’*  
  
The soldiers, with whom I became friends while healing them, responded
to my call.  
Good, good. The horses are healthy too!  
  
"You helped us so much."  
"Mhm. It's okay."  
  
The girl stared intently at me. I nodded reassuringly.  
  
"We’re leaving now, but are you sure you don't want to come with us?"  
"Reni won’t ride a horse. I’ll walk."  
  
I need to build muscle!  
  
"Is that so…I understand. Then, um…"  
  
My answer clearly disappointed the girl. Then, for some reason, her eyes
darted around nervously.  
  
"Um…again."  
"Mhm."  
"Again! Definitely! Let's meet again!"  
"We'll have a tea party, right?"  
"Yes!"  
"See you later."  
"Yes!!"  
  
The girl smiled with genuine joy. Since she had kept glaring at me or
had a stern look, it made me very happy to see her smile like that.  
The girl and the women got on their horses, and I waved to them.  
  
"I'll contact you soon!"  
"Mhm."  
  
The girl looked back at me several times before heading towards Reoliga
City.  
  
"Samyu, let's go too."  
"Yes."  
"I’ll give walking my all."  
"Yes."  
  
I took off my \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and \[Winged Rabbit Boots\] and held
hands with Samyu. It was a busy day dealing with a dragon, healing
soldiers, and making a tea party promise with the girl, but it's all
settled!  
  
"I wonder why the dragon targeted the carriage…"  
  
In the refreshing breeze, Samyu muttered worriedly.
