# Chapter 32・Mission Accomplished

Leaving the basement, I walked down the hallway. At the end of the
hallway was a spiral staircase. Going up, I arrived at Shultem's private
room.  
The private room was furnished with high-quality furniture and fluffy
carpets. ...Hmm. It seems a little too extravagant for a mayor. There's
gold ornamentation everywhere, and the furnishings are unnecessarily
shiny. It's easy to see that he’s a nouveau riche.  
While I was looking around the overly shiny room, Samyu approached the
desk in front of the window. She reached for the top drawer.  
Probably, the seal is in there. But, although the drawer made a rattling
sound, it wouldn't open.  
  
"It's locked."  
"Reni will open it."  
  
"Leave it to me," I said, thumping my chest and approaching the desk.
Then I inserted a claw of the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] into the keyhole.  
  
"Unlock."  
  
With those words, the keyhole clicked.  
  
"Samyu, it's open."  
"Amazing... Lady Reni truly can do anything. Thank you."  
  
Samyu lets out a sigh of admiration and opened the drawer. I peered into
the open drawer as well. Inside, there were several documents, some
seals, and a strange red crystal ball.  
"Samyu, what's this?"  
  
I pointed to the red crystal and looked up at Samyu.  
Samyu seems curious about the red crystal as well, and she tilted her
head quizzically.  
  
"It's a magical tool... I think it's safe to pick up."  
  
Samyu picked up the red crystal.  
Then, she stared at it intently. Her blue eyes gleamed—  
  
"I just channeled my mana to investigate it. It seems to be a kind of
switch; it operates when it's aligned with something."  
"A switch... Ah, is it over there?"  
  
I looked around the room. In the gold-glittering room, there's only one
spot with a red light.  
I spotted it at the exit of the spiral staircase we used to come up from
the basement. The wall was inlaid with stones and glowed red. The center
surrounded by the red stones is recessed, and the red crystal looks like
it would fit perfectly.  
  
"Yes. I'll investigate a little."  
"Reni will hold the crystal."  
"Thank you."  
  
I received the red crystal from Samyu. After handing it to me, Samyu
approached the red stone wall and placed her hand on it. Her blue eyes
shined brightly again, so she must be channeling mana.  
Samyu continued investigating, but after a few seconds, her face clouded
over.  
  
"...Lady Reni. This seems to be a mechanism for destroying the
passageway leading to the basement."  
"Destroy the passageway?"  
"Yes. ...They gather women and confine them to the basement... If
anything happens, they would seal the passageway and pretend nothing
happened... That's surely what it's for."  
  
Samyu furrowed her brow, looking uncomfortable. Still, she explained it
to me, a three-year-old, in a voice as emotionally restrained as
possible.  
I nodded in understanding at Samyu's explanation.  
Shultem used Slanita Finance to gather women. Naturally, he knew that
human trafficking is illegal and that it would be bad if he was found
out. That's why this device exists.  
If something unfavorable were to happen to him, he intended to
immediately collapse the passageway and bury the women alive.  
The women confined in the basement couldn't call for help and would be
buried, impossible for anyone to find.  
Use them conveniently, dispose of them conveniently. That's Shultem's
way.  
Then—  
  
"Because it's his own mechanism."  
  
The recessed center surrounded by red stones. It's about waist-high for
an adult, so I can reach it. I fit the red crystal into it.  
Instantly, the red light intensified, and something started to move with
a rumbling sound—  
  
"Become a fossil!"  
  
As I spoke, the red light flashed intensely. It only took a few seconds.
The red light disappeared in an instant, and the passage where the
spiral staircase should have been was gone.  
Shultem is now buried in the basement wall. He couldn't escape on his
own, but with a passageway to the basement, someone could have found
him. But that passageway is now sealed by his own device. It's truly his
own doing!  
I exhaled softly through my nose.  
And, a few seconds later…  
  
"I... did it again..."  
  
I suddenly realized.  
Although Shultem is corrupt, he is the mayor. The mayor governs the
town... I guess I shouldn't have turned him into a fossil...? I'm always
like this. I don't think about the consequences.  
  
"Samyu,... what was the plan after this?"  
  
Is it because of me that the plan is messed up?  
I looked up at Samyu nervously.  
But, contrary to my expectations, Samyu didn't look angry or surprised,
but was nodding vigorously.  
  
"After this, we'll first put the seal on these documents and free the
women. I've already sent the evidence of human trafficking, illicit
funds, and the documents regarding the mayor's misconduct to the
kingdom, domain, and city governments, so they should be acting. Shultem
will be immediately disciplined, and a new mayor will be selected."  
"Mmn"  
"Also, having seen Lady Reni's achievements at Slanita Finance, I've
prepared a resignation form to ensure there will be no problems even if
Shultem disappears."  
"... Even if Shultem disappears, it won't be a problem?"  
"Yes. We can handle it by saying that he left the town of his own accord
out of fear of his crimes being exposed."  
  
...Samyu!!  
Reliable...! Incredibly reliable!!  
  
"Samyu, you're amazing!"  
"That's too kind..."  
  
As I looked up at her with respect, Samyu's cheeks turned red with
embarrassment.  
And then she muttered to herself.  
  
"Besides... He gazed upon Lady Reni's visage. Even if Lady Reni hadn't
done it, eventually..."  
"Hm?"  
"No, it's nothing. I'll get to work, please wait a moment."  
"Mhm."  
  
After saying that, Samyu returned to the desk and stamped the documents
she brought.  
Now the women are officially free, and shouldn’t have any problems in
the future.  
  
"Well then, Lady Reni, let's go."  
"Mhm."  
  
After finishing her work, Samyu placed several documents on the desk and
pressed them down with a weight. Then, she spread her arms toward me.  
This is a "come here" signal. It seems she'll carry me.  
I put away the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and \[Winged Rabbit Boots\] I was
equipped with into my item box and pulled my hood deep over my head.  
...If I don't wear the hood, Samyu will faint.  
After getting ready, I jumped towards Samyu.  
  
"Samyu, can I hold you now?"  
"U-ugh, ugh... Yes, I suppose so. If I can't see your appearance, then
this overwhelming affection might just be..."  
  
Samyu hugged me gently, took a few deep breaths, and then approached the
window. Apparently, she's going to escape through the window.  
  
"This will bring peace to this town and the surrounding villages."  
"Mhm. Now Papa and Mama are safe."  
  
Even after I leave on my journey.  
My father and mother will be able to live happily ever after.  
  
"Mission complete!"  
  
I saluted smartly while being held by Samyu.  
  
—Reni Shurm Guora (3). First objective achieved!
