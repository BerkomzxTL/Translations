# Chapter 102・I'm Back

When I woke up, I found myself in a place where trees sparkled like
jewels.  
It seems I’ve returned to \[The Forest of Reflection\].  
  
“I’m back.”  
  
I opened my eyes and sat up.  
Then, someone hugged me tightly.  
  
“Little Reni! I’m so glad! I’m so glad!!”  
“Karigano.”  
  
She seemed worried, her hug a little too strong.  
I patted her on the back to calm her down. She let out a relieved “feeh”
and loosened her grip slightly.  
  
“What happened to Reni?”  
“Little Reni saw a \[Doppelganger\] and collapsed. Then, a black vortex
and lots of light poured out of Little Reni’s chest.”  
  
I nodded at Karigano’s words.  
From what I heard, something amazing definitely happened.  
The \[Human Shadow\] looked like me from my time in Japan, and it shook
me. I must have also remembered some unpleasant memories.  
  
“Reni, mana went berserk…”  
  
I had been training and collecting treasures to prevent this…  
I slumped my shoulders, disheartened by my failure.  
Then, I heard a familiar voice.  
  
*‘…sorry.’*  
  
I turned sharply.  
There—  
  
*‘I’m sorry. I didn’t think I’d surprise you so much… I’m sorry.’*  
  
Black hair, black eyes. My “Japanese self,” in a matching black
sweatsuit top and bottom, peeked at me anxiously. Her dark eyes trembled
nervously.  
If I were to look at my Japanese self in a mirror, it would be exactly
like this.  
This is the \[Human Shadow\]. It’s only mimicking my appearance, not the
real me. But its expression, tone, and hushed voice… Everything is just
like my Japanese self.  
Seeing that, the words came out easily.  
  
“It’s okay.”  
  
There’s no need to be so scared, it’ll be alright.  
I hated the failing me, the rejected me, the irritable me, the
bothersome me. I was sad about that self, and I wanted to become someone
different.  
  
“Reni, failed. Even though I tried not to fail, I still did.”  
  
…Since being reborn into this world. Reaching max level, carrying over
items. Receiving so much love from my father and mother, and so much
kindness from Samyu.  
Everyone I met on my journey showed me so many things.  
But I make mistakes.  
This time, I almost destroyed the world.  
  
“Reni isn’t perfect.”  
  
The \[Human Shadow\], wearing my Japanese self’s appearance.  
I stood up and gently approached it.  
  
“…No one’s perfect.”  
  
I stood before the \[Human Shadow\] and looked up.  
My high school self is taller than I am now. I hugged her tightly around
the waist.  
  
“—It’s okay.”  
  
Just as I am. As much as I can be.  
If I can forgive myself… surely, that'll be enough.  
  
*‘Hmm. That's a good answer.’*  
  
That voice was no longer that of my Japanese self.  
Her form wavered, then transformed into a transparent distortion. The
body I had been hugging disappeared, and before I knew it, there was
nothing in front of me…  
  
“It disappeared.”  
  
I put my hands down and looked around.  
There was no trace of the transparent distortion. Instead, something was
placed on the ground.  
  
“A hand mirror?”  
“That must be the \[Human Shadow\]’s treasure! Little Reni got it
without a fight…! Amazing!”  
  
Karigano cheered, "Wow!"  
And then—  
  
“Lady Reni!”  
“Oi, wait, wait a minute…! Seriously!”  
  
Two voices descended from the sky.  
Two figures. One of them fell towards me.  
It seems Samyu had jumped from Hamu, who had been fluttering in the
air.  
Samyu used \[Mana Manipulation\], landing on the ground with a \*shuta\*
sound. Then, seeing me, she breathed a sigh of relief.  
Her golden hair swayed in the breeze, her blue eyes gently gazing at
me.  
When our eyes met, the next thing I knew I found myself running…  
  
“Samyu!”  
  
And then, I kicked off the ground. With a leap, I landed in Samyu’s
arms.  
  
“L-Lady Reni…?”  
  
Samyu’s voice was flustered. Even then, she still held me firmly.  
I hugged her tightly once, as if to confirm her existence.  
Then, I relaxed, staring intently into her beautiful blue eyes.  
Samyu seemed overwhelmed, her cheeks flushed with surprise.  
I reached up and gave her a kiss on her cheek.  
  
“Hinya… !?”  
  
At that moment, a squeaking sound escaped Samyu, but I ignored it and
continued to gaze into her eyes.  
Because I want to convey this feeling.  
  
“Samyu, I love you.”  
  
Did it get through? My feelings.  
Did it reach her?  
  
“Samyu, I love you.”  
  
Maybe once wasn't enough, so I said it again.  
This time, no squeaking sound came out, and it must have gotten through…
I think? Eh?  
  
“…Samyu?”  
“She fainted while standing!! And she's got a goofy grin on her face!!
…Scary!!"  
“As expected of the young elf. You tried to end her life."  
“…I didn’t.”  
  
Samyu was standing, unconscious with her eyes rolled back, but with a
blissful expression.
