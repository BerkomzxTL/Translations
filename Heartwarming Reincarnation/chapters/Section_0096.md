# Chapter 96・Versus \[Poisonous Chicken\]!

Entering the miasma, I carried my \[Pickaxe (Exceptional)\] and headed
towards the center. Since I’m wearing the \[Hermit's Robe\] with my hood
up, my presence shouldn't be detected.  
The miasma is murky, and it’s impossible to see ahead.  
I didn't want to be noticed by getting too close to the center, so I
stopped at a reasonable distance and began digging.  
According to Karigano, the \[Cockatrice\] is about the size of a
single-family house.  
My goal is to dig a hole large enough to completely bury that massive
body. As I plunged the pickaxe into the sand, it chipped away neatly
into a perfect square with a pop-pop sound. Normally, no matter how much
you dig in desert sand, it would immediately fill back in, but this
\[Pickaxe (Exceptional)\] is amazing. Not only does it dig deep, it
doesn't collapse.  
I reminisced about digging underground passages like this when I went to
Mayor Shultem's mansion.  
  
"Depth, good. Size, good."  
  
Looking up at the sky from the bottom of the hole, I pointed and
confirmed.  
This should be plenty big enough to contain the \[Poisonous Chicken\]'s
body.  
So, I hopped out of the hole and finally headed towards the center of
the miasma. Visibility was poor due to the miasma. But it gradually came
into view—  
  
"Waow…! This is...a Cockatrice..."  
  
—Purple feathers and a bright red comb. Its lower legs transitioned into
green scales, and it had a long tail.  
It's probably about 10 meters tall. It somehow gives the impression of
what a dinosaur would look like, I think.  
It seemed to be asleep, its legs folded, crouched on the ground.  
I approached the \[Poisonous Chicken\] and promptly took off my hood.  
  
"Cockatrice."  
  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\] seemed startled by my voice and opened its
eyes in surprise. Its red eyes glinted as they found me. Then, quickly
standing up, it extended its sharp talons from its hind legs towards me.
I see, it’s a kick.  
  
"It won’t hit."  
  
I jumped back to avoid it. The \[Poisonous Chicken\] didn't seem to
expect me to dodge, and for a moment its eyes widened. Then, it ruffled
its feathers and lowered its head.  
Looking at the \[Poisonous Chicken\]'s hind legs, it seemed to be firmly
digging its claws into the sand. This is...  
  
"Charge!"  
  
Knowing the \[Poisonous Chicken\]'s movement, I leaped to the right. The
\[Poisonous Chicken\] ran straight to where I had been, plunging its
sharp beak into the ground. It seems to be combining a charge with a
peck.  
It didn't seem to be very agile, and it couldn't keep up with my
\[Jump\].  
And with this attack, my plan should work!  
  
"Where are you looking? Over here!"  
  
As I learned with the \[Naga\], some monsters understand human speech.
The Earth Dragon that attacked Carrie seemed to understand Gaillard.  
So, a \[Poisonous Chicken\], which seems to be about as strong, should
be able to understand what I’m saying.  
In other words, if I provoke it like this...  
  
*'Gweh!'*  
  
Its red eyes glowed even more intensely.  
Yes, it's angry. Suddenly appearing and disturbing its sleep, then being
spoken to like this, of course it would be angry.  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\] lowered its head again, putting force into its
hind legs. This time, it scratched the sand with its hind legs,
seemingly gathering strength for a more powerful charge.  
It stared intently at me, aiming. And then—  
  
*'Gweeeeh!!'*  
  
With a roar, it charged towards me.  
Having gathered its strength, it was faster than the first time. Not
only that, but a surge of miasma erupted from its body.  
I guess the \[Poisonous Chicken\]'s fighting style is to blow away
enemies immobilized by the miasma with a charge.  
But miasma has no effect on me. Furthermore, if the charge comes
straight at me, I just need to jump and dodge.  
I can dodge it every time.  
That's why I waited in place until the last moment right before the
\[Poisonous Chicken\]'s charge would hit me.  
  
—It's going to hit.  
  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\] must have thought so. Immobilized by the
miasma, I would become a target.  
Its red eyes narrowed into a smile of victory. But, too sweet!  
  
"Jump!"  
  
After fully drawing the \[Poisonous Chicken\]'s attention, I jumped
back.  
Then—  
  
*'Kweh?'*  
  
—The \[Poisonous Chicken\], caught up in its momentum, fell into the
hole with a dumbfounded expression.  
  
"Got it!"  
  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\] fell into the hole I dug, of course. I had
been standing right at the edge, luring it in.  
Having jumped to the opposite edge, I pointed at the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]. If it just fell into the hole, it'd be able to escape. So…!  
  
"Sand! Sand, sand, sand, sand, sand!"  
  
I aimed for the area around its neck and continuously took sand out of
my item box. Then, the neatly cut squares of sand were placed down,
isolating the \[Poisonous Chicken\]'s head from its body.  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\], which never expected to find a hole in the
middle of the desert and fall into it, was stunned. Just as it seemed to
finally realize its neck was getting constricted. It was too late!  
  
*'Gweh…! Gweeeeh!!'*  
  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\] tried to flap its large wings to escape the
hole. However, its body from the neck down was already buried in sand.  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\], desperately trying to escape, roared and
thrashed its head. It was probably also flapping its wings and kicking
beneath the sand. But...  
  
*'Kweh...Kuu...'*  
  
Struggling was futile. In fact, the more it thrashed in that
quicksand-like pit, the deeper it became buried in sand. It seemed to
realize this, and the \[Poisonous Chicken\] stopped roaring, hanging its
head dejectedly.  
  
"Capture, success!"  
  
Perfect…! A perfect capture operation…!  
I was so pleased with how it turned out that I unconsciously exclaimed,
"Waow!"  
After all, the best way to capture a large monster is to set a trap and
lure it in!  
The \[Poisonous Chicken\], which gathers and disperses miasma around it,
would cause too much miasma damage if fought normally. That's why I
decided to trap it and stop its movement like this.  
I remembered in the game, there were times when I had to set traps to
defeat large monsters. There was information floating around online
about using architecture to make traps specifically for those
monsters.  
In any case, the \[Poisonous Chicken\] is now unable to move or
escape.  
And I still have a secret weapon!  
At this rate, Samyu and Karigano won't be able to get here. The miasma
is too thick.  
  
"Eliminate the miasma."  
  
After catching the \[Poisonous Chicken\], the next step is to eliminate
this miasma. If the miasma disappears, Samyu and Karigano will be able
to get closer.  
The method is—  
  
"Recovery potion, shower!"  
  
—To sprinkle the \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\] on the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]'s body!
