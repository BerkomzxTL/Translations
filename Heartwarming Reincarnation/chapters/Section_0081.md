# Chapter 81・I Will Practice Discipline

After that, Samyu’s eyes rolled back as usual and collapsed. It's scary
that it's become her usual state, but this is her usual.  
Her face looked happy, so it must have been good that we talked…
right?  
Two seconds later, Samyu revived, with her eyes rolling back, and, with
a sharp look, said, "I must let Lady Reni rest," before carrying me to
bed. With my worries gone, I was able to sleep soundly.  
  
Then, the next day.  
I received the spell from Hasano again.  
Just like the first time, the fever and lethargy disappeared
immediately. Now, I need to be able to use \[Mana Manipulation\] to
maintain this.  
What I will do is—  
  
"Training!"  
  
The path for me, who is already the strongest, to become even
stronger…！  
  
"Now, Reni. Let's try \[Mana Manipulation\]."  
"Mhm!"  
  
Exciting \[Mana Manipulation\]!  
In the large hall where a magic circle had been drawn for the spell to
thin out the \[Mana Pathways\], Hasano nodded to an elf waiting by the
door.  
Then, that elf brought a cart carrying something to us.  
What was on the cart was…a lot of thread?  
The base color was probably white. But it strangely shone with seven
colors; it’s very beautiful.  
  
"It's made from silk thread taken from the cocoons of rainbow silkworms,
silkworms that only exist in the Elven Forest."  
"Silk thread."  
"Yes. It's called 'Magic Silk Thread', and it can conduct mana."  
  
I nodded thoughtfully at Hasano's explanation.  
This information wasn't in the game, but perhaps this thread was used in
clothing equipment with high magic defense. I think there was a
seven-colored effect.  
Hasano smiled at me and picked up several strands of magic silk thread
in her hands.  
Then—  
  
"Look."  
"Whaaa"  
  
—The thread floated in the air and was woven together…！  
Seeing the finished braid, I let out a cheer.  
The thread…moved on its own!!  
  
"Amazing…!"  
"This is also possible, you know?"  
  
Hasano picked up more magic silk thread. Then, the thread floated into
the air, separating from Hasano's hand. Each thread moved as if it had
its own will, weaving and knitting.  
What was made was….  
  
"A ribbon!"  
"I'll give this to Reni."  
  
A flat-woven ribbon shining in seven colors.  
Receiving it from Hasano, it's truly silk. So smooth and wonderfully
comfortable.  
  
"Young elves learn how to convey and manipulate mana using this magic
silk thread. Samyu, do you remember?"  
"I…may have…."  
"Magic silk thread practice was a hundred years ago for Samyu, so her
memory is hazy. Samyu focused on running, swordsmanship, and archery to
increase physical enhancement through \[Mana Manipulation\]…"  
"Strength is power."  
  
Samyu….  
  
"Now, Reni, give it a try. I think it would be best to start by being
able to tie a simple knot with one strand of thread."  
"Mhm!"  
  
I wonder if I can do it.  
  
"I'll try."  
  
First, I took a strand of magic silk thread. Mhm, yes, this much is
fine.  
  
"Gently let the mana flow."  
"Mhm."  
"Then, imagine moving the thread through air."  
"Mhm."  
  
Letting mana flow is probably the same feeling as when I purified the
entire city of Reoliga or extinguishing the flames in the Elven Forest.
I still don't quite understand moving the thread in the air yet, but
I'll try it out first!  
Closing my eyes, I gathered the heat inside my body. Then, I imagined
moving it to my fingertips—  
  
"R-Reni!? Wait!?  
"Lady Reni!"  
"Eh?"  
  
I can hear Hasano and Samyu's flustered voices.  
I involuntarily opened my eyes, and surprisingly the magic silk thread I
was holding was shining in seven vibrant colors.  
  
"Let go!"  
  
Around the same time as Hasano's voice, I hurriedly let go of the
thread.  
Then, a rainbow-colored light radiated from the magic silk thread.
And—  
  
"A.h"  
  
—Boof!!  
  
"The thread…"  
"Exploded…"  
"It exploded."  
  
We all looked at each other.  
Before even manipulating the thread in the air, I couldn't even get the
mana to flow through the thread….  
Hasano and Samyu had surprised looks on their faces, so I guess normally
the magic silk thread shouldn't explode.  
It seems they didn't expect me to get stuck here.  
  
"Let's try again."  
"Yes… perhaps a smaller amount would be better."  
"Lady Reni, if you feel danger, please let go immediately, just like
before!"  
"Mhm."  
  
Following Hasano and Samyu's advice, I took another strand of magic silk
thread from the cart.  
This time…I closed my eyes while imagining a slightly smaller amount. I
gathered just a little of the heat in my chest to my fingertips—  
  
"L-Lady Reni!"  
"Let go!"  
  
With their anxious voices, I opened my eyes and released the magic silk
thread.  
And sure enough—Boof!  
  
"…Despair."  
  
It exploded again….  
\[Mana Manipulation\], unexpectedly, I stumbled at the very first
step.  
  
"Normally, magic silk thread wouldn't explode so easily with mana. Is
Reni's mana just too immense…?"  
  
My shoulders fell dejectedly.  
But…it's okay! Things don't always go well from the start. Even in
games, you fail and try again and again to get better!  
  
"Won't give up."  
  
I took a strand of magic silk thread from the cart and concentrated
again. This time, I imagined an even smaller amount…but it exploded
again. So, I picked up the magic silk thread again.  
  
"As expected… As expected, Lady Reni! I am now taking in Lady Reni's
magnificence throughout my body. I must also become stronger!"  
  
After saying that, Samyu nodded vigorously at me.  
  
"If Lady Reni aims for even greater heights, I must leap with her. I'll
go run!"  
"Mhm."  
  
Samyu, saying that, then turned to Hasano.  
Hasano looked at both of us with a smile.  
  
"Queen Hasano, please take care of Lady Reni."  
"Yes, it's alright. I'll make sure Reni doesn't get into any danger."  
  
Samyu looked at me with eyes full of determination.  
So, I gave a thumbs up and nodded.  
  
"Let's get stronger."  
"Yes!"  
  
Samyu rushed out of the large hall.  
Her blue eyes sparkled, and she looked very strong as she looked
forward.  
  
"…It seems Samyu is okay now."  
"Samyu?"  
"Yes… She seemed troubled, but I can tell that the two of you found the
answer together."  
  
Apparently, Hasano had also noticed that Samyu was feeling down.  
Hasano bent down in front of me and met my eyes.  
  
"Reni is amazing."  
"Reni just talked."  
"That's not easy to do."  
  
Hasano patted my head gently.  
Closing my eyes comfortably, Hasano laughed along with me.  
And then, with an "Okay!", she stood up.  
  
"Now, Reni. To control your enormous amounts of mana, you seem to need
the ability to control even smaller amounts. —Let's try various
things."
