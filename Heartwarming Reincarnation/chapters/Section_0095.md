# Chapter 95・It's \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\]

The next morning, we said goodbye to Hamu and greeted the villagers.  
Samyu and I, along with the newly added Karigano, moved around by
jumping.  
I’m wearing the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\], so instead of a leisurely journey
on foot, I'm traveling in a hurry.  
Karigano is truly a beastkin. She easily kept pace with me in my
equipped items and Samyu using her \[Mana Manipulation\].  
After five days of staying overnight in towns and villages along the
way, it finally appeared before my eyes—  
  
“Waow…!”  
  
—\[The Ever-Shifting Desert\]!  
Sand, sand, sand… Everything is sand! Everything I could see was
reddish-brown, fine sand…!  
I had felt the dryness of the air as we approached, but there had been
trees and firm ground. But now, the landscape before me was entirely
made of fine sand.  
The difference from the deserts I’d seen in videos before my
reincarnation is probably the color. I often saw sand in a
yellowish-brown color, but the sand here has a much stronger reddish
hue.  
  
“Ah, is this the boundary?”  
  
And the boundary was much clearer than I expected.  
I had imagined it would gradually become a desert, but here, it suddenly
became sandy.  
As I pondered this, Samyu nodded with interest.  
  
“This is my first time seeing \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\], but the
boundary is surprisingly clear.”  
“That’s right! The desert is the footprint of where the \[Cockatrice\]
roams!”  
“Cockatrice?”  
  
I tilted my head at Karigano’s words  
Karigano nodded and continued.  
  
“I told you the chicken is cloaked in miasma. That miasma withers any
plants and trees that come into contact with it. This is dry land, so
once the plants are gone, it becomes a desert. It would be fine if it
stayed in one place, but because the chicken wanders around, the desert
spreads.”  
“I see.”  
“It means the chicken's miasma reached this border in the past. If the
chicken leaves, the plants will slowly return. Karigano's village also
plants trees from time to time to prevent the desert from spreading!”  
  
I nodded in understanding.  
The poison miasma of the \[Cockatrice\] seems quite powerful. Just as
Hamu said.  
  
“I can tell where it is by the smell of the chicken’s poison. But that's
it…”  
“The miasma is poisonous to living beings. We can’t get too close to the
\[Cockatrice\], which is covered in it.”  
  
Karigano and Samyu stared into the depths of the desert.  
Karigano probably already knows the \[Poisonous Chicken\]’s location.
But if we can’t approach it, we can’t defeat it.  
Just like with the \[Naga\], if it has a treasure inside, I can't just
blow it away from a distance with my \[Cat's Claws\].  
As Hamu said, it truly is a formidable enemy.  
But—  
  
“I can approach the Cockatrice.”  
“Fweh?!”  
  
When I said this confidently, Karigano exclaimed in surprise.  
  
“But it’s dangerous! If a living thing breathes in the miasma, it’ll
collapse. You’ll need an antidote immediately!”  
“Mhm. But I won't get poisoned.”  
“Really?!”  
  
Karigano blinked rapidly at my words.  
Then, Samyu nodded, saying, “I see.”  
  
“Lady Reni must have a special item.”  
“Hamu gave it to me.”  
“From the dragon?”  
“Mhm. This.”  
  
Just as Samyu said, the reason I won’t be affected by the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]’s miasma is because I have a ‘special item.’  
And that item is—  
  
“Is it an inverse scale?”  
  
—\[The Inverse Scale of The Black Dragon of the World's Foundation\]  
I took out the palm-sized scale from my pocket. It reflected the light,
glittering black.  
Looking at its status, it has the following effects:  
  
\* All status ailments nullified  
\* Constant HP recovery  
\* Magic abnormality detection  
  
A pretty overpowered accessory item!  
  
“This, won’t get sick with this.”  
“S-such a powerful item exists?! Then, if Little Reni holds this, the
chicken's miasma won't affect you?!”  
“Mhm.”  
  
Hamu, knowing about the \[Poisonous Chicken\], gave me this scale. The
\[Status Ailment Immunity\] effect should be useful.  
She must have given it to me so I could deal with the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]. She said she doesn’t take sides, but I think Hamu is always
kind.  
  
“If that’s the case, Lady Reni might be able to approach the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]. Even if it's rotten, it's the scale of the \[Black Dragon of
the World's Foundation\]… If she touches the miasma a little and it's
okay, then she can just approach the \[Poisonous Chicken\].”  
“Mhm.”  
“Little Reni is amazing! …Ah, but then, Karigano won’t be able to help
Little Reni. I wanted to be with you in case something happened!”  
“That’s true. Lady Reni could probably defeat the \[Poisonous Chicken\]
on her own, but I'd like to be by her side and burn her heroic figure
into my memory.…!”  
  
That’s right. With this method, only I can approach the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]. But—  
  
“I have a good plan.”  
  
I nodded firmly to reassure them.  
I have an idea.  
If the \[Status Ailment Immunity\] effect negates the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]'s miasma, then there’s a way. Fufu.  
  
“Leave it to Reni!”  
  
So that’s it.  
We entered \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\] and, guided by Karigano, headed
towards the \[Poisonous Chicken\].  
But problems arose immediately…  
  
“Lady Reni! A sandstorm!”  
“Fuwaa…! The wind is strong.”  
“I-I forgot…! Sandstorms come up quickly in the desert!”  
“You forgot!? What was the point of you guiding us?!”  
“Sorry, sorry!”  
  
The reddish-brown sand was whipped around by the strong wind.  
The wind cutting through the desert is so fierce that it feels like I'm
going to be blown away.  
Samyu lifted me and held me tightly, desperately trying to protect me
from the wind. Karigano was jumping around anxiously, saying, "Hyah!"  
If we get caught in a sandstorm like this, it's going to be really
tough.  
  
“Item box.”  
  
I searched for what I wanted from the displayed menu. It was  
  
“—Tent!”  
  
—Tent (Exceptional)!  
As I spoke, a tent popped up in the desert.  
Several wooden poles were arranged in a conical shape, with a white
cloth draped over them. It’s a teepee-shaped tent.  
  
“Whaaa?!”  
“T-this is… Lady Reni?!”  
  
Their surprised voices echoed as the strong wind blew by.  
I tapped Samyu’s shoulder and urged her towards the tent.  
  
“The tent won’t be blown away.”  
“Y-yes!”  
“Karigano, inside too.”  
“Got it!”  
  
Hearing my words, the two hurried into the tent.  
The tent isn’t that spacious, but it has enough room for three people to
stretch out and sleep.  
For the time being, the three of us sat near the center.  
There was the sound of a strong wind, but the tent didn’t sway, and the
poles didn’t collapse.  
  
“As expected of Lady Reni’s item… It doesn’t budge even in this strong
wind…”  
“Why is that?! It's strange. Even if Karigano hastily made a tent of the
same shape with wood and cloth, it would fly away immediately!”  
  
I chuckled at what they had to say.  
There are different tiers of items. Indeed, the (Exceptional) grade ones
are different.  
  
“Is the sandstorm big?”  
“Ah, it is. Karigano was careless. Sandstorms happen quickly in \[The
Ever-Shifting Desert\]. But they calm down quickly."  
  
I see. It seems it won’t last long.  
  
“Indeed. The wind has already stopped.”  
  
Samyu, who had been listening to the sounds outside, muttered and stood
up. Then she peeked outside the tent.  
  
“It seems the sandstorm has dissipated. Lady Reni, this way.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
I took Samyu’s hand and went outside.  
The scenery had changed dramatically.  
  
“Waow… The sand dune over there is gone…”  
  
Before entering the tent, there were two sand dunes in the distance. But
they had completely disappeared. Instead…  
  
“Lady Reni, it seems that the sand dunes over there have grown into
three.”  
“Waow…”  
  
Looking to the right as Samyu indicated, I saw that there were now three
sand dunes where there weren't any!  
  
“This is… the reason the map changes…”  
  
My heart pounded with excitement at seeing what was really happening in
the game.  
Amazing! That’s how it is…!  
In the game, \[The Ever-Shifting Desert\]’s terrain changed every time
you entered and exited the map. I’d always wanted to know why that
happened in reality.  
I wanted to see it with my own eyes.  
To hear it with my own ears, touch it with my own hands, and feel the
air.  
And now, the world after the sandstorm had passed was shining brightly
in the sunlight…  
  
“Beautiful…”  
  
The map changes because of the strong winds blowing through the
desert.  
If the reddish-brown sand is blown away by the strong wind, a single
sand dune can easily be displaced.  
  
“Sandstorms are troublesome, but with the terrain changing so easily,
it's easy to get lost..."  
“That’s right. Karigano is a beast person, so even if the terrain
changes due to a sandstorm, I can tell the general direction by the
smell of the wind. But ordinary humans get lost easily. Many have gone
missing.”  
  
Karigano also came out of the tent and looked around.  
Indeed, there are no landmarks in this desert.  
There was only reddish-brown sand as far as the eye could see, and if
you used the location and shape of sand dunes as landmarks, and those
were blown away by a sandstorm, you could easily get lost.  
  
“Karigano, do you still know where the Cockatrice is?”  
“I do! The wind mixes during a sandstorm, making it difficult, but if we
get through it, I can follow the scent again!”  
“Mhm. Let’s go then.”  
  
So, we proceeded into the desert again.  
After we moved a little distance away, the tent disappeared
automatically. Karigano screamed “Wha?!” in surprise again, but…  
The \[Tent (Exceptional)\] is a consumable item, so it can't be
helped.  
Following Karigano’s guidance, we closed in on the \[Poisonous
Chicken\]. We encountered a few sandstorms along the way, and we
weathered them in tents.  
And then—  
  
“It’s here! Little Reni, be careful. The miasma is where the air is
murky!”  
“Mhm. I’ll touch it a little.”  
“Slowly, carefully.”  
“Mhm.”  
  
—In the reddish-brown desert, murky air, a mix of purple and green,
suddenly appeared.  
It seemed to cover a radius of about 100 meters, with the \[Poisonous
Chicken\] at its center.  
Following Samyu and Karigano’s words of caution, I lightly touched the
murky air with my cat's paw.  
  
“…I’m fine.”  
“As expected of Little Reni… Ordinary humans would feel sick and
collapse just from that!”  
“It’s quite a high concentration of miasma.”  
  
Listening to their voices, I gradually moved my body into the murky air.
And even with my whole body in the murky air, I was fine!  
  
"Don't worry."  
  
Because the air was murky, I could barely see Samyu and Karigano. But I
could hear their voices, so if I shouted, they would answer
immediately.  
  
“Lady Reni! Please be very careful!”  
“Little Reni! As soon as the miasma is gone, I'll be there right
away!"  
“Mhm. I’ll go.”  
  
I told them to run away if they felt like they were about to be hit by
the \[Poisonous Chicken\]'s miasma.  
So, first, let's get rid of the miasma.  
The method—exists. The rest is just preparation!  
  
“Pickaxe!”  
  
—I’ll dig a hole in the desert!
