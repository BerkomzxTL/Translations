# Chapter 59・It Seems They Don’t Get Along

The carriage rattled and swayed.  
With the rhythm of the noise, my consciousness slowly surfaced.  
Yesterday, I think I was in a dreamlike state while riding in the
carriage, and I had taken off my \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and \[Winged
Rabbit Boots\] as Samyu told me to.  
Right now, I'm probably only wearing my \[Hermit's Robe\] with the hood
up.  
  
"...Mm"  
  
I must have fallen asleep and Samyu carried me to the carriage.  
So, I'm probably in the carriage now.  
Sleeping in a carriage usually makes my body ache, but there's a soft
cushion under my back, so it doesn't hurt. Being a four-year-old, I
could easily lie down in the carriage, which was nice.  
And—  
  
"Warm."  
  
She must have put a nice pillow under my head; it’s soft and doesn't
hurt at all. In fact, it's fluffy and warm.  
So, I rubbed my head against it to confirm the feeling. In doing so, I
think my hood came off.  
  
"Higu—"  
  
Then, a strange voice came from above.  
I opened my eyes, and there was Samyu's face. She was sitting in the
carriage, peering down at me.  
  
"It was Samyu."  
  
The warm thing under my head was Samyu's lap.  
Seeing Samyu's face first thing when I woke up made me laugh
involuntarily.  
  
"Good morning."  
  
And then I reached out my hand.  
As I stroked her cheek, Samyu stopped breathing.  
  
"Ah"  
  
Oh no.  
I was still half asleep. This is definitely not good...!  
  
"Aaaaaah"  
  
My prediction came true, and Samyu started shaking violently.  
And—  
  
"Ah, impossible, precious, impossible, I can't handle it."  
  
...As I woke up, I saw the whites of Samyu's eyes.  
  
"I'm sorry..."  
  
Mumbling, I quickly separated myself from Samyu and sat properly in the
carriage.  
A few seconds later, Samyu returned to her usual beautiful girl face.  
  
"Lady Reni, good morning."  
"...Mmn."  
"Although it may have been presumptuous of me, while in the carriage, I…
I used my lap as a pillow!"  
  
While saying this, Samyu's breath became ragged again.  
Shock-induced respiratory distress...?  
  
"Samyu, did you rest?"  
"I'm fine! It was the most blissful experience!"  
  
Did she get some rest? The question was answered with bliss.  
If I was using her lap as a pillow all night, her posture must have been
incredibly uncomfortable, but Samyu looks more radiant than usual.  
Well...as long as Samyu is okay, that's all that matters.  
  
"Thanks to Lady Reni's items, the horse is traveling at an amazing speed
towards the capital. We considered catching up with Gaillard along the
way, but that didn't happen. It seems that his horse wasn't an ordinary
one either."  
"Hmm... I guess..."  
  
Even a horse with \[Swift Hooves\] couldn't catch up with Count
Gaillard's carriage.  
One possibility is that he's using what's called a \[Death Horse\],
something other than a living horse.  
Death Horses, like Living Mail, are monsters that appear in \[The
Wandering Capital, Riwander\].  
The horses caught in the immortality magic circle lost their physical
form but retained their bridles, saddles, and stirrups, becoming glowing
blue spirits.  
That monster could run all night, and it runs like it's flying, so it
might be faster than us.  
As I spoke, recalling information from the game, Samyu nodded, saying,
"I see."  
  
"Indeed, if it's a Death Horse, it's no wonder we couldn't catch up. If
he has Living Mail under his command, it's not surprising that he also
has a Death Horse."  
  
This means Count Gaillard might command all the monsters that appear on
\[The Wandering Capital, Riwander\] map.  
I don't know why this is possible, but maybe it has something to do with
\[The Wandering Capital, Riwander\].  
  
"Maybe Hellbirds and Ghouls too."  
  
There's a possibility he has \[Hellbirds\] and \[Ghouls\] as well.  
  
"That’s true… If he has Hellbirds, it explains the Living Mail appearing
from the sky during the tea party. He must have had it carried by
Hellbirds."  
"Mhm."  
  
It was a surprise to see it suddenly appear from the sky, but it's
possible if he commands flying monsters.  
So far, we've only been attacked by Living Mail, so we don't know for
sure.  
  
"Lady Reni has extensive knowledge of monsters."  
  
As Samyu murmured, there was a knock on the carriage.  
The sound came from the front of the carriage, where there's a small
window for communicating with the driver.  
  
"Lady Reni, your items."  
"Mhm."  
  
Prompted by Samyu, I put on the \[Cat's Paw Gloves\] and \[Winged Rabbit
Boots\].  
After Samyu confirmed I had equipped the items, she opened the window.  
  
"Excuse the interruption, but we're almost at the capital."  
"Pio."  
"Reni, good morning. Did you get some sleep?"  
"Mm. I slept soundly."  
  
It seems the driver is Pio.  
Her red hair swayed in the wind, her red eyes looked at me, and she
smiled softly.  
  
"We'll infiltrate the capital in a small group to rescue Her Highness.
Since we won't be able to relax once we're in the capital, we should
have breakfast here and prepare ourselves. Is that alright?"  
"Mhm."  
"Understood."  
  
I nodded at Pio's words, and the carriage gradually slowed and came to a
stop.  
I hopped out through the door Samyu opened for me.  
Only Samyu and I were in the carriage. Besides Pio, the driver, there
was no one else, so it seems the three of us will be infiltrating the
capital.  
  
"Only three of us?"  
"Yes. Even if we increased our numbers, I don't think we could stand
against the Living Mail. Besides, if Gaillard takes the entire capital
hostage, it will make it difficult for us to move."  
"That's right."  
"Then, we should avoid fighting as much as possible and focus solely on
rescuing Her Highness. In that case, we should limit our numbers so as
not to draw attention."  
"Lady Reni and I are enough. I don’t think we need a human knight."  
"I don't believe I can fight as well as you two. However, we need
someone to control the carriage and gather information. You're an elf,
so you stand out, and Reni is still young."  
"I know. We've discussed this already."  
"...You're complaining again."  
"I'm not complaining. I'm just reaffirming the facts. Lady Reni and I
are enough."  
  
I can feel the sparks flying between the two of them.  
Mmn…Samyu and Pio don't get along very well.  
Samyu doesn't like humans in the first place, and she seems to still not
have forgiven Pio for what she did to me.  
Pio sincerely apologized to me and is very polite, which I appreciate,
but it seems like she doesn't get along with Samyu.  
  
"Samyu, Pio."  
  
I took both of their hands at the same time.  
Both Samyu and Pio immediately looked at me and softened their
expressions.
