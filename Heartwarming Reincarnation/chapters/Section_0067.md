# Chapter 67・We’re Heading To The Elven Forest

Mana Manipulation Arc Begins  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
I successfully turned Gaillard into a star and destroyed the underground
facility of the new religious group, \[Tears of the Goddess\], which was
searching for the \[Jewel\].  
However, Gaillard used the magic circle from \[The Wandering City,
Riwander\], causing changes to my body.  
  
—The seal was broken.  
  
My mother, who suffered from mana rampages, wished to become human to
live with my father. And the Jewel granted that wish.  
I inherited it, possessing the \[Jewel\] since birth, and was in a
sealed state.  
With the seal broken, I now have an elf's appearance and gained \[Mana
Manipulation\], but my body can't keep up with the sudden surge of
mana.  
  
—Mana Rampage  
  
The same symptoms as my mother, who was an elf.  
I'm just feeling sleepier than usual and a little feverish, but seeing
Samyu's worried expression, I realized it's not good.  
And…  
  
"Reni, you absolutely mustn't overexert yourself."  
"That’s right. Reni, you're too careless about yourself. Please be more
careful and take care of your body."  
  
After blowing Gaillard away, I immediately fell asleep and woke up lying
in a luxurious bed.  
This seems to be a room in that white castle I saw when I looked at the
capital from outside.  
Carrie and Pio were there beside my bed, speaking to me softly.  
  
"I will remain in Gaillard's capital and ensure that no further chaos
occurs, and that the citizens can continue to live as they have been."  
"Mhm."  
"I will also continue to guard you here."  
"Mhm."  
  
This is what we decided before I fell asleep.  
Carrie will work with her family to prevent further chaos, and Pio will
support her.  
So, this is goodbye for now.  
I nodded in response, and Samyu, who was standing next to them, took
over the conversation.  
  
"Lady Reni, how is your condition?"  
"Mmn, I feel a little better after sleeping."  
  
I still feel hot, but the sleepiness has subsided considerably.  
Just that much makes my body feel better.  
  
"Lady Reni went to bed just before noon yesterday. It's already the next
morning now."  
"That… long?"  
  
I slept longer than I thought.  
Maybe it was because of the massive amount of mana used to purify the
entire capital, or the backlash from the seal being broken, but that
sleepiness and a full day of sleep are a little concerning.  
And if the mana rampage continues, I’ll… die, right?  
  
"Lady Reni's mana seems to be stabilizing a bit compared to before you
slept. I would like to move now, if you’re alright with that?"  
"Go to the Elven Forest?"  
"Yes. I've contacted Her Majesty. Her Majesty's sister is her guardian.
And she’s the current Queen of the Elves. We've been told to head to the
Elven Forest immediately."  
"Okay."  
  
My mother left the Elven Forest and chose to live with my father.  
She and my father ran away, and my father is wanted for kidnapping the
Elf Queen. So, my mother has not been using the \[Telepathy\] possible
through the elven secret, \[Guardian Contract\].  
However, it seems she contacted Samyu and the Elven Forest for my
sake.  
  
"Papa, Mama, are they okay?"  
  
Because my mother contacted them, won’t the elves focus their attention
there and try to stop my father and mother from living together?  
When I asked, Samyu furrowed her brows worriedly.  
  
"Your worries, Lady Reni, are understandable. We elves do not have good
feelings toward human men… Lady Reni's father."  
  
Then, she faced forward, her fists clenched.  
  
"To the elves, he is like a venomous snake or scorpion."  
"Samyu…"  
  
So direct…  
  
"However, I believe I fully understand the Queen's feelings… and my own
foolishness. So, right now, we only want to heal Lady Reni's body. That
is the wish of all elves."  
"I see."  
  
It seems things haven't escalated to disrupt my father and mother's
life. I breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
"By the way, how are we going to get to the Elven Forest? Considering
Reni's condition, a carriage might be best, wouldn't it?"  
"I think it's best to go by carriage, just like when we came to the
capital. In that case, I'll be the driver, and we can have Juliana and
the others put on the horseshoes."  
  
Carrie and Pio offered suggestions on how to travel.  
However, Samyu shook her head.  
  
"We can't use a carriage. Guiding humans to the Elven Forest is
forbidden. So I myself must be the driver, but in that case, returning
the carriage and horses would be double the effort."  
"I see…"  
"With all due respect—I will carry you."  
  
Samyu nodded with determined eyes.  
So…  
  
"Reni, this won’t be the last time. I want to see you again. I
definitely will… definitely!!"  
"Mhm. Definitely."  
"I want Reni to eat my cooking again."  
"Mhm, I like Pio's food."  
  
In front of the gate of Gaillard's capital.  
Carrie and Pio, along with the knight guards, had come all this way to
see me off.  
Carrie was clutching her skirt tightly, looking up at me desperately.
And Pio was looking at me worriedly.  
As for me, I'm being held by Samyu.  
Even though I’m not wearing a hood, she didn’t collapse and is remaining
in place.  
  
"Hang in there, me. Hang in there, me. ...Hang, in there. I can...I
can...Elf!"  
  
…Mmn. I hear her muttering from above.  
I know Samyu is enduring it, so I won’t look up. If our eyes meet, it'll
definitely be dangerous. Very dangerous.  
  
"Bye."  
  
I'm sure we'll meet again… I want to meet again.  
So, this isn't a sad farewell.  
While being carried, I reached out to Carrie and Pio.  
They grasped my hands tightly.  
  
"Well then, let's go."  
  
The warmth of their hands and the warmth of Samyu hugging me.  
Feeling my chest becoming warm and cozy, I gently let go of their
hands.  
  
"Reni! Take care of yourself!"  
"Reni, don't overwork yourself…!"  
  
They worry about me until the very end. Listening to their voices, Samyu
jumped forward powerfully.  
  
"Whoa…!"  
  
Amazing. The world is rushing past in an instant.  
  
"Lady Reni, are you alright?"  
"Mhm. It's fun."  
  
My body still feels hot though.  
But the refreshing wind on my cheeks and the scenery flashing by—they’re
all things that Samyu creates with each step she takes.  
\[Mana Manipulation\] is amazing.  
I'd always thought Samyu's abilities were incredible, but this is the
fastest I've ever seen her.  
  
"It’s fast."  
"Yes. This is my fastest!"  
"Don't push yourself."  
"No problem! I'll dash through to the Elven Forest like this!"  
"Mhm."  
"All the Elves are waiting for Lady Reni."  
"Mhm."  
"It's a very, very beautiful forest."  
"Mhm. I'm looking forward to it."  
  
Now then! Our destination is the Elven Forest!
