# Chapter 3・Leave It to Me

When my father’s eyes met mine, he tried to smile as much as possible,
lifting the corners of his mouth slightly before quickly closing his
eyes.  
Seeing my father like that, I momentarily put aside my excitement and
stared intently at his face.  
  
—My father's condition has been worsening since I was born.  
  
When I was born, he was healthy and worked diligently, worrying about my
mother and me, who couldn't move yet. He was a skilled hunter, often
boasting about hunting large monsters and obtaining fine meat, causing
my mother to laugh, and say things like, "Oh my."  
But, about a month after I was born, he apparently messed up a monster
hunt.  
My previously healthy father became bedridden, and my mother started
working more often in his stead.  
Although I was still a baby, my past life was that of a hikikomori high
school girl. My upbringing, which was probably easier than raising a
normal child, was somehow managed by my father.  
And now I'm one year older. I could see that my father's condition is
not improving; in fact, it's visibly worsening.  
My mother works from morning till night to buy medicine for my father
and to support our family. She wakes up early to help at the village
bakery. After returning, she makes breakfast for father and me, does
laundry, tends the field, prepares an early lunch, and then walks to a
distant town to work at an inn until late at night.  
Honestly, if she continues this lifestyle, I think my mother will be the
one to collapse next.  
So that's it.  
  
"Get evewything back in owdew."  
  
Get everything back in order, okay! I said get everything back in
order!  
Before I set off on my journey, I want to create an environment where my
father and mother can live together peacefully and happily.  
Then, I can leave for my journey with peace of mind.  
Now that that's decided, the question is how to prepare the environment,
but that's a piece of cake for me, the strongest one-year-old.  
  
\* Secretly give my father a \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\]  
\* Secretly spread \[Fertilizer (Legendary)\] on the field  
  
Perfect.  
Until now, I couldn't check my status and spent my days on walking
training, speech training, and vocalization practice. But now that I can
check my status and use my item box, there's nothing I can't do.  
The \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\] can cure any status ailment and
fully restores HP even if it drops to 1. The in-game icon of the
recovery potion was a bottle, and the usage motion was to bring it to
the mouth and drink it, so if I give this potion to my father, he'll get
better immediately.  
The only problem is that I don't want to show this power to people.  
I've been living with my parents up until now, but I’ve never seen
either of them say anything about a ‘status’. Of course, it may be that
they simply don’t use it at home, but I feel like I'm the only one who
can use the status and item box. It's just a hunch.  
So, secretly, very secretly, I'll cure my father.  
  
And my reason for spreading fertilizer on the field is for their future
livelihood.  
If my father wants to be a hunter again, I think that's fine, but I also
think mother needs to be able to support herself, just in case he gets
injured again.  
Even working at the bakery is short-term, and going to town to work is
inefficient because of the distance. So, I think it's best to use this
house and land (field) to its fullest.  
The \[Fertilizer (Legendary)\], when spread on soil, lets you harvest
S-rank materials. There’s also a good chance of getting SS-rank
materials. The production efficiency of C-rank materials such as
potatoes and carrots will also increase, making it good for
self-sufficiency.  
The in-game icon for fertilizer is a cloth bag with something soil-like
inside, and the use animation is sprinkling the soil-like substance from
the bag. So, if I spread fertilizer, the back field will definitely have
a bumper crop.  
So, secretly, very secretly, I'll sprinkle it.  
  
After thinking that far, I looked at my father's face again.  
His chest is rising and falling with weak breaths. Shallow, rapid
breaths. He must be very uncomfortable. Don't worry. Leave it to me!  
  
"Un, sho"  
  
I put all my strength into my legs and tried my best to climb onto the
bed.  
Grab the bedsheet firmly with your hands! Your whole body! Put all your
strength into it!  
And somehow, I managed to climb onto the bed, and let out a big sigh.  
  
"Aitem, bok-chu"  
  
Item box!  
From the items that appeared, I selected the \[Recovery Potion
(Legendary)\] with my gaze. The quantity is one. And—  
  
"That's it!"  
  
As I spoke, a bottle of \[Recovery Potion (Legendary)\] appeared between
my hands. I quickly grabbed it.  
  
"H-heavy…"  
  
It's heavy… Maybe a little too heavy for a one-year-old…. It also has a
cap that needs to be twisted open, but it might be a little too tight
for a one-year-old…  
But I won't give up. In preparation for this day, besides walking
training, speech training, and vocalization training, I also did grip
training…!  
I sat down on the bed and secured the bottle between my knees. Then,
holding the lid firmly with both hands, I turned it to the right.
Then—  
  
"Aitaa!"  
  
It opened! It opened!  
I unintentionally let out a, ‘Fuwaa!’ But at that moment—  
  
"Fuwa—ah!"  
  
The bottle, which I had secured between my knees, tilted forward.  
I quickly reached out, but I couldn't support the heavy bottle…  
  
Splash!  
  
A high school girl reincarnated into her favorite game world. Her name
in this world, Reni Shurm Guora. The first attempt of this level-capped
strongest one-year-old in another world ended with—  
  
—soaking her father's bed.
