# Chapter 47・To Reduce Anxiety a Little

*‘L-Lady Reni!? That light just now…!’*  
*‘My chest felt hot. I thought, 'Gather,' and then light came out.’*  
*‘Understood. Could you please return to the shade where I am
immediately?’*  
*‘Mhm.’*  
  
Samyu's anxious voice resounded through \[Telepathy\].  
It seems like it would be best to leave my current location, so I
immediately flew and landed beside Samyu.  
  
*‘Lady Reni, once we're in the shade, please immediately reveal
yourself—’*  
"Mhm. I'm already here."  
"Yes! Then, this way."  
  
I lowered my hood and revealed myself.  
I did it properly in the shade, so I probably wasn't seen by anyone.  
Then, the red-haired knight ran to where I was originally standing—  
  
"The Light should have come from here…"  
  
The red-haired knight seemed to be searching for the source of the
light.  
I’m not there anymore, so there's just a tree.  
  
"Lady Pio! This armor appears to have ceased functioning."  
"I see…"  
  
While the red-haired knight investigated the source of the light, the
three soldiers seemed to have examined the full-body armor.  
Unlike before, the Living Mail wasn’t moving at all. Only the
lead-colored armor lay piled up.  
After hearing the soldier's report, the red-haired knight turned her
gaze to Samyu.  
  
"It looked to me like it was purified… Was it you?"  
"I was here."  
"...That's right. You told me earlier how to eliminate the monster,
saying you didn't possess that power yourself."  
"The place where the light emanated is far from me. Lady Reni was here,
so I could not leave."  
  
After saying that, Samyu gave me a knowing look.  
Mhm. Got it.  
  
"Reni is here."  
  
Saying this, I stepped out from the shade.  
Samyu was probably trying to conceal the fact that I emitted the light.
So, I went along with it… I think I managed to.  
  
"Perhaps you should investigate the armor further? You should also be
wary of your surroundings. Where did it come from? Why did it appear
from the sky? Are there any others? Shouldn't you be considering those
things?"  
  
Samyu calmly and smoothly stated.  
The red-haired knight looked back and forth between me and Samyu, then
nodded, "Understood."  
  
"Let's investigate."  
  
With that, the red-haired knight turned on her heels and headed toward
the full-body armor.  
As expected of Samyu. She skillfully diverted the conversation away from
the light.  
  
"Reni!! Reni!! Are you alright!?"  
  
The fact that the danger had passed must have been conveyed to Carrie as
well.  
Carrie, who had been sheltering in front of the mansion, ran over.  
Running in a dress must be difficult, but Carrie, out of breath, ran
straight toward me.  
  
"A-are you injured anywhere?"  
"I'm okay."  
  
Carrie ran up to me and clasped her hands in front of her chest,
anxiously watching me. So, to reassure her, I gently enveloped her
hands.  
  
"Reni is strong."  
"Oh...!! That's right...!!"  
"Were you scared, Carrie?"  
"I'm alright!!"  
  
Carrie said that, her face flushing red.  
Yes. It's okay now. But—  
  
"It must be tiring."  
  
Since birth, she’s been targeted by something. When she tried to run
away, she was attacked by a dragon, and then again by Living Mail.  
What if she’s attacked again in the future?  
I think the red-haired knight is very strong, and those around her are
trying to protect Carrie. So, to be able to help them…  
  
"Here, take this."  
  
Saying so, I reached for the \[Detection Bell\] attached to my waist.  
Since it's a cat's paw, untying the knot seemed difficult, so I cut the
strap with my claws.  
  
"If an enemy comes, it will ring."  
"Ring…? What does that mean?"  
  
Carrie looked puzzled.  
I took her right hand and placed the \[Detection Bell\] on her palm.  
  
"If an enemy comes, the bell will ring. Here."  
"Eh… B-but, this is Reni's, isn't it?"  
"Mhm. Reni's."  
  
Carrie seemed confused still, but decided to look at what had been
placed in her hand.  
She gently raised her right hand to eye level—  
  
"It's very pretty…"  
"The gold bell is cute, right?"  
  
I also think its round shape is cute.  
So, I laughed softly, and Carrie stared at me blankly.  
Then, as if she suddenly realized something, she shook her head.  
  
"I mustn't! This is something Reni was wearing. I can't possibly
receive—"  
"If an enemy comes, it will ring on its own. Very convenient."  
"So if an enemy approaches it will detect it and make a sound?"  
"Mhm. Only the person wearing it can hear it."  
"Su-such an amazing item, I really can't receive it!"  
  
Carrie, with a surprised look, hurriedly tried to return the \[Detection
Bell\] to me.  
Hmm. It seems like I haven't gotten the point across.  
  
"Carrie, less anxious."  
"My… anxiety?"  
"Mhm. If it rings, it's dangerous. But if it doesn't ring, it's okay."  
  
My words made Carrie look bewildered.  
That’s right. The \[Detection Bell\] is an item that rings when an enemy
is present, but conversely, if it doesn't ring, it means it's safe.  
  
"If it rings, immediately tell everyone. If not, you can relax."  
  
Carrie is a hard worker.  
  
"So you can have time to rest."  
  
To reduce her anxiety even a little.  
  
"I want you to have it."  
"Reni… But, won't Reni be in trouble?"  
"Reni is strong."  
  
I have plenty of other equipment!  
So, I nodded reassuringly, and Carrie clasped her right hand tightly,
gently cradling it with her left hand.  
  
"I will… treasure it… I will treasure it very much."
