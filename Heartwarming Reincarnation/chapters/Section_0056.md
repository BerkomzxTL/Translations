# Chapter 56・Reni Is a Genius 2

Having parted with Reni and leaving Reoliga City, Carrie was inside a
carriage.  
Three maids were traveling with her, her constant companions.  
  
"My Lady, it's finished!"  
  
After settling into the carriage.  
A maid presented a jewel box to Carrie.  
Carrie received it and gently opened the lid.  
She then put on what was inside—  
  
"H-how do I look?"  
"It suits you perfectly!"  
"It's lovely, Your Highness!"  
"This is proof of the friendship between Your Highness and Lady
Reni…!"  
  
―The contents of the jewel box was the \[Detection Bell\], fashioned
into a bracelet.  
Reni had given it to Carrie because she was in danger.  
Reni wore it on her hip with a strap, but Carrie, being a princess,
couldn't do the same.  
So, it was remade into something she could always wear.  
Thomas, the mayor of Reoliga, had recommended a jeweler, and they made
it quickly.  
As a princess, Carrie usually associated with far more expensive
stores.  
But to her, this bracelet is the most beautiful accessory.  
She couldn't help but smile.  
  
"Ahh… Her Highness looks so happy…"  
"That's wonderful, that's wonderful…"  
"You'll definitely see her again!"  
  
The three maids, seeing their delighted mistress, spoke with joy.  
Although she had separated from Reni, they made a promise to meet
again.  
Once things settled down in the capital, she was sure she’d be able to
see Reni again.  
  
"Reni… is amazing. A genius. …And, well, she makes me happy so
quickly."  
  
Carrie blushed bashfully.  
The three maids nodded in agreement, saying, "Yes."  
  
"Your Highness, what would you like to do with these?"  
  
The maids indicated the items Reni had given her at departure.  
Carrie, being a princess, needed to pay attention to her appearance. She
couldn't just carry the bag as it was.  
  
"We'll carry the recovery medicine and the talisman. What will you do
with these?"  
"I want to keep these."  
  
Carrie indicated the \[Flash Stone\] and the \[Fireworks Stone\].
Together, they were about the size of her palm, so they wouldn’t stand
out even if she put them in her pocket.  
It's truly unfitting for a lady to stuff things into her pockets.  
However, Carrie chose to carry them herself.  
  
"…And this doll, I want to keep it for as long as possible. Although it
might be difficult during official events."  
  
She hugged the \[Substitute Doll\] she was holding to her chest.  
Its design was a little unusual for a young child to possess. Carrying
it around might invite more gossip from nosy nobles.  
But Carrie had no intention of parting with the doll.  
  
"I don't mind what they say. It's something Reni… gave me."  
  
Those who mocked her and those who worried about her and smiled at
her.  
Carrie overwhelmingly cherished the latter.  
  
"Yes! If anyone says anything, we won't forgive them!"  
"That's right!"  
"We'll keep the recovery medicine and the talisman readily available, so
please let us know if you need them."  
  
The three maids supported Carrie's choice.  
And so, the carriage continued, with several breaks along the way.  
Count Gaillard, who had left earlier, was far ahead and they didn't see
him even during the breaks.  
The carriage proceeded towards the next town, and before they knew it,
dusk fell and night arrived.  
Their next stop wasn't a break, but their lodging.  
Carrie's party, with increased guards, had no worries, and the day's
journey was nearing its end. Just as Carrie breathed a sigh of relief,
it happened.  
  
—Ting-ting.  
  
The sound of a bell.  
  
"Huh…!! Everyone, is everyone alright!?"  
"Your Highness, what's wrong?"  
"There's nothing that’s happened though..."  
"The bell… the bell is ringing!"  
  
It was the first time she had heard the bell.  
No one but Carrie, who was wearing the \[Detection Bell\], could hear
it.  
However, seeing Carrie’s condition, and having heard what Reni had said,
the three maids quickly took action.  
  
"I'll inform Lady Pio immediately!"  
  
They instructed the driver to stop the carriage and informed Pio, who
was riding alongside them, to increase vigilance.  
Shortly after, the carriage stopped, and guards surrounded them.  
Then, there was a knock on the carriage window.  
A maid opened the curtain, revealing Pio.  
The small window for communication was opened.  
  
"Your Highness, thank you for the warning. …Please stay inside the
carriage."  
"Pio, what's going on?"  
"...Thanks to Your Highness, we were able to prevent a surprise attack.
We also bought ourselves some time to prepare. But… there are too
many."  
"Too many…?"  
"Monsters like the one that appeared at the tea party."  
"The one in armor…?"  
"Your Highness, please don't leave the carriage."  
  
With that, Pio bowed and left.  
And beyond the open curtain, visible through the carriage window—  
  
"This…"  
  
—Numerous \[Living Mail\] lurking in the darkness of night.  
  
There must be over twenty of them.  
  
"Your Highness, this way."  
  
The maid quickly pulled the curtain, blocking the sight.  
They then rearranged the seats to ensure Carrie was in the safest
position.  
For a while, the sounds of fierce sword fighting and shouts from many
guards were audible.  
But then those sounds faded.  
The only remaining noise was the screeching sound of metal on metal—  
  
"W-what?!"  
"This is…?!"  
"Your Highness!!"  
  
Suddenly, a floating sensation overcame Carrie and her three maids.  
The carriage had been lifted.  
And then, it was slammed to the ground.  
  
  
"Ahh!"  
"Kyaah...!"  
"Ah!"  
  
The three maids immediately went to protect Carrie and embraced her.  
  
"Everyone…?"  
  
A broken carriage.  
The sight that met Carrie's still-conscious eyes was—  
  
"No way…"  
  
The maids were all unconscious.  
Outside the carriage, the guards lay on the ground.  
Only the \[Living Mail\] were standing.  
Despair reflected in Carrie's eyes.  
  
"…Why aren't they coming?"  
  
Amidst that despair, something strange happened.  
The \[Living Mail\] were not entering the carriage.  
They approached, but inexplicably stopped before reaching it, turning
around and returning to their original positions.  
Many \[Living Mail\] were behaving in the same way.  
  
"Could it be…"  
  
Her gaze shifted to the unconscious maids.  
The \[Evasion Talisman (Special)\] that one of the maids was supposed to
be holding had fallen from her limp hand, landing hidden under a piece
of broken wood from the carriage.  
It seemed that this fulfilled the necessary condition of "burying" the
talisman for it to be activated.  
  
"…Reni"  
  
—Protecting her.  
  
Even from a distance, Reni was undoubtedly protecting Carrie.  
Supporting her faltering spirit in the face of despair.  
  
"Your Highness, where are you?"  
  
A familiar voice rang out.  
  
"It's not like Her Highness the Princess to not reveal herself to those
who have come to pick her up."  
"…Gaillard"  
  
A single human figure stood amidst the numerous \[Living Mail\].  
Galim Gaillard, the lord of the Gaillard Domain and bestowed the title
of Count.  
  
"If you won't come out, then I'll have to resort to this… Can you see
this?"  
  
Gaillard believed that Carrie was merely hiding nearby.  
His plan—  
  
"Your Highness. Don't you care about what happens to your precious
knight?"  
"Pio…"  
  
—A hostage.  
  
One of the \[Living Mail\] surrounding Gaillard was holding Pio's wrist,
lifting her carelessly.  
Her beautiful red hair was soiled, and her clothes were tattered.  
She seemed unconscious, but far more seriously injured than anyone
else.  
  
"This knight rendered three divine messengers incapacitated. It’s only
natural that she will be punished."  
  
Gaillard’s gaze fell on three \[Living Mail\] sewn to the ground.  
Pio had fought valiantly… but was hopelessly outnumbered.  
  
"What will you do, Your Highness?"  
  
Gaillard's words were followed by a \[Living Mail\] raising its sword
towards Pio.  
  
"Pio…"  
  
Pio is Carrie's knight. Pio wouldn't want Carrie to rush out.  
Reni was protecting her with the \[Evasion Talisman (Special)\].  
The best course of action was to remain where she was, ignoring
Gaillard.  
  
"…I'm here."  
  
Carrie hesitated…  
But she couldn't abandon Pio.  
She emerged from the broken carriage, carrying only the recovery
medicine.  
Once she stepped out, the talisman became ineffective.  
Immediately, Gaillard's gaze fixed upon her.  
Having finally found Carrie, he smiled gently.  
  
"Your Highness, so you were there."  
"Gaillard… Why are you doing this…"  
  
Carrie had trusted Gaillard.  
Ever since she was little, he had helped her countless times.  
A plain princess, a powerless princess with no powers but rumors.  
While others spoke thus, Gaillard had always supported Carrie with a
calm demeanor.  
This time, when she consulted him about not wanting to cause trouble
during the Crown Prince's enthronement ceremony, he immediately invited
her to his domain.  
  
"Why? Well, the answer is clear."  
  
With a calm expression, Gaillard declared.  
  
"Because you are the child of God."  
  
There was no other reason.  
  
"I have long suspected that you are the child of God. But I lacked
proof. Attacking you, a princess, would be too risky. So, after getting
close to you, I was waiting for an opportunity. I had planned to let you
relax after arriving at the capital… but…"  
  
His grey eyes gleamed sharply.  
  
"I finally obtained proof."  
  
And then, dreamily, he announced.  
  
"That light we saw at the mayor's mansion. The power that purified the
monster. That must be the power of God. Her Highness, the Princess’
knight was about to be attacked, and your power finally awakened."  
"That was…"  
  
It wasn't her.  
Carrie was about to say that… but she closed her mouth.  
What would happen if she denied it here?  
Judging by Gaillard's demeanor, he wouldn't believe her even if she said
it. It was pointless to say anything.  
Moreover—  
  
"I had hoped to see your power today as well, so I brought a large
number of divine messengers. But I am disappointed that I wasn’t able
to."  
  
—What if it became known that the owner of the power was Reni, not
Carrie?  
  
There is no doubt that a light that actually purified the monster
appeared.  
Since Gaillard had witnessed it, it can't be said that nothing
happened.  
It seems he doesn’t suspect Reni at the moment, but depending on
Carrie's response, it wouldn't be surprising if suspicion fell on her
eventually.  
  
"…I'll go with you."  
"Yes. A wise decision. As expected of Her Highness the Princess."  
  
As Carrie answered Gaillard, she quietly opened the lid of the recovery
potion she was holding to her chest.  
It’s the recovery potion Reni had given her. Reni had said, "You'll feel
better if you drink it."  
However, that would attract Gaillard's attention.  
Gaillard would never allow Pio to recover.  
So, Carrie used another method Reni had employed.  
  
"…I'll say goodbye."  
"Yes, of course. This knight was very loyal. She must want to hear your
words."  
  
A calm tone.  
It's hard to believe they were the words of the man who put Pio in this
state.  
Carrie bit her lip and moved the recovery potion towards Pio. She
clasped Pio's injured hands in front of her chest and placed the
recovery medicine between them.  
By adjusting the angle, the open lid allowed the medicine to slowly
spill and soak into Pio's clothes.  
  
"Have you finished saying goodbye?"  
"Yes."  
  
Carrie quickly rose to her feet.  
Reni had liberally applied the recovery medicine to injured soldiers,
but doing the same here would attract Gaillard's scrutiny.  
This was the best she could do now.  
Although she wasn't certain if it would heal Pio, Carrie decided it was
better than doing nothing.  
  
—Ting-ting  
  
The bell rang.  
The precious bell Reni had given her, worn on her left wrist. The sound
that warned her of impending danger.  
  
"Then, please, Your Highness."  
  
Gaillard indicated the carriage he was riding in.  
Carrie clenched her right hand and looked ahead.  
  
"Yes."  
  
As resolutely as possible. She couldn't allow herself to be intimidated
by this man.  
If she looked back now, she might be able to check on Pio’s condition.  
But if he were to notice, Pio might get hurt again.  
  
"I think your ability to think things through is a great virtue."  
  
Gaillard's words stirred Carrie's heart.  
However, without minding it, she boarded the carriage.  
  
—Ting-ting  
  
The bell continued to ring.
