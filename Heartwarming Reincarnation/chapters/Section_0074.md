# Chapter 74・Elven Forests Are Prone to Burning

An elf man rushed into the room in a panic.  
Upon hearing those words, Hasano stood up and immediately looked at the
man.  
  
"The scale?"  
"It's...the entire perimeter of the Elven Forest! It's burning in a ring
around the Elven Forest, spreading towards the center here!"  
"You're putting out the fire, right?"  
"Yes! But the area is so vast…and the flames seem to have mana, so
ordinary water won't extinguish them, only magic can!"  
"What about the barrier?"  
"Normally it should block mana…but…"  
  
The man's voice was filled with anxiety and pained breathing.  
It was immediately clear that it was an emergency.  
  
"Anyway, let's get out of here. We need to assess the situation."  
"Yes!"  
  
The man jogged down the hallway, guiding Hasano.  
I followed behind.  
  
"Let's go too."  
"Yes!"  
  
The elf man, Hasano, myself, and Samyu went outside.  
Outside, the elves were moving frantically.  
Seeing us come out, several elves ran towards us and showed Hasano
pained expressions.  
  
"It's no use! We can't put out the fire in time!"  
"Those who can use water magic are trying to extinguish it, but the area
is too vast…"  
"The barrier…it won't hold…!!"  
  
The instant those words were spoken, the sky wobbled violently.  
The ancient magic that covered the Elven Forest, preventing outsiders
from entering, had disappeared.  
Then, a figure previously unseen appeared—  
  
"It's her after all."  
  
—Long black hair, a large tail, and wings on her back, which she was
flapping.  
The dragon girl that Samyu had continuously blew away.  
Just as I saw her, she spotted me.  
Her purple eyes narrowed, and she pointed at me and Samyu.  
  
"Found you! You finally showed yourselves! You'll regret not listening
to me!!"  
  
The dragon girl laughed, "Fuhahahaha!"  
Samyu silently nocked an arrow and released it without hesitation.  
The mana-imbued arrow flew straight towards her.  
The laughing girl seemed off guard and didn't notice the arrow.  
However, she seemed to see it at the last moment and hastily knocked the
arrow away with her tail.  
  
"Whoa! That's dangerous! What if it had hit?!"  
"I intended to hit you, so it's only natural."  
"What kind of dangerous elf is this?!"  
"That's irrelevant. More importantly, is the fire surrounding the forest
your doing?"  
"That’s right! Since you wouldn't come out, I had no choice!"  
  
The dragon girl said that, then laughed with a wicked look, "Kukuku."  
  
"It's the flames of the legendary \[Black Bahamut Dragon\]! They won't
go out until the earth has been burned to ashes. You'd best regret the
impoliteness that made me use this power as you burn!"  
  
Fuhahahahahaha!  
Hearing what the girl floating in the air said, I could see the
surrounding elves gasp.  
  
"At this rate…we…"  
"Will we all burn to ashes…?"  
"No…"  
"Damn it…"  
  
All I could hear were cries of despair.  
  
"It's alright, everyone…This place is worth protecting, and there's so
much here. It's sad to see it burn, but we won't all perish with it."  
  
Hasano nodded, encouraging everyone.  
  
"We need to break through to one point. Let's summon everyone. Those who
can use water magic will extinguish enough fire to create a path for us
to escape."  
"Y-yes!"  
  
At Hasano's words, the elf man dashed off.  
Then, as if chasing him, the dragon girl moved through the air.  
  
"Hmph! You think I'll let you get away?"  
  
She made a swift descent, reaching for the man. But—  
  
"I won't let you lay a hand on him."  
  
Samyu fired an arrow.  
The arrow flew straight, burning the girl's bangs as it passed right in
front of her.  
  
"Hey! I told you! That's dangerous! If I hadn't stopped, you would have
hit me?!"  
"I was aiming for you."  
  
Samyu, calmly replying, nocked another arrow.  
The dragon girl hurriedly flew high into the sky.  
  
"I'll stop her."  
"Go quickly."  
"Yes!"  
  
At the words of Samyu and Hasano, the elf man, who had been frozen in
place, began to run.  
This time, the dragon girl didn't chase him.  
  
"……Lady Reni, Lady Reni"  
  
While still nocking an arrow, Samyu whispered to me.  
But I didn't respond, instead staring blankly at the dragon girl.  
  
"\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]…"  
  
That was the name the dragon girl had given herself.  
The \[Black Dragon of the World's Foundation (Black Bahamut Dragon)\]. I
recognize the name from my gaming knowledge.  
The very foundation of this world. The legendary dragon that supports
it.  
In the game, it only appeared briefly in the opening cinematic. A dragon
that had fallen asleep to become the foundation of the world. The
goddess used it to create the land, and this world was born. I remember
the excitement I felt watching the movie where its myth was told.  
The \[Earth Dragon\] that guarded the \[Jewel\] was nothing compared to
this.  
That dragon…is here…alive, moving…talking…!!  
  
"Lady Reni…your sparkling eyes are very beautiful, but this isn't the
time…"  
  
Samyu's worried voice.  
She's right, this isn't the time. The Elven Forest is burning. We're
surrounded by the flames, and we might burn to ashes here.  
But—  
  
"She's cool."  
  
—I blurted it out.
