# Chapter 82・Let’s Go to the Lake

After that, I faced the magic silk thread every day. Samyu kept
running.  
A week later—  
  
"Samyu, Hasano, watch!"  
"Yes!"  
"Yeah"  
  
In the usual large hall, I picked up a single strand of magic silk
thread.  
The thread I had exploded countless times.  
As Hasano had surmised, my mana was so immense that even what I
considered a small amount was overflowing profusely.  
In this era of energy conservation, my fuel efficiency was terrible.
That's me. Furthermore, the overflowing mana was putting a strain on my
\[Mana Pathways\], making it unstable.  
And now—  
  
"Eiiya!"  
  
—A click and a wink.  
  
At that moment, the magic silk thread shimmered in seven colors. When I
let go, the magic silk thread, which should fall due to gravity, floated
in the air.  
Then, wriggling, it slowly formed a knot…  
  
"I did it…!"  
  
Waah! I did it! I couldn't manage to make a bow, but I somehow managed a
single knot…!  
With a sense of accomplishment in my heart, I wiped my forehead. Then, I
looked up at Samyu and Hasano's faces.  
I did it! I did it!  
But there—  
  
"Higu…uguhhih…"  
"Samyu…?"  
  
Her eyes are rolling back, her cheeks flushed…and she’s trembling. A
beautiful girl shouldn't make this kind of expression. Eh? This is
Samyu, right…?  
As I was surprised, Hasano snapped her eyes open and looked up at the
ceiling. Then, clenching her right hand, she howled towards the sky.  
  
"So cute!!"  
"Hasano…?"  
  
Looking closely, the elves waiting by the door were hugging each other
and cooing. What is going on…?  
My feelings of success over the \[Mana Manipulation\] turned into
suspicion over this strange sight. Then, Hasano, who had regained her
composure, gently lifted me.  
  
"Everyone was overwhelmed by how cute Reni was."  
"Really?"  
"Yes. Don't worry about it. Reni, you were a huge success!"  
"Mhm!"  
  
I was worried that a single knot wouldn't be enough, but it turned out
that that was not the case. Hasano praised me with a beaming smile, and
I was so happy that I couldn't help but giggle.  
  
"Reni's \[Mana Manipulation\] works well when you close one eye."  
"Mhm. One eye is just right."  
  
That's right. It's probably just a habit of mine, but it's difficult to
feel the mana with my eyes open. When I want to feel the mana
circulating through my body, I tend to close my eyes and shift my
consciousness inward.  
However, if I close both eyes and use \[Mana Manipulation\], I use too
much mana.  
So, I came up with the idea of closing one eye! It took a week, but I
think I finally managed to 'release just the right amount'.  
Energy-saving standard achieved.  
  
"The problem is that it's too cute…"  
  
Hasano said that, then stared at Samyu, who was still trembling with an
expression unbefitting a beautiful girl.  
  
"Samyu might not be able to handle it."  
  
…Samyu.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
"Well then, Lady Reni, let's go!"  
"Mhm!"  
"From here on, I will guide you, so rest assured!"  
"Mhm."  
  
Having finished our training, we finally decided to leave the Elven
Forest. Our destination is \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\]! There, we’ll
find the \[Water Serpent (Naga)\], which guards the treasure!  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\], who had been going on walks every day,
will also be joining our journey from today onwards.  
And we'll be saying goodbye to Hasano and everyone else.  
  
"Reni, thank you so much for coming to the Elven Forest. I had so much
fun spending time with you."  
"Mhm. I'll come again."  
  
Hasano's eyes welled up as she hugged me tightly.  
  
"Yes. That's right…This isn't goodbye, is it?"  
"Mhm. We'll meet again."  
"Yes."  
"Mama and Papa are coming too."  
"……Yes, that's right. Yes… that's right."  
"Mhm."  
  
Hasano sniffed twice before gently putting me down on the ground.  
  
"Reni's \[Mana Pathways\] are fine now. You haven't had a \[Mana
Rampage\] either. And since you've mastered \[Mana Manipulation\],
there's nothing to be afraid of."  
"Mhm. Reni is strong."  
  
Because Hasano helped me. Because she taught me so much.  
Looking straight up at Hasano, I nodded firmly.  
  
“……Have a good trip, Reni!”  
"I’m going."  
"Samyu, be careful too!"  
"Yes, thank you very much."  
  
I waved goodbye to Hasano and everyone.  
The elves, just like when I first came to the forest, were waving
branches of the \[Shining Tree\] to see us off.  
With my equipment all set, let's go!  
  
"Let's go! Straight east first!"  
"Mhm."  
"Yes!"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] spread her wings and flew off. Samyu and I
followed after her, kicking off the ground.  
  
"Oh, that reminds me."  
"Hmm? What is it?"  
"You don't have a name?"  
"A name? Do you mean my name?"  
"Mhm."  
  
As \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] flew swiftly, Samyu and I followed,
bouncing along. Since we seemed to be able to have a conversation, I
spoke, and received a puzzled voice in response.  
  
"I am \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]. Since I am the only one in the
world, I don't need any other name, do I?"  
  
I tilted my head at the voice that spoke as if it’s the most obvious
thing to say.  
But isn't that different from how I'm called "human" or "elf"?
Certainly, identification is possible, so the concept of a 'name' may
not be necessary…  
  
"Hard to say."  
"Huh?"  
"Black Bahamut Dragon, it's long and hard to say."  
"Is… is that so…?"  
"But it's cool."  
"Isn't it!? Isn't that right!?"  
"It's hard to say."  
"Guh…"  
  
As I said that, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] slowed her speed
considerably.  
  
"Please compose yourself! Lady Reni will be troubled if you don't guide
us."  
"Shut up! I'm just a little down right now!"  
"Down?"  
"……A little! It's nothing, really!"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] said that, then flapped her wings as if to
cheer herself up.  
I hummed and pondered. If she’s depressed because it's hard to
pronounce…  
  
"Reni can give you a name?"  
  
I thought it would be easier for both of us if she had a nickname.  
Then, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] stopped moving forward completely.  
  
"Waa!"  
"Lady Reni!"  
  
We nearly collided, so I quickly slowed down. But I ended up in a weird
position, and Samyu quickly came and held me to prevent me from
falling.  
  
"That's dangerous! I don't care about you, but what would you do if Lady
Reni got hurt?!"  
  
Samyu looked up at \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] with a "Huh?".  
I called out to Samyu to calm her down.  
  
"I'm okay. Samyu's here."  
"Ugu…"  
"Samyu, you're amazing. You just did a spin."  
  
That's right. Just now, Samyu held me as I lost my balance, and spun
around in the air.  
There were no walls in the air to change direction, but it was
amazing…!  
  
"I learned this from Lady Reni's two-step jump that I saw before, and I
was practicing it in the Elven Forest."  
"A new move…!"  
  
As expected of Samyu. While I was training in \[Mana Manipulation\], she
had acquired a new technique…!  
When I let out a sigh of admiration, Samyu laughed shyly.  
…However.  
  
"She’s not moving."  
"……That's right."  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] was still frozen in mid-air, not moving a
muscle.  
...I wonder if she’s okay.  
As I stared, she finally moved her neck with a creaking sound…  
  
"Little elf. You want to give me a name?"  
"Mhm. So it's easier to call you."  
  
Hmm. Judging from this reaction, it might not be good to think of a
name.  
  
"If you don't want to, I won't."  
  
So I added that, but \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\] flew in front of me in
a flash, puffing out her chest.  
  
"I permit it! Umu umu umu! I will grant your wish to give me a name!!
Tell me your ideas!"  
"Lady Reni, let's not do that. It would be a waste for Lady Reni to
think of a name. Wouldn't it be fine to call her 'Dragon'?"  
"No, no, no, that's absurd. My noble status won't be conveyed that way!
So, tell me, little elf. What name do you think suits me?"  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]'s purple eyes shone with excitement.  
…What should I do? I don't have any great ideas.  
'Black' is a bit too simple, and 'Dragon' is apparently no good.
Bahamut…Bahamut…  
I desperately racked my brain. And then—  
  
"Hamu?"  
  
Hamu, \[The Black Bahamut Dragon\]. How about that? It's cute and sounds
good…  
I tilted my head and looked into her purple eyes. They narrowed ever so
slightly.  
  
"Hamu. Hamu, is it! Umu umu umu, it's taken from Bahamut! It's a bit
simple, but that's fine! I permit it! Umu umu umu! Well, a little elf's
vocabulary is probably limited to that!!"  
  
With a loud "Fuhahahaha!", she let out a chuckle, then a loud
"Fuhahahaha!" again.  
  
"All right, then, let's go! We're still a long way from the lake!"  
"……I'll call you Dragon."  
"What are you doing!? Call me Hamu!"  
"I'll call you Dragon."  
  
\[The Black Bahamut Dragon\], Hamu, started flying again, and I
followed, bouncing along on the ground.  
I think Hamu likes the name… …but Samyu looks very displeased.  
So, while listening to Samyu and Hamu arguing, we headed for \[The Lake
of Refreshing Rain\].  
It took about three days, staying overnight in towns along the way. It
was located northeast of the Elven Forest.  
  
"We've arrived!"  
  
Hamu said that and stopped flapping her wings.  
I should have stopped there too, but I got so excited by Hamu's words
that I just passed her.  
After all, beyond this is the lake I've always dreamed of in the
game...!  
The lake was in the forest, and I made my way around the trees as I
approached the lake's surface.  
The beautiful water effect I saw in the game. What color is it in
reality? What kind of light shines on it?  
I couldn't contain my excitement.  
As I ran, an open space without trees immediately appeared.  
This is \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\]. The scene I've been wanting to
see ever since I was reborn. Now, it's right before my eyes—  
  
"Eh…"  
  
I inhaled to shout with joy. But what came out was a stunned voice.  
  
"What is it, Lady Reni?"  
  
Samyu caught up to me.  
However, unable to answer, I just stared blankly at the lake.  
  
"Water…"  
  
By then, Hamu must have caught up too.  
I heard the sound of wings flapping, and then—  
  
"What is this?!"  
  
—A scream came out.  
  
"The water’s dried up!!"  
  
Yes. There's no water, just a big depression.  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
TN: Full disclosure, I thought about it a bit, but I didn’t think the
original nickname Mut, or Muut (ムート, Mūto) for Bahamut (バハムート)
translated very well to english, so I took a different slice of Bahamut;
Hamu (ハムー)
