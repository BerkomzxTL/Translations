# Chapter 19・I’ll Talk With the Leader

After seeing off the meteor shower, I walked towards the leader who was
still unconscious.  
I really wish he’d wake up soon…  
  
“Wake up.”  
“…Ugh…”  
  
I patted his cheek with my paw, and finally he woke up.  
I was gentle, so his face isn’t messed up or anything. It’s perfectly
normal.  
  
“What…what happened…?”  
  
The leader looked around while still sitting, with a blank look on his
face.  
Well, it’s understandable. The hideout is now open-air, and all his
companions are gone.  
  
"There's something I want to ask you."  
  
I put some distance between me and the leader on the floor before taking
off my hood.  
He flinched, then met my gaze.  
  
“Y-you…where did you come from…?!”  
“Where’s the safe?”  
  
Ignoring the leader’s confusion, I asked my question.  
One of the debt collectors caught in the meteor shower just now muttered
something about a “safe.” Surely, proof of his connection to the mayor,
Shultem, is inside.  
However, when I was excavating the rubble, I couldn’t find anything
resembling a safe.  
Even if my cat’s claws hit the wrong spot, there should be at least some
fragments of the safe remaining. But even those are missing.  
  
“A safe?! More importantly, what’s going on here?! Did you do this?!”  
  
The leader shouted, still sitting down.  
My hood is off, so he can see me, and he must realize I’m a toddler.  
But I guess he can’t connect what’s happening in front of him with me.  
I sighed and extended the claws on my right hand.  
  
“Yes, it’s like this. — Cat’s Claw!”  
  
I unleashed my \[Cat’s Claw\] towards the rubble I piled up when I
separated the people from the wood.  
Five lines went straight towards the rubble, leaving a large scar the
moment they hit, pulverizing the pile.  
  
“Y-you’re kidding…”  
“I’m not.”  
  
The strongest three-year-old.  
  
“Where’s the safe?”  
  
Whatever. Now that he knows my power, I want him to tell me where the
safe is as soon as possible.  
So I asked my question again, but the leader just started muttering
something to himself.  
  
“Damn it, because of what he said…damn it, I didn’t hear about this…damn
it!”  
  
He gritted his teeth and glared at me, snarling.  
  
“The guys who disappeared with the promissory notes…were you behind that
too…I get it! You have a grudge against Mayor Shultem…!”  
  
...No, not really? I've never met him.  
But it’s a hassle, so I’ll just nod.  
Apparently, that was what he wanted, and he excitedly continued.  
  
“That guy flaunts his women around…a vulgar old geezer. But he’s the
richest guy around here.”  
  
…I don’t know.  
I nodded again.  
  
“If it’s a cat-beast girl, he would probably want her. There are places
that would pay a lot for a kid like you… But why wipe us out? You can’t
survive around here if you go against Shultem.”  
“Fuuh.”  
“…It’s probably beyond the comprehension of a kid like you.”  
“Mhm. I don’t get it.”  
“What?!”  
“So, where’s the safe?”  
“Shut up!! If you don’t understand, I’ll tell you! Listen! Shultem
controls the politics of this area. Of course, the judicial system too.
He can fabricate crimes and move the soldiers. You’ll be publicly
pursued as a criminal! A kid like you thinks you’re a hero, right?”  
  
Having said that, the leader stopped barking.  
He let out a mocking laugh.  
  
“—You’re the villain! That’s how it is in this town!!”  
  
He pointed directly at me.  
I am the bad guy.  
  
“Try to lay a hand on me. You'll never be able to live a normal life."  
  
—A triumphant smile.  
  
The leader judged me to be a child from my appearance, and thought that
if he showed me the concepts of good and evil, the future, and living as
a criminal, I would hesitate.  
I tilted my head at his words.  
  
“It’s fine, though.”  
“Wha?!”  
“I travel a lot.”  
“Huh?!”  
  
Being called evil by a small town’s leader and his debt collectors…  
Even if I’m condemned as evil in this small town and its surroundings…  
It's absolutely no problem for my life!  
And—  
  
“I’ll tell you something good.”  
  
I clenched my fists wearing the \[Cat’s Paw Gloves\].  
When I clapped my hands together, the touching paw pads made a squeaky
sound.  
  
"As long as no one finds out, it's okay."  
  
See!  
So.  
  
“I got the information.”  
  
I kicked off the floor, instantly closing the distance, and lowered my
waist.  
I jumped into the lap of the leader sitting down, and what I found was a
wide-open jaw.  
I tightened my armpits, bent my elbows. My palms facing myself—OK!  
  
“Cat Punch!”  
  
While raising my waist, I thrust my right hand towards the leader’s
jaw.  
\[Cat Punch\]. It’s an uppercut!  
  
“Become a star!”  
“Uguaaaaah!”  
  
—Another star fell.
