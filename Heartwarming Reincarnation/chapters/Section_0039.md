# Chapter 39・I Received a Letter

I walked down the main street of Reoliga with Samyu.  
We bought food from various stalls along the way.  
Grilled meat on skewers and milk tea.  
We sat side-by-side on a bench, and Samyu handed me some meat.  
  
“Lady Reni, this appears to be mutton.”  
“Mutton.”  
“Reoliga is developed, but large grasslands are spread across the
outskirts. The villages beyond seem to be raising sheep.”  
  
I nodded in agreement with Samyu.  
On our way to Reoliga, we had visited villages that raised cattle, but
none that raised sheep.  
  
“This drink seems to be made with sheep or goat milk. Both might have a
slightly unique taste. Please don't hesitate to tell me if you can't
drink it; I'll take it."  
“Mhm. Thank you.”  
  
I chuckled in response to Samyu’s concern.  
Even before arriving in the city, Samyu subtly recommended local
specialties.  
I think she did a lot of research beforehand, ever since I said I wanted
to travel.  
The game I loved so much… experiencing this world with my own five
senses is truly enjoyable.  
It probably would’ve been fun even if I had traveled alone, but thanks
to Samyu, it’s been even more fulfilling.  
  
“Let’s eat!”  
  
I took a bite of the meat Samyu gave me.  
The mutton, cut about 5mm thick, tore along the grain.  
I put the whole piece in my mouth and chewed…  
  
“Delicious!”  
  
Unlike beef, the mutton itself definitely has a bit of a unique taste.
It smells like grass? That’s what it feels like.  
But the scent was softly enveloped in a generous amount of spices.  
The firm texture became more flavorful the more I chewed it, and it went
perfectly with the slightly sweet and spicy sauce! Oh, but…  
  
“Samyu, it’s spicy…”  
  
The spice is quite strong.  
I’m sure it’d be easy for me to eat as a high school girl, but with a
four-year-old's body, the spiciness is a little painful…  
  
“I’m sorry! I asked for less spice, but…”  
“Drink…”  
“Yes!”  
  
I handed Samyu the skewer with the half-eaten meat and received milk tea
in exchange.  
I took a sip of the beige-colored drink, and my mouth felt pleasantly
warm.  
  
“Delicious.”  
  
The burning sensation in my mouth softened and melted away.  
The richness of the milk fat and the warmth of the drink gently erased
the spice from my mouth.  
  
“Amazing… Samyu, this combination is amazing!”  
“Are you alright? Is it too spicy?”  
“The meat alone is spicy, but together, it’s just right!”  
“I’m glad.”  
  
Samyu let out a relieved sigh.  
  
“How’s the flavor? Do you mind it?”  
“It smells like grass, but it doesn’t bother me.”  
  
The drink also had a grassy scent, different from cow’s milk, but it
also appears to have spices, so it’s not unpleasant.  
  
“Lady Reni, would you like more?”  
“Mhm!”  
  
I took some more meat from Samyu and took a bite. As expected, it was
spicy again, so I eased it with the drink. Yep. This combination is a
perpetual motion machine.  
While I ate earnestly, Samyu ate as well. Samyu’s meat seems to have
even more spice than mine, but she seems unfazed. She’s an adult… As
expected of a 130-year-old…  
So, after we finished exploring the main street, we headed towards an
inn before evening to secure our lodging for the night.  
Walking hand-in-hand with Samyu, we arrived in front of the inn. Before
opening the door, Samyu spoke in a voice only I could hear.  
  
“Lady Reni. The inn seems a little noisy. Just to be safe, could you
please activate your concealment?”  
“Mhm, got it.”  
  
At Samyu’s suggestion, I immediately put on the hood of my \[Hermit’s
Robe\].  
With this, I won’t be found.  
As soon as we entered the inn, just as Samyu said, someone was talking
at the reception desk…  
  
“If an elf guest with a child comes, please contact the city hall
immediately.”  
“That's fine, but…”  
  
A serious-looking man and a perplexed receptionist were talking to each
other. Samyu and I watched them.  
Judging from this conversation, it’s almost certainly us they are
looking for.  
I glanced at Samyu. Although she shouldn’t be able to see me, she nodded
knowingly.  
Then, she let go of my hand and approached the men who were talking.  
  
“Is there something you need from me?”  
  
Samyu spoke calmly and without emotion. As expected of Samyu. Calm and
collected.  
The two men who were spoken to turned around and looked at Samyu.  
Then, the receptionist exclaimed, “Whoa!”  
I’m sure it’s surprising if the person in question shows up while being
talked about. Especially since she’s a beautiful elf.  
But the other man didn’t seem particularly surprised; in fact, he
smiled.  
  
"That's convenient, I was looking for you."  
  
That face―  
  
“Ah, one of the knights.”  
  
―One of the knights who fought the dragon.  
I feel like he was one of the people I helped with my recovery
potions.  
  
“That voice…?”  
  
Because I unintentionally muttered that, the knight looked around
nervously.  
It was probably because he heard my voice but couldn't see me.  
  
“Is there something you need from me?”  
  
Samyu stood, blocking the knight’s view.  
It’s typical of Samyu that her line is exactly the same.  
  
“My apologies. I was looking for you to give you this.”  
  
Saying so, the knight handed something to Samyu indiscreetly, so as not
to be seen by others.  
That was…a letter, maybe?  
Since I’m hidden and short, I could clearly see what the knight took out
of his pocket.  
A white envelope with a red wax seal.  
Samyu confirmed the wax seal and then tucked it away.  
  
“I will check it in a quiet place. If a reply is needed, how should I
contact you?”  
“In that case, please give the letter to a city guard or come to the
city hall.”  
“Understood.”  
  
The knight’s business seemed to be finished, and he bowed politely and
left.  
Samyu then checked in and got a room.  
I followed her as she was led to our room, still hidden.  
The room we were shown to is on the top floor. When we entered, it was
like a living room, and it seems to be the type of room with a separate
bedroom.  
After the person who showed us to the room left, Samyu and I were alone.
I removed my hood.  
  
“Samyu, what happened?”  
“Lady Reni, firstly, you must be tired, so please, have a seat here.”  
  
Samyu gestured to a large sofa in the living room.  
So, I sat down, and Samyu knelt at my feet. Then, she handed me the
envelope she had received from the knight.  
  
“Lady Reni, this wax seal is one that only the royal family can use.”  
  
The red wax seal is very conspicuous on the white envelope.  
The one Samyu pointed to had a lion wearing a crown engraved on it.  
Only the royal family can use this wax seal. In other words, the person
who sent this letter is a member of the royal family…  
  
“…It seems the person you saved from the dragon is this kingdom's
princess.”
