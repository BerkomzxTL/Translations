# Chapter 36・I Was Invited to a Tea Party

"Lady Reni!!?"  
  
As I was laughing at the dragon that had turned into a constellation, I
heard a flustered Samyu.  
Ah, that's right. I'm looking up at the sky even though I haven't lifted
my head. Yep. I've lost my balance again and I’m falling upside down.  
  
*‘Samyu, catch me!’*  
"Yes, with pleasure!!"  
  
When I made the request using \[Telepathy\], Samyu replied with a lively
voice. Both the volume and the slightly eager tone felt like an izakaya
greeting. (TN: An izakaya is a type of Japanese bar where they shout a
welcome when you walk in)  
She seemed to have already arrived at my landing point, and Samyu gently
caught me as I floated down.  
  
"Thank you."  
  
I looked up at Samyu to express my gratitude.  
Then, Samyu started trembling…  
  
"Ah, ah, ah... No, ah, love is in my hands. Ah"  
  
This is bad.  
  
"I'll get down."  
  
I lifted my body, which had been resting in Samyu's arms, and made a
gesture of getting down. Samyu gently lowered me to the ground.  
  
"Are you alright?"  
"Yes! I'm so sorry… Apparently, hugging you while seeing your form is
still much too strong of an attack for me… my love-endurance is
insufficient."  
"…Mmn."  
  
Samyu has a very serious look on her face.  
My hood came off during the battle with the dragon, so carrying me as I
was must have been difficult for Samyu. …I don't understand what she
meant by attack power and love endurance, though.  
  
"By the way, Lady Reni, do you feel anything unusual about your body?"  
"Unusual?"  
"Yes. I felt Lady Reni's mana when you attacked the dragon."  
"Reni can't use mana, though?"  
"Lady Reni was born from the Queen, an elf who lost control of her mana.
Whether you would be able to use mana in the future was unknown, but you
were able to make a guardian contract. I definitely felt mana just now,
so I wondered if something triggered it."  
"Hmm… ah, my chest was hot."  
"Your chest?"  
"Mhm. When I thought I could do it, it overflowed from my chest."  
"That might be Lady Reni’s \[Mana Manipulation\]."  
"Mana Manipulation!"  
  
That's what I wanted to do! Samyu uses it, and it's incredibly powerful,
right?!  
If I can do it now, that's great.  
  
"I’ll try again."  
"Yes. Don't push yourself."  
"I can. I can. Reni can do it."  
  
I focused my mind on my chest…  
  
"...Can."  
  
Come out, heat!  
  
"—… … …Mmn."  
  
Yes.  
  
"I can't."  
  
I don't feel the warmth at all.  
  
"The heat won’t come out."  
"That’s true. I don't sense Lady Reni's mana now either…"  
"I see…"  
  
I guess I can't do it right away… I'm not really sure why I was able to
do it in the first place.  
  
"I'm sorry. I wish I could explain it better, but \[Mana Manipulation\]
is often something elves are born with, and I don't know how to explain
it…"  
"No, it's okay. I’ll try again."  
  
My status shows \[Sealed\], and I think that's affecting it. My race is
elf, but I'm \[Sealed\], and my ears are round. It's only natural that
it'd be difficult for me to do the same things as a normal elf.  
  
"Won't give up."  
  
That's right! Because I did it once!  
I also tried over and over again in the game, and each time I got better
and could do more things. So, I just need to keep practicing and
training little by little.  
  
"Lady Reni…"  
  
When I nodded, saying I would work hard, Samyu's eyes welled up with
emotion.  
  
"Precious...how precious...Right now, my whole body is basking in Lady
Reni...!"  
  
As Samyu said that, she started trembling.  
…Mmm, I don't really understand.  
I looked up in confusion at the shaking Samyu.  
Then, a voice called out…  
  
"Hey, you!"  
  
A childish voice. It belonged to the girl who was in the carriage, the
one called 'Your Highness.'  
The distance between the carriage and us is about 10 meters. The girl
must have a pretty loud voice.  
  
"What?"  
  
While replying, I tilted my head to convey my feeling. The distance is
too far, so my voice probably won't reach her.  
Then, the girl in the beautiful dress beckoned me.  
  
"It's far! Come over here!"  
"Okay."  
  
I nodded and approached the carriage.  
The \[Detection Bell\] isn't ringing, and Samyu isn't stopping me, so
it'll probably be alright to get closer.  
  
"What's wrong?"  
  
I spoke to her after getting closer.  
When the girl saw me, she widened her eyes and was speechless.  
  
"So beautiful…"  
  
She whispered in a daze.  
She seems to have forgotten what she wanted to say after calling me
over.  
There were three women around the girl, all wearing the same black dress
and white apron. Are they uniforms?  
Everyone is looking at me with wide eyes, seemingly in shock.  
  
"Are you okay?"  
"Y-yes…!"  
  
The girl seems to have regained her composure, and hurriedly spoke.  
Her voice is still childish, but very dignified.  
  
"I saw you slay the dragon earlier. Very good work."  
"Mhm."  
"It's unfortunate that the soldiers were defeated, but I intend to order
the Mayor of Reoliga to take care of the aftermath."  
"Mhm."  
  
The broken carriage and the soldier escorts. Since what seemed to be
protecting the girl is gone, it would be best to ask the nearest city,
Reoliga, for aid.  
Judging from the way she said ‘order’, this girl is of higher status and
can probably make such demands.  
  
"…S-so… that…"  
  
The girl, who had been dignified until now, suddenly started
stammering.  
  
"What's wrong?"  
"N-nothing!"  
"Hmm?"  
  
I thought it was strange so I called out to her, but the girl just
glared at me and answered reflexively.  
She doesn't seem angry, but maybe she's scared because she saw me punch
a dragon. If that's the case, my presence might be scary, so I guess
it's time to go.  
  
"Reni's going now."  
"Eh, ah, th-that's not it!"  
"Hm?"  
"Um, well... I need you to wait."  
"Wait?"  
"Just a little! Just a little!"  
"Mmn."  
  
I don't understand, but she seems to want me to wait, so I nodded on the
spot.  
Then, the girl spun around and ran towards the three women.  
  
"What should I do!? I can't find the words!"  
"It's okay, Your Highness! Fight!"  
"It was going great up to a certain point!"  
"If you just invite her properly, it'll be as we practiced!"  
"…But I suddenly got scared thinking about being rejected."  
*'…Your Highness'*  
"Because a girl as beautiful as her… would never…"  
  
The girl's dejected aura is very visible, even from behind.  
Apparently, she wants to say something to me, but can’t bring herself to
do it because she’s afraid of being rejected.  
I understand the situation now, so I’ll call out to her.  
  
"It's okay."  
"Eh…?"  
"Reni will listen."  
  
Because I'm a four-year-old who can wait patiently.  
  
"If you tell me, I'll think about it and answer."  
"…Understood."  
  
The girl turned around and stood in front of me with a tense
expression.  
  
"A-ah… that…"  
  
The girl's cheeks flushed red.  
She's truly speaking to me with all her heart.  
  
"To a tea party…!"  
"Tea party?"  
"I want you to come to a tea party!"  
  
The girl shouted this and quickly continued.  
  
"You protected me, didn't you? I want to repay you. I'll be talking to
the Mayor of Reoliga soon, so it might take a while, but sometime today
in Reoliga City…"  
  
一After saying that in one breath, the girl suddenly looked startled.  
And then, the redness on her cheeks faded away in the blink of an eye.  
  
"...But, having a tea party with someone like me... might not be fun."  
  
Her eyes were sadly cast down.  
What a strange girl.  
She’s so composed and dignified, it's hard to believe she’s around my
age. And yet, she quickly loses confidence.  
  
"Don't worry."  
  
Because—  
  
"Whether it's fun or not, Reni decides."  
  
I decide how I feel.  
How I feel right now is—  
  
"The tea party sounds really fun."  
  
—If we spend time together, it will definitely be fun!  
  
"Thank you for inviting me."  
  
I smiled while looking at the girl in her brown eyes, and her cheeks
turned bright red.
