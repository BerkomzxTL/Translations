# Chapter 2・My Family Is in Big Trouble

Everyone dies someday.  
But I never thought it would be on Christmas. I died while still
incredibly excited. I died while dreaming of tomorrow. I wanted to enjoy
the game more…  
But, well, that can't be helped. In games, you come back to life when
you die, but in reality, you don’t.  
However, it seems reincarnation is a thing—  
  
“Such a cute girl.”  
“Ah, that’s right.”  
  
I’ve been reborn, retaining the memories of my past life as a shut-in
high school girl.  
Apparently, I’m really like a baby, and my body is completely
uncooperative.  
Clenching my hands is about all I can manage… My five senses, however,
seem more developed than a normal baby’s. I can clearly hear, see,
taste, and feel textures.  
  
My mother, who’s holding me, is incredibly beautiful, with silver hair
tied up and sparkling blue eyes. My father has brown hair and
unremarkable features, but I think his golden eyes are beautiful.  
I inherited my mother’s silver hair and my father’s golden eyes.
Overall, I’m very much like my mother—a future beauty, for sure! That’s
how I was born.  
Yes, it’s just like the character I loved from my favorite game.  
Of course, I’m a little girl now, so it’s more accurate to say it’s like
imagining what that character looked like as a child. When I get older,
I’ll undoubtedly become the character I used to play.  
  
—Could this be the world of my favorite game?  
—Could I have been reborn here?  
  
And that hunch turned into certainty.  
At first, as a baby, I couldn’t do anything, but I eventually learned to
pull myself up and walk on my own.  
Even with my high school memories and heightened senses, my physical
development is the same as a typical baby’s, so I could only do this
around the age of one. Speaking was also difficult; I just made sounds
like “da” and “ah,” but I finally managed to say this!  
  
“Shta-tush!”  
  
Status! I’m saying status!  
As for the pronunciation of sounds starting with "st," I'll practice
that later. Right now, what happened is what matters.  
  
“Fuwaa!”  
  
In response to the word “status,” a familiar screen suddenly appeared
before my eyes. It's no wonder that I couldn't help but shout out in
joy.  
This is what it said:  
  
\* Name: Reni Shurm Guora  
\* Race: Elf  
\* Age: 1  
\* Level: 999  
  
Wow! My level is already maxed out…!  
There are other detailed values like HP and MP, but those are maxed out
too. That’s because I played the game intensely and used items to keep
raising the maximum values—  
  
“Data, cawwied over!”  
  
My past life's game data has carried over into my current life……!  
—At the age of one, I’m already the strongest.  
With this, perhaps—  
  
“Aitem… bo, bock, chu!”  
  
Item box! I’m saying item box!  
I’ll practice saying “box” later. Right now, what’s happening before my
eyes is what’s important. Yes. This has also carried over.  
A long list of items. Almost all of them are maxed out.  
At the age of one, I feel like I already possess everything in this
world.  
  
“Fuwaa~…”  
  
I unconsciously let out a sigh of wonder.  
  
—This is the world of my favorite game, and I’ve been reborn here with
all my data intact.  
  
With that decided, there’s only one thing I want to do.  
  
"Twavel!"  
  
Go on a journey!  
  
—The incredibly beautiful Lake of Refreshing Rain.  
I wonder what color the exceptionally beautiful surface of the water,
depicted in CG, actually is.  
—The Forest of Reflection, which took me a long time to clear.  
How should I fight the enemies that copy my movements and mimic my
abilities?  
—The Ever-Shifting Desert, where the map changes every time.  
How does the dry wind and scattering sand actually change the terrain?  
  
I want to see everything. I want to know everything. I want to enjoy
this world to the fullest.  
I want to experience the world with my five senses; something I could
only previously see through a screen.  
I’m already the strongest at the age of one. Even if I travel this world
solo, just like in my past life, I probably won’t have any trouble. I
understand how to live in this world much better than I did in my past
life as a high school girl.  
  
—I’m so excited.  
  
That excitement I felt before I died is returning.  
Yes. Maybe there’s a jewel somewhere. I can search for that while
traveling.  
I accidentally let out a quiet chuckle, and the wooden frame of the bed
I was leaning against creaked.  
  
“Reni…?”  
  
Reacting to the sound, a man sleeping in the bed spoke.  
A weak voice. He called the name given to me in this life, “Reni.”  
  
“Are you… alright?”  
“Papa.”  
“……Yes, I see… good……”  
  
When I pulled myself up, the man sleeping in the bed—my father—opened
his eyes slightly, looking pained.  
His complexion was pale, and his breathing was labored.  
  
—Yes. My father is sick.
