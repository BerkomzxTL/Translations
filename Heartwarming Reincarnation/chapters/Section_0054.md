# Chapter 54・Let’s Defeat Them All

"Oh, what was that?"  
  
A voice came from beyond the door.  
Probably a guard who sensed something suspicious.  
Looks like he's coming into the room.  
  
"Everyone, huddle over there!"  
"“Understood!”"  
  
The children nodded at my words.  
While watching them run to the wall, I quickly moved to the side of the
door and stood next to the hinges. Since it’s a push door, I shouldn’t
be in sight even if he opens it and comes in.  
The moment the children and I finished moving, the doorknob turned with
a \*click\*, and the door opened.  
  
"Wh… What is this? What…"  
  
The man who entered mumbled.  
Perhaps he found Fossil A embedded in the wall.  
The door is directly in front of me, so I can’t see the guard's
expression, but I think he’s probably dumbfounded. There’s a sense of
confusion in his voice.  
I couldn't help but chuckle at his cluelessness—  
  
"Damn it! Who's there!? Who laughed?!"  
  
—The guard's angry shout echoed.  
He must have heard my laughter.  
Well, I was asked a question, so I should answer properly.  
  
"It's Reni."  
  
I'm the strongest four-year-old.  
  
"What!? You're there!?"  
  
The guard seems to have located the source of my voice and roughly
closed the door.  
Now we could both see each other's faces.  
Yep, he's angry.  
  
"You, you little brat, you know what this means, right?"  
  
The guard theatrically clenched his right fist in front of his chest and
hit his left hand with it.  
A nasty \*thwack\*. It's a threat.  
  
"Uh… hic…"  
  
At that moment, the children huddled by the wall trembled fearfully.  
  
"Is that a punch?"  
  
I tilted my head, and a blue vein throbbed on the man's temple.  
  
"Cut it out! Just because you're merchandise doesn't mean I'll go easy
on you!"  
"Mhm. Fine."  
  
The man reached out to grab me.  
I dodged it with a side step.  
  
"Let me show you."  
  
Then, I clenched my fist.  
  
"Cat Punch!"  
  
I drew back my right hand and spread my legs.  
Then, using my weight, I slammed my fist into the man's lower abdomen.  
  
"Become a fossil!"  
"GAAAA!?"  
  
The man who received my punch screamed and sank into the wall.  
  
"Okay."  
  
That's a punch.  
  
"Amazing!"  
"You're so strong!"  
"Cool!"  
  
The children who had taken refuge by the wall gathered around me, just
like the first time.  
So, I looked up at them and nodded.  
  
"There are more. I'll take them down."  
  
The next room seems to be the men's waiting area.  
It would be safer to defeat everyone there before escaping.  
  
"Just wait here."  
  
Fossils A and B were lined up in the wall.  
Leaving the children in the room, I went out into the corridor.  
  
"This room."  
  
Before I got here, there were only three doors. One is the priest's room
where Samyu was taken. Another is the prison cell where I was taken. The
last one is the one all the men went into. So, there must be a lot of
them there.  
To check what was inside, I quietly put my ear to the door.  
  
"It seems this place is no longer needed."  
"Seriously? So this is our last job?"  
"What should we do next? There hasn't been a job this easy and
profitable."  
"Just threatening the children they sent us should be good money."  
"If we're leaving, should we attack the village?"  
"Right. This village is an accomplice anyway. We can threaten them for
their property, or take the children hostage."  
"If they're useless, we can just kill everyone."  
"Exactly."  
  
From the conversation I overheard, it seems that the goal that needed
this basement and the village was accomplished.  
And it seems they intend to take everything from the village at the
end.  
The children, cowering in fear. The parents trembling.  
The stew with sleeping pills was delicious.  
The village is quiet now, but it’s clear there was once a daily life
here.  
The ones who destroyed it was—  
  
"I'm here."  
  
I opened the door and entered.  
It's about 20 tatami mats? Quite spacious. A large desk and many chairs
were in the center. There are beds lined up against the walls.  
  
"Oh? Who's there?"  
  
The men inside all looked at me at once. There are about ten of them.  
They were probably surprised because I was supposed to have been locked
up with the children.  
  
"Hey, hey, what happened to the guy who carried her and the guard?"  
"She escaped, didn't she?"  
"They couldn't even watch a brat, those guys."  
  
The men exchanged glances and shrugged their shoulders wearily.  
Then, the man closest to me reached out.  
  
"Now, you come over he—"  
"Cat Punch!"  
  
—\*SHWACK!\*  
  
"Okay."  
"Wha?"  
"Ah?"  
"Eh?"  
  
A man embedded in the wall, and me confirming with my index finger.  
After looking at each other alternately, the men in the room finally
seemed to understand the situation after a while.  
The men sitting down stood up, causing their chairs to clatter.  
  
"You brat!"  
"You dare to underestimate us!!"  
"Damn it!"  
"Come at me!!"  
"Wait wait! Beastkin are strong, did you see that just now?!"  
  
The enraged men seemed ready to come straight at me, but one man stopped
them.  
  
"Don't rush in!"  
  
Then, looking at me, he quietly whispered to his companions.  
  
"…Lure her in. Even if she's strong, she's still a child."  
"That's right…"  
"Appeal to her conscience."  
  
―I can hear everything, though.  
  
"Did you come to defeat us?"  
"It's not like that. We were forced to…"  
"This guy hurt his leg."  
  
The men's pained voices.  
Then one man beckoned me over.  
At the central table. Sitting on a chair, he was painfully touching his
right leg.  
  
"Because of this leg, I can't get a proper job. It can't be helped. You
understand, right?"  
  
Following the gesture, I approached slowly.  
I could tell the men were gauging the distance between us, but I walked
straight ahead without concern.  
  
"That's right, isn't it? Over here—!!"  
"Jump!"  
  
The man who said he hurt his leg leaned forward to catch me.  
I quickly jumped up to avoid him.  
  
"Safe."  
  
And then I landed on the large central table.  
Right in the center of the room.  
  
"Haha! I can’t believe you made it easier for yourself to be caught!"  
"A small kid like you is easier to catch if you're on a table!"  
  
When a tall adult tries to catch a shorter person, they have to bend
down.  
This throws off their balance, and if their footing is disturbed, it
makes it hard to catch them.  
Seeing me on the table, all the men burst out laughing.  
They could catch me simply by reaching out their hands while standing.  
  
"You idiot!!"  
"Okay, grab her!!"  
"Hold her down!!"  
  
Hands reached out from all sides to grab me.  
Before they could catch me, I spun around on the table.  
  
"Cat's Tail, Whirlwind!"  
  
My tail spun with me, hitting the faces of the men who were leaning over
the table to reach for me.  
  
—\*WHAP! WHAP! WHAP!\*  
  
In one rotation, I hit five of them. And the men I hit with my tail went
flying towards the wall.  
Furthermore, the wind generated by the spin blew the other men away—  
  
"Gwah!"  
"Ugh!?"  
"Heeee!?"  
  
All of them at once!  
  
"Become fossils!"  
  
—\*CRASH!\*  
  
"Okay."  
  
The men were firmly embedded in the walls on all sides.  
After confirming this, I left the room.  
Then, I went to the room where the children were waiting and took them
all home.  
  
"Go straight ahead from here. Do you know the stairs?"  
"Yes! We use them every morning."  
  
Since they said they met every morning for prayers, the children seem to
know the way from the basement to the church through the mechanism.  
There are eight children. From the hallway, I can see them all climbing
the stairs.  
Then, suddenly, the whole building started shaking.  
  
"Earthquake?"  
  
Then, a \*rumble\* as something broke, and the shaking got stronger.  
Then, the stairs the children were climbing up collapsed.  
  
"Ah!!"  
"Are you okay?"  
"It’s fine here! But come quickly, or you…"  
  
The oldest child called out to me downstairs while shielding the other
children.  
I went to where the stairs had fallen and looked up.  
The church floor seems to be closing, too, but there’s still a gap. I
could probably get out if I used \[Jump\]…  
  
*'Lady Reni! I'm sorry, a human man activated the mechanism!'*  
*'Mechanism?'*  
*'Yes, it's the same as the one the mayor of that town used, to destroy
the underground structure.'*  
*'Understood.'*  
*'I'll come rescue you right away!'*  
*'No, I'm fine here. How's Samyu?'*  
*'I'm fine. This room seems to be indestructible.'*  
*'Then stay where you are. Reni’s coming right away.'*  
  
Samyu's \[Telepathy\].  
Thanks to that, I was able to grasp the situation.  
The mayor of Slanita, Shultem. There was also a collapsing mechanism in
the basement of his mansion. That red crystal. Apparently, this basement
could also be destroyed.  
I muttered to myself, "I see."  
Then, a worried voice came from above—  
  
"It's dangerous!"  
"Hurry!"  
  
It was the children I saved. They were desperately reaching out their
hands from the gap in the floor.  
But I shook my head.  
  
"It’s okay. It's dangerous, so go back."  
  
It would be terrible if you got pinched.  
I still have things to do.  
  
"Everyone, go home."  
  
The closing floor, the falling stairs, and the collapsing corridor.  
I waved goodbye with a smile.
