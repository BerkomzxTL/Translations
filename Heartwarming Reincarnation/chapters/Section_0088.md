# Chapter 88・The Village Is Back to Normal!…Right?

I immediately returned to \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\] to check if it
worked.  
The water level hadn't changed much yet, but the water veins seemed to
be connected properly, and the lakebed was steadily soaking in water.  
  
"Naga, feels better?"  
  
I called out to the water snake coiled at the bottom of the lake.  
When I first met it, it was sluggish and seemed listless, but now it
raised its head quickly and smartly.  
Its forked tongue flickered.  
  
*'Water, returned.'*  
"Mhm. Let's fight when it's full."  
  
When I said that, the water snake returned its head to the lakebed. It
seemed to be feeling the overflowing water with its whole body.  
Its body, which had been submerged in shallow water, was wriggling
happily.  
With the water returning, I should be able to fight the strong water
snake.  
  
"How long will it take to fill up?"  
"I wonder. At this rate, about a week, perhaps."  
"This lake is big, after all. It'll take about that long for the water
level to return to normal."  
"I see…"  
  
It’ll take longer than I thought. Once something is broken, it's
difficult to restore it. So if it can be restored in a week, I think
that’s a great achievement.  
  
"Then, I'll go to the village in the meantime."  
"The village at the foot of the mountain?"  
"Mhm. To return the money."  
  
So, we headed to the village at the foot of the mountain.  
The village has the appearance of a typical farming village. There were
several water wheels, and originally, they must have cultivated many
crops using the abundant water source flowing from \[The Lake of
Refreshing Rain\].  
Now, however, the water channels were dry, and the water wheels had
stopped. Only a few of the many fields had crops planted.  
The villagers' faces were uniformly gloomy. Water is truly essential for
a farming village.  
Samyu, Hamu, and I entered the village. Immediately, a woman called out
to us.  
  
"Are you travelers?"  
"Yes, we are."  
"My, you've come all the way to this countryside… Are you here to see
the famous giant water wheel?"  
  
She pointed to a spot in the village.  
There was a very large water wheel there. The largest of several.  
  
"Giant water wheel?"  
"Oh, you didn't come to see the giant water wheel? Whenever travelers
come to this village, they all come to see it…"  
"Indeed, it's a very large water wheel. You use it to irrigate the
fields, right?"  
  
Samyu nodded, saying, "I see."  
Apparently, the large water wheel is a tourist attraction in this
village.  
  
"The sight of the giant water wheel carrying water was very popular.
People praised the powerful wheel and the beautiful water. The sound of
the wood creaking and groaning was also popular…"  
"Reni wants to see it!"  
  
I was so excited by the wonderful tourist information that I couldn’t
help but blurt out.  
However, the woman frowned apologetically.  
  
"...I'm sorry. It's stopped now."  
"Ah… Because the water ran out?"  
"Yes… It may never move again."  
  
Hamu shrugged in exasperation.  
The woman bowed her head sadly.  
  
"It was so... so beautiful..."  
  
After saying that, she quickly wiped her eyes with a handkerchief.  
Thinking about the future of the village, she must be feeling
miserable.  
I gently grasped her hand.  
  
"It's okay."  
  
The woman looked up.  
I nodded reassuringly, "Mhm."  
  
"Everything will be back to normal."  
  
Yep. All solved!  
However, since the lake's water level hasn't returned yet, the village's
water channels are still dry. She probably didn't understand what I
meant.  
However, she squeezed my hand tightly in return.  
  
"…Yes… Thank you. I feel a little better."  
"Mhm. Please wait."  
  
It seems it will take about a week for the lake to fill up.  
Just then, an old man passed by. That's—  
  
"The one from the reservoir."  
  
—The man who had the leather pouch containing money at the reservoir.  
  
"Ah, do you know the village chief?"  
"Chief."  
  
Nodding at the woman's words, "I see." That old man is the village
chief. In other words, the most important person in this village. He
must have brought that money on behalf of the village.  
He had a very gloomy expression, probably because he couldn't obtain the
land deed, had his money taken, and was in the worst possible
situation.  
I released the woman's hand and approached the village chief.  
Then, I presented what I was holding, saying, "Here."  
  
“This.”  
"Ah, are you a traveler? Do you need something from this old man...?"  
"Mhm. This fell."  
  
What I handed him was the leather pouch containing money.  
The moment he recognized what it was, the village chief's despondent
eyes widened.  
  
"Th-this is!? The one we had just now…‼ Wh-why do you have this!? What's
going on!?"  
  
Ignoring the surprised village chief, I handed him the leather pouch.
Furthermore, I also handed him the leather portfolio I had under my
\[Hermit's Robe\], saying, "Here."  
  
"It fell."  
  
Instantly, his eyes widened further.  
  
"Th-this is!? Th-the land, d-deed…!?"  
"Mhm. It fell."  
  
Without paying any attention to the village chief’s surprise, I handed
him the leather portfolio as well.  
Alright. Mission complete!  
I tried to move away from the village chief. However, it didn't go
well—  
  
"W-wait… no, please wait…! This, this is extremely important to our
village. R-really, did it really fall...?"  
"…Mhm."  
  
He came around in front of me and knelt on the ground. For some reason,
he started speaking politely, and his enthusiasm was incredible.  
When I involuntarily took a step back, Samyu gently supported me from
behind.  
I had planned to simply say "it fell," but apparently, that didn't work
out well.  
  
"Could it be that you have saved us…? Please, please, tell us what
happened…!"  
  
Saying that, the village chief called out to the villagers who seemed to
have been watching the situation.  
  
"Everyone! These people have recovered the land deed and the money we
were supposed to use to buy it back…‼ Come here!"  
“““No way!!”””  
  
Uh… something amazing has happened… Before I knew it, many villagers
were kneeling behind the village chief, looking up at me…  
This is strange… When I returned the IOU to my parents saying "it fell,"
it went smoothly… Why… why did this become such a big deal…?  
  
"Sa… Samyu."  
  
Without thinking, I tugged on the hem of Samyu's skirt, showing my
anxiety. I need to consult…  
  
"Kghh…!"  
  
My action seemed to stimulate something in Samyu, and her eyes briefly
turned white. Ah…  
However, she seemed to have braced herself, deciding that now is not the
time. Although her body was still trembling slightly, she regained her
composure.  
  
"…Everyone, please listen calmly. I understand the plight of this
village, although not the whole story. A farming village deprived of its
water source. I feel for you."  
  
Samyu comforted the villagers with a dignified voice.  
The sight of Samyu, a beautiful elf girl, gathering the peoples' gazes
and giving a speech-like address was picturesque… Although her body is
still shaking.  
  
"The ones causing you all suffering are gone, and the deed and money
have been returned. And… \[The Lake of Refreshing Rain\] will eventually
return to its former water level in due time, and your lives will return
to normal."  
“““Ohhhhhhh…!!”””  
"It seems that water is flowing into the water channels right now."  
  
At Samyu's words, the villagers turned their gazes to the waterways.
There, indeed, a small amount of water was flowing into the water
channels that had been dry until now.  
  
"It's true…!"  
"The water… the water is returning…!"  
"I'm so glad, I'm so glad…!!""  
  
The villagers rejoiced at the sight of the water channels. They were
cheering, and some were embracing each other.  
Samyu took a moment to let them share their joy.  
Then, when the time seemed right, she spoke again in a dignified
voice.  
  
"Who? Why? How? Of course, such questions are natural. But, they are
trivial."  
  
Samyu paused there.  
The villagers were captivated by Samyu's aura and swallowed hard.  
Samyu looked down at the villagers and declared bluntly.  
  
"This—is a miracle."  
"""Ooooohhhh…"""  
"This young body embodies a miracle."  
"""Ooooo…"""  
  
Saying that, Samyu took my hand as if handling something precious.  
Then, the villagers' eyes focused on me—  
  
"You need only give thanks.—That a miracle has descended upon you
here."  
"""Oooooooo…!!!"""  
  
The villagers' cheers spread like an earthquake.  
No, but, um, what's going on…? Shouldn't I hide my power?  
I hurriedly used \[Telepathy\] to send a message to Samyu.  
  
*'Sa-Samyu, Samyu… What's going on?'*  
*'Lady Reni. I judged that hiding your power is impossible this
time.'*  
*'Mmn.'*  
  
That's… right. The "it fell" strategy didn't work at all.  
  
*'Therefore, I judged that raising your power to the level of faith
would be best.'*  
*'Faith…'*  
  
That means worship, reverence, and that kind of thing, right?  
  
*'Humans, when they believe something is the same as them, tend to think
about using or incorporating it. However, a miracle belongs to no
one.'*  
*'I see…'*  
  
I understand, but I don't understand…  
However, it's probably good that the villagers are captivated by the
atmosphere and aren't thinking about "who did it, and how."  
I can't explain what I did with magic, the item box, and equipment.  
  
"Now! Let us worship. The miracle!! Bathe in its presence!!"  
"""Oooooooo!!"""  
  
…Bathe?  
Facing Samyu inciting the crowd and the enthusiastic villagers, I
quietly closed my eyes.
